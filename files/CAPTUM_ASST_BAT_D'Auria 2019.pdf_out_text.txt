Introduction: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is characterized by recurrent itchy wheals, angioedema or
both, that persist for longer than six weeks. In children, up to 40% of chronic spontaneous urticaria is due to
mast cells and basophils-activating autoantibodies, mostly directed against the IgE high-affinity receptor subunit
(FceRI). Indirect basophil activation test (BAT) has been proposed in the diagnosis of autoimmune urticaria.
Materials and methods: Sera from sixteen patients, aged from 2 to 15 yrs, with CSU were evaluated through
indirect BAT by flow cytometry using a commercial kit (Flow CAST®, BUHLMANN Laboratories, Schonenbuch,
Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Results: Indirect BAT test gave a much better diagnosis in our cohort than the gold standard ASST. Six children
(37.5%) showed a positive indirect BAT while we could perform ASST in only 3 patients with just one patients
showing a positive ASST. The specificity of BAT positive results was confirmed by the absence of significant
difference between the BAT results obtained from negative controls vs negative sera of the patient (p = 0.65) on
the basophil donors, indicating that the serum is not activating basophil per se.

Conclusions: This pilot study suggests the utility of BAT to identify the subtype of autoimmune CSU in children in

clinical practice.

 

1. Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is characterized by recurrent
itchy wheals and angioedema that appear without any identifiable
cause (Zuberbier et al., 2018). The condition is defined as recurrent
urticaria, occurring for at least 6 weeks. In children, approximately
35-40% of chronic spontaneous urticaria is considered due to autoimmune mechanisms (Sahiner et al., 2011). CSU has been found to be
associated with several autoimmune diseases, like thyroid diseases,
rheumatoid arthritis, type I diabetes mellitus, Sjorgen syndrome, celiac
disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus (Confino-Cohen et al.,
2012). An autoimmune background for CSU is supported by the observation of immediate wheals and flare responses after an autologous
serum skin test (ASST) in CSU patients (Sabroe et al., 1999). These
patients show circulating auto-antibodies, directed towards the highaffinity IgE receptor subunit (FceRI) and IgE itself (Jirapongsananuruk
et al., 2010; Fiebiger et al., 1995; Hide et al., 1993).

Currently, the in vivo ASST is recommended to identify the subtype
of autoimmune urticaria (AIU) in the diagnostic workup of CSU
(Zuberbier et al., 2018). However, ASST can not be used in case of
concomitant treatment with antihistamines, that is quite frequent in
clinical practice.

Indirect basophil activation test (BAT), intended as the in vitro
stimulation of heterologous basophils from peripheral blood donors
mediated by the serum of CSU patients, followed by the flow cytometric
determination of the basophils activation, has been proposed as an
useful tool for the assessment of autoimmune chronic urticaria to
overcome the ASST limitations (Hoffmann et al., 2015). BAT offers
several advantages: it is less invasive than ASST and does not carry the
risk of accidental infection by injections of autologous serum (Sabroe
et al., 1999). As well as ASST for mast cells, indirect BAT allows the
identification of patients expressing auto-antibodies able to activate
basophils, including anti-FceRI, anti-FceRII and anti-IgE, even if it is not
able to exactly distinguish which autoantibody is present in the serum.

Indeed, a positive BAT can indicate that CSU in patients has an autoimmune basis (Hide et al., 1993; Hoffmann et al., 2015; Gruber et al.,
1988).

Several BAT have been assessed in adult CSU patients, and CD63
and CD203c are held to be the most reliable markers (Yasnowsky et al.,
2006; Irinyi, 2013). While several studies have evaluated the employment of BAT in adult patients (Hoffmann et al., 2015; Curto-Barredo
et al., 2016; Rauber et al., 2017; Gentinetta et al., 2011), very few data
exist on children. To our knowledge, a single study by Netchiporouk
et al. evaluated BAT test performance, aiming to standardize it in Canadian CSU children cohort (Netchiporouk et al., 2016). In that study
the authors evaluated a clinical cut-off for sera from CSU pediatric
patients on one basophil donor and subsequently evaluated the reproducibility of the results with randomly chosen sera from different
patients group on a second healthy non atopic donor.

Our study is a real life study to investigate the potential benefit of
the indirect BAT in the daily practice for the diagnosis of AIU in children with CSU. The goal of our pilot study is to generate proof of
concept data that might be worthy of further and deeper investigation
with clinical validations.

2. Materials and methods

This study was carried out between April 2015 and September 2017
at two University Hospital in Northern Italy. Subjects were recruited
and evaluated at the Pediatric Allergy and Immunology Unit of San
Matteo Hospital in Pavia and at the Pediatric Allergy Unit of Vittore
Buzzi Children’s Hospital in Milan.

We analyzed sera from pediatric CSU patients through indirect BAT
in flow cytometry using a commercial kit (Flow CAST®, BUHLMANN
Laboratories, Schonenbuch, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the presence of auto-antibodies in patients sera able to activate basophils was evaluated incubating 50 ul of
patient serum with 50 ul of EDTA whole blood from 3 independent
heterologous donors of basophils. The stimulation was performed for
15 min at 37°C in a stimulation buffer included in the kit, containing
calcium and IL3, and a staining reagent including anti CD63-FITC and
anti CCR3-PE antibodies. The flow cytometry analysis was performed
calculating the percentage of activated basophils, determined as the
percentage of CD63 positive cells in the population of CCR3pos/SSClow
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Basal activation and positive control activation by a monoclonal antibody anti FceRI receptor
included in the kit was checked on each of the independent basophil
donors. We included sera from sixteen patients, aged from 2 to 15 years,

31

all suffering from CSU of unknown etiology. Donor basophils were
obtained from healthy, non-atopic donors.

BAT tests were considered positive accordingly to the technical
cutoff of the Flow CAST® test indicated by the manufacturer: (i) the
percentage of CD63pos basophils > 5%, and (ii) the stimulation index
SI that must be equal or higher than 2 (SI is defined as the percentage of
CD63pos basophils induced by the serum patient divided by the percentage of CD63pos induced by the negative control). The patient
serum was considered positive in the indirect basophil activation when
at least one donor was positive.

The majority of subjects were also evaluated according to our
clinical practice for allergy (serum total IgE and specific IgE levels)
using ImmunoCAP® test system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and concurrent autoimmune diseases by auto-immunity tests, including antithyroid autoantibodies (anti-thyroglobulin and thyroid microsomal
antibodies), that were detected by radioimmunoassay, and anti-nuclear
antibody (ANA) detected by an indirect fluorescent antibody technique.

Skin prick test reactivity to common aero and food allergens were
also determined.

ASST was performed according to European guidelines, in subjects
not undergoing therapy with antihistamines.

Written informed consent was obtained from the children’s parents
or legal guardians prior to conducting any study-related investigation.
The research protocol was approved by the Local Ethic Committee of
the Hospitals (N° 27980).

3. Results

The clinical features and main results of ASST and BAT are summarized in Table 1.

Despite the indication of the guidelines, in our cohort ASST could
not be performed in the majority of subjects (80.5%) due to concomitant treatment with antihistamines. We could perform ASST only
in three patients for whom the absence of concomitant medications
allowed reliable results of the test. Two of them resulted negative and
one positive by this method.

To overcome this limitation, all the patients were assessed by the
indirect BAT to identify the presence of autoantibodies able to activate
donor basophils from three independent healthy donors. Six children
(37.5%) of our cohort showed a positive indirect BAT on at least one
donor basophils. We used 5% of CD63pos basophil as cutoff to define
positive sera, that is the technical cutoff of the commercial kit used to
set a standardized assay for real clinical use of BAT results. No significant difference was observed between the BAT results obtained from
E. D'Auria et al.

negative controls on the basophil donors vs patient sera that gave negative basophil activation (p = 0.65), indicating that the serum is not
activating basophil per se and that each activation observed was specific. Considering our results as a pilot experiment, the technical cutoff
should be further explored with serum from healthy pediatric donors to
exclude any non-specific effect of serum factors.

Due to the low number of patients, it was not possible to make a
correlation between indirect BAT and ASST. Nevertheless, the patients
with negative ASST showed a positive result with the indirect BAT,
while the only one who had a positive ASST was positive also to the
basophil test.

All patients were also screened for the presence of other autoantibodies to check possible concurrent autoimmune diseases. We
tested 12 patients of our small cohort for autoimmunity and we found
only three patients that resulted positive for antinuclear antibodies.
Noteworthy, all these three patients were also positive for BAT; among
them, one was found ASST positive and one was found ASST negative,
respectively. One of the BAT positive patient was negative for autoimmune test while on 2 BAT positive patients we did not perform the
autoimmunity tests.

We didn’t find any correlation between allergy status in terms of
sIgE and skin tests and BAT results.

4. Discussion

It’s important to emphasize the necessity of a proper diagnosis of
AIU, as it represents the most severe form of chronic urticaria. Similarly
to mast cells, basophils express IgE receptors on their surface. Crosslinking by IgE and an antigen or an antibody results in cell activation
and secretion of cytokines, chemokines, and other mediators
(Schroeder, 2011). It has been demonstrated that CD63, a cell surface
marker, is not expressed on resting basophils, but it is up-regulated on
degranulating basophils (Knol et al., 1991). Indeed, indirect BAT test
using CD63 expression has been recently proposed to be used in the
diagnostic workup of different allergic diseases, including CSU
(Hoffmann et al., 2015; Szegedi et al., 2006). Furthermore, the possible
role of seruminduced BAT in the follow-up of patients on allergen immunotherapy and anti-IgE treatment or in monitoring the resolution of
allergy has been addressed (Hoffmann et al., 2015).

For which regards CSU, some studies have evaluated the employment of BAT in adult patients (Hoffmann et al., 2015; Curto-Barredo
et al., 2016; Rauber et al., 2017; Gentinetta et al., 2011), showing its
utility to identify patients with more active disease (Curto-Barredo
et al., 2016) and to determine distinct subtypes in adult with CSU
(Rauber et al., 2017). Conversely, very few and preliminary data exist
about the employment of BAT test in children with CSU. To our
knowledge, a single study by Netchiporouk et al. evaluated BAT test
performance, aiming to standardize it in Canadian CSU children cohort
(Netchiporouk et al., 2016).

Considering our cohort, ASST, that is the actual gold standard, was
not applicable in the majority of the patients due to concomitant
treatment with antihistamines. In this respect, we could perform ASST
in 3 patients only.

Conversely, we could screen all patients of our cohort suffering from
CSU applying BAT test. By the use of indirect BAT we could identify
37.5% of patients having AIU. Our result is quite in agreement with the
literature data showing a percentage of up to 40% of autoimmune urticaria in children (Sahiner et al., 2011; Konstantinou et al., 2013).
Even with the limitation of the small sample, our findings suggest that
BAT may be a useful test also in the pediatric population, for which we
experience more difficulties in performing ASST in clinical practice.

Indirect BAT may be a more feasible and sensitive test helping in the
diagnosis of children suffering from AIU among those with CSU, identifying subjects with circulating autoantibodies able to activate basophils and directed toward the IgE receptor. However, like ASST, indirect BAT is not able to exactly distinguish which autoantibody

32.

activate basophils, anti-FceRI, anti-FceRII or anti-IgE.

Even if with limited numbers, our findings also suggest that BAT
and ASST could give different results for patients (eg patients that can
be positive only for ASST or BAT, or both) that could be integrated for a
better diagnosis. However, an extended evaluation is necessary to define if this finding can be associated with a specific clinical phenotype.

Noteworthy, in our cohort BAT test resulted positive in the subjects
showing positive autoimmunity tests, like ANA. Conversely, it resulted
negative in the majority of subjects not showing them. This finding
permits to speculate that AIU might be considered an epiphenomenon
of a wider breakdown of the tolerance, that may affect multiple autoimmunity mechanism, including the IgE receptor on basophils and mast
cells.However, the small sample do not allow us to draw conclusions
about this issue, that should be further investigated.

At a methodological level, our study should be considered a pilot
study.

The strenght of our study is that it is the second study showing data
from children suffering from CSU, beside the study by Netchiporouk
et al (Netchiporouk et al., 2016). In that study, the authors proposed a
more sensitive cut-off at 1.8% in children, using the same standard
assay.

Conversely, we adopted the technical cutoff of 5% CD63 pos basophils based on the standardized assay indicated by the manufacturer, as
lower cut-off may not discriminate betweennonspecific and specific
basophil activation. We observed no significant difference between the
BAT results obtained from negative controls on the basophil donors vs
sera of patient with negative result (p = 0.65), indicating the absence of
non-specific activation mediated by serum factors and the validity of
the cutoff adopted. Nevertheless, an extended evaluation of the technical cut-off with negative sera from healthy donor or from patient with
urticaria from known etiology should be performed to increase the
robustness of the data obtained for children sera. In contrast with the
findings of Netchiporouk et al, we observed positive BAT test only on
some of the heterologous basophil donors and not in all of them, with a
casual behavior, and it was not possible to find one donor better than
another. This finding is in agreement with the findings of Gentinetta
et al. (2011) that suggested that modulating the quantity of IL3 in the
stimulation can bypass this effect. We believe that in real clinical
practice this approach is not feasible since it would imply major
changes in the assay test system at any testing day with a continuous reevaluation of the technical cutoff. We suggest that the use of multiple
donors in indirect BAT could be the best way to overcome this bias
effect of the basophil donor. Further investigation should be necessary
to further explore this initial finding.

Our pilot study shows that BAT may be considered a useful functional tool in the diagnostic work-up of CSU, helping in identifying the
subtype of autoimmune CSU in children. It is warranted to evaluate
BAT performance on a larger number of children suffering from CSU to
identify a clinical cut-off, prior to implementation in the routine clinical
practice.
