Introduction

Summary

Idiopathic histaminergic acquired angioedema (IH-AAE) is a common cause
of recurrent angioedema without wheals. It is a mast cell-mediated disease
thought to belong to the same clinical entity as chronic urticaria (CU). The
objective of this study was to describe the clinical and epidemiological
characteristics of IH-AAE patients. From 2014 to 2015, 534 patients were
seen at our national reference centre for angioedema and/or urticaria.
Among them, we identified 31 patients with idiopathic histaminergic
acquired angioedema without wheals (IH-AAE). Thirty-one patients (15
men and 16 women) with a mean age of 50 years met the criteria for THAAE. The average delay in diagnosis was 6-3 years. A history of allergy was
found in 12 patients (38-7%), nine suffering from allergic rhinitis. The mean
duration of attacks was 28-1 h. The AE attack was located in the upper
respiratory tract in 54-8% of cases (17 patients). A lingual location was
found in 29% of patients. Men were more likely than women to have an
upper airway involvement. No intubations or admissions to intensive care
units were reported. The dosage of anti-histamines to control the symptoms
was onefold the recommended dose in 51-6% of patients (16 patients),
twofold in 32% (10 patients) and three-fourfold in 16-1% (five patients).
TH-AAE is characterized by an important delay in diagnosis, a frequent
involvement of the upper airway and a benign course during attacks. As in
CU, a trial of up to fourfold dose of H1-anti-histamines may be necessary to
control symptoms.

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a highly prevalent condition
characterized by the occurrence of hives and/or angioedema (AE) for at least 6 weeks [1]. Both symptoms are
related to increased vasopermeability and vasodilation, in
the dermis for the former and in the hypodermis for the
latter. Hives manifest clinically as red or white, itchy and
transient papules, whereas AE is a deep and self-limiting
swelling of the hypodermis or the submucosal tissue [2].

In clinical practice, diseases can be classified into three
categories: diseases with urticaria without AE, diseases with
AE alone and conditions with both urticaria and AE [3,4].

In the subset of AE without urticaria, the aetiologies are
varied. A recent expert consensus established the definitions of the disease entities involved in this group: three
types of hereditary AE (HAE) have been identified (HAE

AE have been separated: idiopathic histaminergic AE (IHAAE), idiopathic non-histaminergic AE (InH-AAE),
acquired AE related to angiotensin-converting enzymes
inhibitors (ACEi-AAE) and AAE with Cl-inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-AAE) [5]. In this way, a large survey
involving 1056 patients in a tertiary reference centre identified 57% of patients diagnosed as bradykinin-mediated AE
and 36% as idiopathic histaminergic acquired-AE (IHAAE) [6]. The prevalence of IH-AAE may be even much
higher in the general population, and probably the most
common form of angioedema without urticaria [5].
Chronic urticaria and IH-AAE are thought to belong to
the same clinical entity [5]. During the evolution of CU,
50% of patients exhibit both wheals and angioedema, and

The clinical characteristics of IH-AAE have been
described as similar to those of chronic urticaria; however,
the publications relating the features of this form of angioedema are lacking and the current data originate from discussions among experts [5].

Hence, the purpose of this study is to establish the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients suffering
from IH-AAE.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients seen at
our tertiary-level centre. During 2014-15, 534 patients
were referred to our national reference centre for angioedema and/or urticaria. Among them, 31 presented angioedema without wheals. We then identified patients with
angioedema who improved with anti-histamines. Medical
history was obtained during specialized consultations at
our centre. The data collected were: frequency, duration
and site of the attacks, age at onset, history of allergy, use
of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)
and/or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). The AE characteristics reported in this study (location, duration) were
those of the last AE attack and of all previous episodes
before the first consultation at our centre. A complete physical examination was carried out for every patient.

The clinical criteria to make the diagnosis of IH-AAE
were the ones proposed previously (Table 1) [5,7]. The
response to anti-histamines was defined as a 50% reduction
in the frequency of attacks. This criterion was considered as
a confirmation yardstick and necessary for the diagnosis of
IH-AAE in this study. A trial of up to a fourfold dose of
second-generation H-1 anti-histamines was carried out for
each patient. The efficacy assessment of the background
treatment was made in systematic follow-up consultations.

When data were available on previous treatments of
acute episodes, the efficacy criterion was an onset of symptom relief within 2 h.

We assayed serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
levels, D-dimers levels, protein concentrations of Clinhibitor antigen, C4 and Clq by radial immunodiffusion.
Cl-inhibitor activity was measured with the chromogenic
substrate Na-Benzoyl-L-arginine-ethyl-ester-hydrochloride
(BAEe) [8]. Low Cl-inhibitor levels were considered as an
exclusion criteria.

All statistical analyses were performed using spss software
version 20-0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Quantitative
variables were summarized by mean + standard deviation
(s.d.) and compared by the Student’s +test or Mann—Whitney U-test when appropriate. Categorical data were summarized as count (%) and compared by x’ or Fisher’s exact
test when appropriate. Results were considered significant
if the two-tailed P value was less than 0-05.

Results

Population characteristics

Thirty-one patients were referred to our centre for AE
without wheals and met the criteria for IH-AAE: 15 men
and 16 women, with a mean age of 50 years (Table 2). The
mean age at diagnosis was 50 years and the average time to
diagnosis was 6:3 years.

Twenty-three per cent of these patients had hypertension, and 12-9% had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.
Five patients were receiving treatment with angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and three with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). A previous diagnosis of
either ACEi or ARB-induced bradykinin-mediated AE was
reported in each of these eight cases. All patients receiving
ACEi or ARB mentioned previous episodes of AE attacks
before initiation of these treatments and no worsening of
symptoms were reported afterwards. None of the diabetic
patients had been prescribed gliptins, but three of them
were receiving ARB. Twelve patients had a history of allergy
(38-7%), nine suffering from allergic rhinitis and four from
anaphylaxis to food allergens, drugs or wasp venom. The
comorbidities recorded are shown in Table 2.

Eleven patients (35-4%) had a history of at least one episode of wheals before the period of AE attacks [median

time of 6 years (1-42) before the first AE attack]. Two
patients experienced episodes of wheals after diagnosis (8
months and 2 years after diagnosis).

Biological characteristics

All patients had normal C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH)
activity. Serum TSH levels were measured in 21 patients.
This assay was within the normal range in 20 patients. One
patient exhibited a low serum TSH level, related to the
presence of anti-thyroperoxydase antibodies. Eight patients
were assayed for serum D-dimer levels, two of whom presented concentrations above the normal range. In all cases,
serum tryptase levels were within the normal range (mean
serum tryptase 3-84 j1g/l + 1-91).

Location and characteristics of attacks

The face was the most frequent location of AE attacks,
found in 80-6% of patients. Fifty-four per cent of patients
had presented at least one attack in the upper respiratory
tract, including oral mucosa (17 patients). A lingual location was found in 29% of cases and a laryngeal location in
3% (one patient).

Men were more likely to have an upper airway involvement (80%) than women (31-2%, P = 0-011). A peripheral
involvement was noted in 35-4% of patients (11 patients)
and 16% (five patients) presented swellings at the level of
external genital organs. No deaths were recorded. The

mean duration of attacks was 28-1 h (+ 21.0) and the
median was 24 h (Table 3). The mean frequency of attacks
before diagnosis was 39-8/year (+ 66-8), and the median
24/year.

Risk factors and factors precipitating attacks

In 41-9% of cases (13 patients), a factor facilitating the
occurrence of AE attacks was identified. These factors were
as follows: drugs for nine patients (morphine derivatives
for one patient, antibiotic treatment for two patients and

Management of the attack

During the last acute episode [before, 48% of patients (17
patients)] were referred to emergency departments.
Patients referred to an emergency room had an upper airway involvement in 73-3% of cases (11 of 15 patients) versus 37:5% (six of 10) in patients who were not. This
difference was not statistically significant (P = 0-073). Data
on the treatment modalities were available for 21 patients:
three patients were treated with anti-histamines, seven with
corticosteroids and 10 with an association of corticosteroids and anti-histamines. Anti-histamines were efficient in
100% of cases, corticosteroids in no cases and the association in 60% of patients.

One patient was treated with the bradykinin receptor
antagonist icatibant with no improvement. Efficacy data
are shown in Table 4.

Dosage of H1-anti-histamine to achieve the clinical
response

All patients were prescribed a continuous anti-histamine
treatment. The dosage of anti-histamines to prevent subsequent attacks was onefold the recommended dose in 51-6%
of patients (16 patients), twofold in 32% (10 patients),
threefold in two patients and fourfold in three patients.
There were no statistical differences in terms of frequency or
location of attacks between patients treated with a high dose
(three—fourfold) and a standard dose of anti-histamines.

Discussion

IH-AAE is thought to be the main form of angioedema
without wheals [5]. This is not surprising, as approximately
10-20% of the population will one day experience an episode of urticaria [4], and given that 10% of these patients
present AE without wheals [2,4,6]. Indeed, it has been sug
gested that chronic urticaria and IH-AAE belong to the
same clinical entity [5]. Surprisingly, before this study
no data were available relating to the epidemiological
and clinical characteristics of the patients suffering from
H-AAE. Some differences with CU may be highlighted.
In this series the sex ratio was balanced (15 men and 16
women), whereas in patients suffering from CU a female
preponderance is commonly described, with an average
female to male ratio of 2 : 1 [9]. The mean age of the
first attack was 43-8 years, as described previously in
epidemiological studies on CU (average age 40 years)
10]. The apparently high rate of diabetic patients in
this case series (12-9%) probably reflects the higher
prevalence in this age group (average age of 50 years).
nterestingly, the AE attacks were located frequently in
the upper airway (54-8% of patients reported such a
location) including one patient with a laryngeal location.
Despite the threatening presentation of these patients no
fatalities occurred, and all patients recovered without
requiring admission to an intensive care unit. To our
nowledge, unlike in patients with bradykinin-mediated
AE, no deaths have ever been reported in patients suffering from CU with upper airway involvement.

The main differential diagnosis of IH-AAE is
bradykinin-mediated AE. During the acute phase, no
clinical characteristics may help to differentiate between
the two entities. Short duration of attacks (a few hours)
would argue in favour of IH-AAE [11]. In this series,
however, the median duration of symptoms was 24 h,
still consistent with the diagnosis of bradykininmediated AE. A history of spontaneous urticaria separately from the current episode of AE would be an
argument in favour of IH-AAE. In this work, however,
58% of patients had not experienced any episode of
urticaria before diagnosis.

Five patients were on treatment with ACEi and three
with ARB, leading initially to the wrong diagnosis of ARB
or ACEi-induced bradykinin-mediated AE (ACEi-AE). In
this series one patient was prescribed the bradykinin receptor antagonist icatibant. This probably reflects the difficulty
for clinicians to make the diagnosis of histaminergic-AE in
certain situations. Thus, a suspicion of ACEi-AE may lead
correctly to the prescription of specific treatments for
bradykinin-mediated AE, because of the potential severity
of this type of AE.

With regard to the background treatment, this series
supports the benefit of a higher dosage of anti-histamines
in some patients to achieve the clinical response [12-14].
Indeed, prescribing anti-histamines up to fourfold has
been shown to improve chronic urticaria symptoms without increasing side effects such as somnolence in approximately three-quarters of patients [14]. Astonishingly,
during the acute episode, treatment with corticosteroids
alone was not efficient in seven patients and the association
of corticosteroids and anti-histamines seemed less efficient

than anti-histamines alone. According to our experience,
the lack of response to this association is unusual. It must
be emphasized that the low number of patients (only three
patients treated with anti-histamines alone) and the retrospective nature of this study do not allow any conclusion
regarding treatment efficacy. For acute exacerbations, antihistamines and a short course of corticosteroids may
indeed be considered, as recommended in patients with
CSU [7]. However, given that corticosteroids might have
no effect for 4-6 h, their usefulness during the acute phase
needs to be clarified, and placebo-controlled studies are still
lacking [15,16]. For long-term prophylaxis, corticosteroids
are not recommended in patients with CSU, due to obligatory side effects and to the risk of development of severe
anti-histamine-resistant forms of the disease [7,17]. We
suggest that the same therapeutic approach may be beneficial for IH-AAE, given the similarity of these diseases.

The diagnosis criteria used in this study were those published previously [5]. Given the important prevalence of IHAAE among patients presenting with recurrent AE, we suggest
that an empirical treatment with anti-histamines could be
used as a diagnostic test. However, as in patients with CU, one
can assume that some mast cell-mediated AE may be resistant
to anti-histamines, requiring third-line therapies such as omalizumab or cyclosporin [7]. By definition, using the current
criteria of IH-AAE, anti-histamine-resistant mast cellmediated AE were excluded from this study. Thus, the patients
suffering from the most resistant forms of the disease are not
described in this series. However, according to our experience,
resistance to anti-histamines in histamine-mediated AE
patients remains exceptional.

Other limits of this study are inherent in its retrospective
nature, in particular recall bias regarding previous episodes
of wheals and/or AE and their treatments. Prospective studies would be necessary to confirm the data presented here.

Conclusion

IH-AAE is a common cause of recurrent AE without
wheals. This form of AE remains often unrecognized and
an important delay in diagnosis is observed. The diagnostic
approach is exclusively clinical. An upper airway involvement occurred in half of patients, with a benign course in
all cases. A background therapy with an increased dosage
up to fourfold of second-generation anti-histamines may
be required to control the symptoms.
