Introdwetion
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is the most common subtype of urticaria, and is
characterized by recurrent episodes of spontaneous wheals and/or angioedema with unknown

triggers, lasting for more than six weeks.’ CSU generally affects 0.5—1.0% of people 20-40
years of age, with a disease duration of 1-5 years.” Patients with CSU often experience sleep
deprivation and psychiatric comorbidities like anxiety and depression, which compromise the
health-related and overall quality of life of the affected individuals.” ?

Treatment of CSU can be challenging in most cases as it is often difficult to identify,the
underlying cause of the disease, and symptomatic therapies remain mainstay oftreatment in
these patients. First-line treatment of CSU includes second-generation nonssedating
antihistamines.’ “* However, the licensed doses of these drugs reliéve symptoms in only
50% of cases, and the current guidelines suggest updosing of Hi-antihistamines up to
fourfold. ' Both clinical experience and clinical studies support this approach showing a
higher efficacy in many, but not all, patients.° Patients refractory to antihistamine therapy are
generally treated with up to four times the recommended dose of second-generation

antihistamines plus omalizumab, or cycl6Sporine’A in severe cases.!"*

Omalizumab is a recombinant anti-IgE antibody approved for the treatment of CSU
refractory to antihistamines.” * Itisdministered subcutaneously at the recommended doses
of 150 or 300 mg evety 4 weeks. °“The mechanism of action is still unclear, although
omalizumab seems o block the binding of IgE to the FceRI receptor on the surface of target
cells, including mast cells and basophils, thus reducing receptor expression and the release of

inflammatory/mediators””.

Since predictors of response to omalizumab treatment in CSU patients are still unclear, this

study aims to evaluate efficacy and safety of this drug in patients with H1 antihistaminerefractory CSU, investigating also baseline factors influencing treatment outcome as well as

time lag to response to omalizumab by serum auto-reactivity.

Methods

Study design and patients

This multicentric retrospective observational study involved 23 Italian allérgy and clinical
immunology secondary care centers. The study comprised a 4—week pre-treatment period,
followed by a 24—week treatment period, and a 16-week follow-up*period. Patients aged 1285 years included in the study had a history of spontaneous,urticaria for more than 6 weeks,
not responding to treatment with licensed doses of non-sedating second-generation H1antihistamines for at least four weeks, with adailysirticaria activity score (UAS) =4 assessed
in clinic on one of the pre-treatment check®up\days (days —14, —7, or 1), and a 7-day urticaria
activity score (UAS7) >16 assessed during 7 days before first study treatment. Baseline
autologous serum skin test (ASST) was performed as per standard guidelines. ASST was
considered to be positive. ifthe wheal induced by serum was > 1.5 mm larger in diameter than
that induced by saline.'®.The total IgE serum levels were also measured using
immunofluorometricyassay (ImmunoCAP; ThermoFisher, Uppsala, Sweden) and were
expresséd in KUA/L, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

The key,exclusion criteria were as follows: patients with serious psychological disturbances;
history of malignancy or hypersensitivity to omalizumab; or treatment with omalizumab
within the previous six months.

All procedures complied with the Helsinki Declaration of 1964, subsequently revised in
2013. The study protocol was approved by the ethical committee of Naples University
Hospital, Italy. Informed consent was obtained from all patients who agreed to participate to
this study.

According to the recommendations of the Italian Drug Agency (AIFA) for CSU, omalizumab
was administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks at doses of 300 mg for 24 weeks/in total
(first treatment course) and was administered again (second treatment cotise) atleast 8
weeks after the end of the first treatment course if the UAS7 score Showed values similar to
those at pretreatment. u

Throughout the study period, patients were required to maintain) stable doses of their pretreatment therapy with H1 antihistamines at approved doses. During this time, patients were
therefore allowed to use up to four times of the licensed dose of H1 antihistamines and/or
systemic glucocorticoids, as needed, for‘symptomatic relief.

Study end points and statistical analysis

The primary efficacy end points included mean and median change in UAS7 score, weekly
itch severity score (ISS)‘andthive score from baseline to respective values at weeks 4, 12, and
24. The t-test wasémployed for comparison of means.

Secondary efficacy outcomes included the proportion of patients with well-controlled
urticaria (UAS7<6) and complete response to omalizumab treatment (UAS7=0) at week 4,
12, 24pand 40. Safety was evaluated by monitoring and recording the frequency and severity
of adverse events (AEs).

Various factors were then investigated as predictors of response to omalizumab treatment,

contrasting patients with UAS7 score of >6 (non-responders'”) to those with UAS7 <6
(responders'”) at week 24. Logistic regression analysis was employed to investigate treatment
response as binary endpoint (UAS7 >6 vs. UAS7 <6) by different baseline characteristics.
Total level of pre-treatment IgE were categorized into quartiles. A multivariate logistic
regression model was fitted by selecting factors significant at the univariate analysis, The
results of the multivariable logistic regression model, expressed as odds ratio(QR) with 95%
confidence interval (95% CI), were also adjusted for the effect of participating centers.
Patients responding within 8 days since omalizumab administration were considered “fast
responders’, those responding between 8 days and 6 months were*¢onsidered “s/ow
responders”.'°

The speed of response to omalizumab (fast responders vs. Slow responders) was tested
against serum reactivity based on ASST results (poSitive vs. negative) in an univariable exact
logistic regression analysis. Results were 6xpressed as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence
interval (95%CI).

Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 14.2 package (Stata Corporation, College
Station, Texas, USA). Leveltof significance was set at <0.05. Missing values were excluded
and complete case“analysis was performed.

Results

The study was conducted at 23 allergy and clinical immunology secondary care centers in
Italyall.of which were members of the Italian Society of Allergy, Asthma and Clinical
Immunology task force. A total of 322 patients with refractory CSU who received at least one
dose of omalizumab at the study centers from September 2015 to August 2017 were included

in the study, and were examined by 56 different physicians.
 

The mean age of patients was 46.5 + 14.3 years, 222 patients (68.9%) were female and the

 

mean total IgE at baseline was 231.4 + 506.6 KUA/L (Table I). Mean duration of CSU was

 

44.1 + 64.3 months and 167 patients (53.2%) had history of angioedema. The mean baseline

UAS7 score was 27.9 + 8.3 and in-clinic UAS was 4.8 + 0.8; the baseline hive score.was 13.3

 

 

+ 5.2, whereas baseline ISS was 14.4 + 4.7. Angioedema was reported by 111°@6.3%)

 

 

patients in the week before treatment.

Efficacy

As it can be seen from Table I, UAS7 scores diminished fromebaseline to week 4 (mean
change =—19.5), up to week 12 (mean change = —22.7),and week 24 (mean change = —24.6),
with a significant decreasing trend over time (p-trend\<0.001). Similar mitigated trends from
baseline to week 4, 12 and 24 were also observed\for mean values of weekly hive scores (ptrend <0.001) as well as ISS (p-trend <0°008).

Nineteen patients (5.9%) discontinted the study during the 24-week treatment period; 12
patients had disease progression,three had personal problems, two had AEs, and two were
lost to follow-up. Eleven patients (3.4%) discontinued treatment between week 24 and week
40 and were lost to“follow-up.

During the follow-up»period, 119/292 (40.8%) patients repeated treatment with omalizumab
(second/treatment course) due to an increase in the mean UAS7 score. At the end of the
studymh73/292 (59.2%) patients did not repeat omalizumab treatment.

At the end of the 40-week study, 107 out of 173 patients (61.8%) reported well-controlled
urticaria (UAS7 score <6), and complete response to omalizumab treatment (UAS7 score=0)

was observed in 75 out of 173 treated patients (43.4%) (Table II).
Based on the above, factors significantly associated with UAS7 score >6 after 24 weeks since
treatment start with omalizumab at univariable analysis were baseline angioedema,
cyclosporine use, angioedema history, IgE levels and (to some extent) duration of CSU
(Table II). At multivariate analysis only higher pre-treatment IgE values — categories (48119) KUA/L and (120-236) KUA/L — were significantly less likely to be associated with a
UAS7 score >6 at the end of the 24-week treatment period (Table II).

ASST was performed on 160 patients only. The results of ASST performed on the 135
patients who responded to omalizumab treatment (out of 255 responders) were analyzed.
Sixty-six patients responding within 8 days of omalizumab,administration were categorized
as “fast responders”, the remaining 69 patients were classed as “s/ow responders”. Nineteen
out of the 66 (28.8%) “fast responders” were ASST positive compared with 44 of the 69
(63.8%) “slow responders” (P <0.001) (fable\IV). ASST-positive patients were 4.30 times
more likely to have a slow respons€ to omalizumab treatment as compared with ASSTnegative patients.

Safety

The overall incidence of. AEs during the 24-week treatment phase was 11.2%, and 31 patients
(9.6%) reported at least one AE. Migraine, asthenia and administration site conditions were
the most common AEs (Table V). No treatment-emergent AEs were reported during the
study?

Discussion

The results of this study showed that omalizumab effectively reduced the symptoms of CSU

in antihistamine refractory patients. After 24 weeks of treatment, omalizumab significantly
10

decreased the mean UAS7, ISS and weekly hive scores. Furthermore, 84.2% of patients
reported well-controlled urticaria at the end of the 24-week treatment period, and complete
response to treatment was seen in 66.7% of patients. Overall, the treatment was well
tolerated.

UAS7 is a validated and widely used patient-reported measure of CSU that captures the
intensity of pruritus and number of hives.“ Studies with omalizumab havé reported a
reduction in UAS7 scores with treatment in patients with CSU.'*'*A randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled study of omalizumab in patients withhGSU, reported that treatment
with omalizumab decreased the UAS7 scores during the‘24-week treatment period.'* Another
prospective open-label study with omalizumab reported a reduction in the UAS7 scores from
baseline (5.7 vs 32.2) with treatment.'° The results of the present study are in line with these
reports and show that omalizumab treatmeént,effectively reduced the UAS7 scores in patients
with CSU over the 24-week treatment period, thus improving the overall symptoms in these
patients.

Currently, the predictors.of response to omalizumab treatment in CSU are not well known. A
study by Ghazanfaf-and colleagues reported that favorable response to omalizumab treatment
can be predieted by the presence of CSU, no angioedema, negative histamine release test,
older age, shorter duration of symptoms, and no history of treatment with systemic
immtnosuppressant drugs.'’ Another prospective study with omalizumab reported that
patients with lower baseline IgE values showed poor response to treatment and that the ratio
of IgE values after treatment to baseline IgE levels of patients can help in predicting the

treatment response in patients with CSU.'* Similarly the present study confirmed poor
11

treatment outcome in relation of some baseline characteristics as cyclosporine administration,
presence of angioedema, longer duration of CSU symptoms and low level of IgE. The above
results are in line with previous reports identifying markers of response to omalizumab
treatment in patients with CSU, which may be of significant value in clinical settings.
However, after controlling for the simultaneous effect of all factors, the only important
predictor of efficacious treatment response in our study was higher levels of prestreatment
IgE.

ASST is a simple in vivo clinical test for the detection of basophilshistamine-releasing
activity. ASST has a sensitivity of approximately 70% anda specificity of 80%, and it may
be used as a reasonably predictive clinical test to indicate the presence of functional
circulating anti-FceRIa and anti IgE autoantibodies "Ybut it can cause false positive results,
because of the formation of a large amountof bradykinin and secretion of tryptases from

neutrophils during the coagulatio/process’”.

Our study also showed that patients who were ASST positive were less likely to be “fast
responders” (i.e. response within 8 days of omalizumab administration) to omalizumab
treatment than those who were ASST negative. This result confirms the findings of Gericke
et al. whonalso identified a significant association between ASST positivity and slower time
lag to symptom relief with omalizumab in CSU patients'’, suggesting that omalizumab

reduced the number of FceRI receptors on mast cells and basophils in these patients.

Treatment with omalizumab was well tolerated in the present study. The most common AEs

were migraine, asthenia and administration site conditions, which were not related to
12

omalizumab treatment. The main limitation of this study is its design, being observational
and retrospective, without controls. In addition, although current guidelines for the diagnosis
of CSU still recommend the in vivo ASST to define a CSU subgroup as having autoreactive
urticaria,’ concerns have been raised regarding its interpretation and specificity '°,

In conclusion, omalizumab was well tolerated and effective in the treatment ofipatients with
CSU refractory to second-generation non-sedating antihistamines. Monitoring the baseline
characteristics of patients before introduction of omalizumab therapy may help to predict

treatment outcome in CSU patients.
