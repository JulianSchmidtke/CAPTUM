Abstract

BACKGROUND® Autoimmune processes are considered to play a major role in the
pathogenesis of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). Very recently, interleukin 24 (IL-24) has
been identifiedeas'an IgE-autoantigen in CSU. Some studies revealed that notably autologous
serum skin *test(ASST)-positive CSU patients may benefit from autohemotherapy, however,

the mechanisms of action remain unknown.

We aimed tosinvestigate the immunological effects of autologous serum injections in ASST
positive CSUspatients

METHODS 66~.ASST-positive CSU patients were treated with weekly intramuscular
autologous*serum injections for 8 weeks and followed up for 12 weeks. Urticaria Activity
Score (UAS7) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) were assessed. The ASST was done
at baseline, week 9 and week 21. Serum samples (baseline, week 9, 13 and/or 21) were
analysed for the\levels of IgE-anti-IL-24 and IgG-anti-IL-24 via ELISA and their ability to

release histamine in basophils (BHRA).

RESULTS Autologous serum therapy resulted in a substantial improvement in disease activity
and quality ofslife after 8 and 20 weeks. 28% and 34% of patients turned ASST-negative in
week 9 and 21, respectively, but there was no link between their response to treatment and
changes of ASST results. Also, no significant or relevant changes in BHRA were observed. In
contrastgautologous serum therapy significantly decreased IgE-anti-IL-24 serum levels, but

not IgG-anti-IL-24 serum levels, in responders but not in non-responders.

CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that the immunological effects of autologous serum
therapy include a reduction in IgE-anti-IL24 autoantibodies, which may contribute to the

pathogenesis of CSU.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common skin disease characterized by the
spontaneous occurrence of itching and short-lived wheals, angioedema or both for longer
than 6 weeks*2. The pathomechanisms of CSU have been studied for decades, but remain
not fully understood. Nowadays, two types of autoimmune mechanisms are held to be
relevant inmmany cases of CSU: Type | autoimmunity (also called autoallergy) with IgE
autoantibodiés to autoantigens and Type IIb autoimmunity with IgG autoantibodies to IgE or
its high affinitymeceptor, FceRI?->. The autologous serum skin test (ASST) is used as a

nonspecific screening test to evaluate the presence of histamine-releasing factors in serum.

As stated in the EAACI/GA?LEN/EDF/WAO guideline for urticariat, modern non-sedating

antihistamines are the first-line treatment. If symptoms persist, up dosing to the four-fold

dose is recommended. For antihistamine-resistant patients, omalizumab, a humanized antiIgE antibody and, if ineffective, ciclosporin A are recommended treatment options?®.
However, In some countries, such as China, Germany, India, Iran, South Korea, Turkey,
Mexico and the USA, autohemotherapy is also commonly used to treat antihistamineresistant patients with CSU’. As of now, the level of evidence in support of the efficacy of
autohemotherapy in the treatment of patients with CSU is limited and the mechanisms of
action are currently not well understood, which is why autohemotherapy as a treatment

approach in GSU.is controversially discussed+3. (Supplemental Material)

Interleukin 24 (IL¢24) is a member of the interleukin 10 family of cytokines. In humans, IL-24
is expressed in the skin and immune system, including the thymus, spleen and peripheral
blood leukocytes. Very recently, IL-24 was identified as a common, specific and functional

autoantigen of IgE autoantibodies in CSU**.

Our study ‘aimed to investigate the immunological effects and potential mechanisms of
action of autologous serum injections in CSU patients. We analyzed serum reactivity before
and after eight.weeks of autohemotherapy by autologous serum skin testing and basophil
histamine-release assay. We also monitored the levels of IgE (and IgG) against IL-24. To
assess changes®in serum autoreactivity and IgE-anti-IL-24 levels for their clinical relevance,
we correlated them with changes in clinical outcome measures, i.e. the weekly urticaria
activity scone (UAS7), the on demand use of antihistamines, and quality of life impairment
(DLQI).

Methods

Patients and’autohemotherapy protocol

ASST-positive patients (n=66, 18 years old or older) with CSU (duration > 6 weeks, UAS7 > 7
at baseline) were treated with autologous serum injections (Supplemental Material) at the
GA?LEN Urticaria Centers of Reference and Excellence? in Berlin, Germany (n=21) and
Istanbul, Turkeys(A=33) as well as the Nashik Urticaria Clinic, India (n=12). The analyses of all
available treatment outcomes, diaries, questionnaires and blood samples were approved by
the ethics committee of the coordinating center of this study, the Department of

Dermatology and Allergy at Charité — Universitatsmedizin Berlin.

Assessment of disease activity and impact

This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved
Disease activity was assessed by the UAS7. The use of on demand antihistamines (AHdemand) was documented and served as a surrogate marker for disease activity and burden
of disease. Disease impact on quality of life was assessed with the Dermatology Life Quality
Index (DLQI). UAS7 scores, AH-demand data and DLQI values were obtained by use of

patient diary documentation (Supplemental Table).

Calculation of UAS7

Disease activity.was assessed by the UAS, a validated and widely accepted disease activity
tool as recommended by the international urticaria guideline?” ®. The weekly UAS (UAS7,
range 0-42) was calculated as sum of the daily values over 7 days.

Responses to. autohemotherapy treatment were defined by the reduction of UAS7 compared
to week 0.™€6ifiplete Response” (CR) was defined as a reduction of UAS7 equal or more
than 90%, “Paftial Response” (PR) as a reduction between 90%-30% and “Non Response”
(NR) as equal or less than 30% reduction in UAS7!”. The minimal important difference (MID)
is the smallest change that can be considered to be clinically relevant. A change in the score
that is equal.to.or greater than 11 points has been estimated for the UAS7 in patients with

csu.

Calculation of on-demand use of antihistamines

A history of, beneficial effects of antihistaminic treatment was part of the inclusion criteria.
The use of antihistamines was restricted to on-demand intake (AH-demand) during weeks 08, 12, and 20. At.all other times, patients were free to take antihistamines as on-demand or
as prophylaxis™@é@tirizine was recommended for treatment, however, patients could decide
to use other®non'sedating antihistamines according to their preference. The weekly AHdemand score was calculated as the sum of all antihistamine tablets (one point per tablet)

used per week.

Calculatiomof DLQI

The DLQI consists of 10 questions across six domains: symptoms/feelings, daily activities,
leisure, work/school, personal relationships and treatment?®. Each answer is scored from
‘very much’ (3) to ‘not at all’ (0), and an overall score (0-30) is calculated by summing the

individual domain scores. Higher scores indicate higher impairment of quality of life.

The DLQI was applied in weeks 1, 9, 13, and 21 (Supplemental Table). A minimal clinically
important difference (MCID) of 3-4 points has been estimated for the DLQI in patients with
CcSU19. The MCID is the minimum change considered important by the patient and
mandating a change in management. The proportion of patients whose change in DLQI from

baseline reached an MCID of = 4 was assessed at week 9, 13, and 21.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis'of the data was performed using the software GraphPad Prism 6.0 and
IBM SPSS*Statisties 23. Data were analysed by calculating values for the mean and standard
deviation (=SD). Paired and categorical data (e.g. data from the same patients obtained at
different time points) were compared using the McNemar test. In the statistical tests, a p
value < 0.05 wassconsidered as statistically significant.

Autohemotherapy significantly reduced the mean + SD CSU disease activity as assessed by
UAS7 from 23.3 + 8.1 before treatment to 14.8 + 11.3 at the end of the 8-week treatment
period (-36 %, p < 0.0001). Disease activity was first significantly reduced, to 17.9 + 10.3,
after 2 weeks of treatment (-23 %, p < 0.001). UAS7 values continued to decrease after the
end of treatment, to 12.8 + 10.7 (-45 %, p < 0.0001) and 12.6 + 12.4 (-46 %, p < 0.0001) at

week 12 and 20, respectively (Figure 1a+b+c+d).

The use Of"6n"démand antihistamines was significantly decreased in week 8 of treatment
(from 2.9 +'3-9°'t6"1.5 + 3.0 tablets per week, p < 0.05) and continued to decrease thereafter,
to 1.4 + 3.1 tablets per week (p < 0.01, in week 20). Quality of life was significantly improved
from 8.8 + 657 (atbaseline) to 6.3 + 6.1 (at week 9, p < 0.05), 6.0 + 6.7 (at week13, p < 0.01)
and 5.1 + 6.4 (at week 21, p < 0.001) after the start of treatment as assessed by the DLQI
(Figure 1le+f). Furthermore, UAS7 in week 0, 8, 12 and 20 showed correlation with DLQI in
week 1, 9, 13 and 21, respectively (Spearman Test, p = 0.047, 0.0071, 0.0006 and < 0.0001)

At the endsofsthe treatment phase (in week 8), the rate of complete response and partial
response was 13% and 48 %, respectively. At the end of the follow up, in week 20, nearly
two thirds of patients (67.4 %) showed complete or partial response to autologous serum

therapy (Figure2a).

After 8 weeks*of therapy with autologous serum, 35 % (15/43) of patients reached an MCID
of = 4 in total DLQI score compared to baseline. The percentage increased steadily to 42%
(19/45) in week 13 and 48% (20/42) in week 21. However, there was no significant

difference comparing these timepoints (McNemar Test, p > 0.05) (Figure 2b).

In ASST-positive GSU patients receiving treatment with autologous serum, there is no link
between theifechange in disease activity in response to treatment and changes of ASST

results

After 8 weeks of treatment with autologous serum, 28 % (14/50, p < 0.001) of patients
turned ASST-negative. In week 21, the ASST was negative in 34 % (17/50, p < 0.0001) of
patients (Figure 3a). There was no significant difference comparing complete responders
(CRs), partial responders (PRs) and non-responders (NRs) for their rates of patients who
became ASST negative (Chi-square Test, p > 0.05). 40 % (2/5) and 54.5 % (6/11) of CRs, 22.2 %
(4/18) and 30.8 % (4/13) of PRs, and 26.7 % (4/15) and 21.4 % (3/14) of NRs were ASST

negative at week 9 and week 21, respectively (Figure 3b). There was also no significant
difference when comparing patients who became ASST negative with patients who

remained ASST positive for their rates of CR, PR and NR (Figure 3c).

In addition, patients who experienced significant QoL (quality of life) improvement (MCID > 4)
did not shoWedifferent rates of turning ASST-negative than those who did not improve in
their QoL (MCID.< 4), Also, patients who showed a change in their ASST status did not differ
in their ratés"6f’Showing marked QoL improvement as compared to patients who remained

ASST positive.

Serum autoreactivity and its changes during autohemotherapy as assessed by BHRA are not

linked to themesponse to treatment

Before the start of autohemotherapy, 5 of 41 patients were BHRA-positive, and these 5
patients were similar in their treatment responses as compared to BHRA-negative patients.
After 8 weeks.ofpweekly treatment with autologous serum injections, 4 of the 5 BHRApositive remained BHRA-positive, and the one patient who became BHRA-negative was a

non-responder and did not achieve a significant QoL improvement in week 9.

In ASST-positive CSU patients, autohemotherapy reduces serum levels of IgE-anti-IL-24, but

not IgG-anti-IL-24

Therapy with “autologous serum reduced the serum levels of IgE-anti-IL-24 by 18% and 22%,
from 0.24 +.0.02 IU/ml (before treatment) to 0.20 + 0.03 IU/ml (at week 9, p < 0.001) and
0.19 + 0.02sIU/mlig(at week 21, p < 0.001), respectively (Figure 4a). In contrast, serum levels

of IgG-anti-Ik=24edid not change significantly (p > 0.05, Figure 4b).

The reduction of IgE-anti-IL-24 in CSU patients treated with autologous serum is linked to the

response to treatment, but not to changes in ASST status

In complete and partial responders to autohemotherapy, but not in non-responders, the
mean levels of IgE-anti-IL-24 declined significantly from week O to week 9 (p < 0.05) (Figure

5). Moreover, the mean initial IgE-anti-IL-24 levels in complete and partial responders were

higher compared to non-responders. There were no differences in serum levels of IgE-antiIL-24 or IgG-anti-IL-24 in patients who became ASST negative or not at any timepoints after

autohemotherapy (Figure 6).

Discussion

Our study issonesof the first to explore the immunological effects and potential mechanisms
of action of autohemotherapy in patients with CSU. Our findings suggest that autologous
serum therapy has rapid, strong, and sustained beneficial clinical effects in ASST-positive CSU
patients that are linked to the presence and changes of autoantibodies. Most importantly,
high levels ‘of/IgE-anti-IL-24 before treatment and changes of IgE-anti-IL-24 in response to

treatment are linked to the efficacy of autohemotherapy.

In our study@aut6hemotherapy reduced disease activity by 36 % after 8 weekly injections,
lead to sustaih€d"benefit at week 20 (46% reduction), and improved disease activity as early
as after the second injection of autologous serum. Also, the on demand antihistamine
consumption was significantly decreased by more than 50% as compared to baseline. These
results are in lifepwith previous studies. For example, Majid et a/.22 showed a marked decline
of diseaSe=activity after the first few injections of autologous serum. Staubach et al.
reported a persistent treatment effect of autologous whole blood injections in ASST-positive
CSU patients™and reduced disease activity as early as after four weekly treatments as
assessed by the UAS7 and the use of on demand antihistamines. Our findings are also in

agreement with previous studies by Chen et al.23, Godse et al.?4 and Abdallah et al.?9.

CSU is known to have a substantial impact on patients’ quality of life. In our study, quality of
life of our patients was improved after the last autologous serum injection and further
improved thereafter. One third of the patients and almost the half of patients experienced
significant quality of life improvement, i.e. a reduction of the DLQI by the minimal clinically
important difference of 4 points, by the end of the treatment and follow up phase,
respectively. These results confirm the findings of an earlier study by Panchami et al 2°.
Taken together, our results and those of previous studies underline that autohemotherapy
can have rapid, positive and persistent effects on disease activity and impact in patients with

CSU, but they don’t provide an explanation for why this is®:%25-?7.

How does autohemotherapy work in CSU? CSU, in many patients is held to be an
autoimmune disorder, linked to the presence of mast cell-degranulating autoantibodies,
either IgE-autoantibodies directed to autoallergens (type | autoimmunity) or IgG
autoantibodies to the high affinity IgE receptor or IgE itself (type Ilb autoimmunity)*. Our
hypothesis was that autohemotherapy, in patients who benefit from this treatment, reduces
the levels and/or effects of these mast cell-degranulating IgE and IgG autoantibodies. Our
results strongly.suggest that autohemotherapy reduces the levels of IgE autoantibodies, but

not the levels.or.effects of IgG autoantibodies.

Two of our findings independently suggest that autologous serum therapy in CSU does not
work by reducing \the levels or effects of mast cell-degranulating IgG autoantibodies. First,
the ASST, a screening test for these autoantibodies, became negative in only one third of the
treated patients at the end of the follow up phase, and this was not linked to the clinical
response ofspatients. In other words, some patients (4/10 at week 9, 3/13 at week 21)
without clini¢alebenefit became ASST-negative, and some patients (17/28 at week 9, 14/25
at week 21) who had clinical benefit remained ASST-positive. The latter has been described
previously by Mori and Hashimoto2’, who reported CSU remission in a ASST-positive patient
treated with autologous whole blood injections, without changes in the patient’s ASST status.
Second, sthe..BHRA, a more sensitive and specific test than the ASST for mast celldegranulating IgG autoantibodies to the high affinity IgE receptor, became negative in only
one patient,andethis patient was a non responder. We did not have access to direct assays
for measuring the\levels of IgG autoantibodies and their changes in our patients. But even if
we had measured antibody levels and had found a reduction in response to autologous
serum therapy, this would hardly be relevant pathomechanistically, as functional tests such
as the ASSTland.the BHRA remained positive in the majority of patients and changes in the

results of thes@fuinctional tests were not linked to treatment responses.

Our results do.suggest that autohemotherapy works in CSU, at least in part, because of its
effects ‘OfilgE autoantibodies. First, we found that our patients treated with
autohemotherapy showed a significant reduction of their IgE-anti-IL-24 levels after 8 weekly
injections with autologous serum, and their levels continued to drop thereafter. Second, the
drop in IgE-anti-IL-24 was only significant in responders, but not non responders to

autohemotherapy although statistical comparisons in the analysis are based on small patient

numbers in each response group. Taken together, these findings support the idea that IgEautoantibodies such as IgE-anti-IL-24 are one of the targets of the mechanisms of action of
autohemotherapy in CSU. It would be interesting to extend analyses of autoreactive IgE to
other autoallergens that have been described to be relevant targets of IgE in patients with

CSU such as thyroperoxidase, tissue factor as well as dsDNA?93°,

Our study 'has®several important strengths and limitations, and it points to interesting
questions that need to be addressed by further studies. The limitations of our study include
its uncontrolled.design and relatively small sample size. In retrospect, we should not have
limited inclusionginto the study to ASST-positive patients. ASST positivity of our patient
population/ for sure, has biased our study group towards type Ilb autoimmune CSU and
against type | autoimmune CSU, in which autohemotherapy now has to be expected to be
more effective than in type IIb autoimmune CSU. For sure, additional studies are required to
investigate theseffect of autohemotherapy in ASST-negative patients and to explore the role
in type | autoimmunity. This is especially true, since our studies of IgE-anti-IL24 serum levels
were only performed on 15 of the patients included in this study, due to limited volumes of
sera available. On the plus side, our patient population was fairly homogeneous, our study
was a multicenter study, and our key outcomes included major pathogenic drivers of type |
and typeailb.autoimmune CSU. Further studies are needed to better characterize the
relevance and mechanisms of these effects of autohemotherapy. Are there any other
functional lgExautoantibodies against autoantigens in autologous serum therapy? How is IgEanti-IL-24 reduced, by autohemotherapy, by effects on its production, its clearance, or both?
Are other IgE autoantibodies and levels of total IgE also reduced by autohemotherapy in CSU
patients, ASST-positive and ASST-negative patients? Are total IgE levels affected by

autohemotherapy?

In summary, our\study demonstrates that autohemotherapy can lead to clinical benefit in
part by its effects.on levels of IgE autoantibodies in ASST-positive CSU patients. This supports
the notidn.that specific and functional IgE autoantibodies contribute to the pathogenesis of
CSU and suggests that these IgE autoantibodies represent a potential therapeutic target of

autohemotherapy.

Figure 1. Autologous serum therapy results in rapid, marked and sustained improvement

in ASST-positive patients with CSU

Effects of autologous serum therapy on disease activity (a, b, c), change of MID (d), use of on
demand antihistamine medication (e) and quality of life impairment (f) in patients with
chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and a positive ASST. UAS7, on demand antihistamine
use, and DLQLare shown for each patient and displayed as mean and standard deviation (SD).
* p < 0.05, **"p"S"0.01, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001 (Wilcoxon Test) compared to week 0.
N = 46, 46, 46°46, 49, and 33 for a, b, c, d, e and f.

Figure 2. CSU patients treated with autologous serum therapy show high rates of

responses and:clinically important quality of life improvement

a) Distribution of patients with complete, partial and non response to treatment with
autologous serum during the treatment phase (week 1-8) and the follow-up period (week 12
and week 20),.Complete response = a reduction of UAS7 equal or more than 90 % compared
to week 0. Partial response = a reduction of UAS7 between 90 %-30 % compared to week 0.

Non response = a reduction of UAS7 equal or less than 30 % compared to week 0. N = 46.

b) Rates ofspatients who reached or did not reach MCID 2 4 in DLQI after autologous serum
therapy No significant difference was observed by McNemar Test (p > 0.05). MCID = Minimal

clinically important difference. N = 43, 45 and 42, respectively.

Figure 3. In ASST=positive CSU patients receiving treatment with autologous serum, there
is no linksbetween their response to treatment and changes of ASST results.

Comparison of changes in ASST (a) and proportions of ASST positive and negative patients in
complete, partialland non responders at week 9 and 21 (b and c). At baseline (week 0), all
patients were ASST-positive. *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001 (McNemar Test). ASST +/- =
Autologous.Serum Test Positive/ Negative. CR = Complete response, PR = Partial response,

NR = Non response. N = 50, 38 and 38 in Figure 3a, 3b and 3c respectively.

Figure 4. In ASST-positive CSU patients, autologous serum therapy reduces serum levels of

IgE-anti-IL-24, but not IgG-anti-IL-24

Comparison of IgE-anti-IL-24 and IgG-anti-IL-24 serum levels before and after treatment with
autologous serum. Data shown are from all patients with available data at the specific time
points. The serum levels of IgE-anti-IL-24 (a) and IgG-anti-IL-24 (b) were measured via ELISA.
Data are displayed as mean and standard deviation (SD). ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001

(Wilcoxon Test); IL-24 = Interleukin 24. N = 15;

Figure 5. The reduction of IgE-anti-IL-24 in CSU patients treated with autologous serum is

linked to the,response to treatment

Comparison OfslgE-anti-IL-24 and IgG-anti-IL-24 serum levels in different response groups
before and after treatment. Data are displayed as mean and standard deviation (SD). Data
shown aresfromeall patients with available data at the specific time points. Statistical
comparisonsmwere done only for paired data available at baseline (week 0) and post
treatment (week 9 or week 21). * P < 0.05(Wilcoxon Test). N= 13,9,9 for 5a, 5c and 7,5,4 for

5b, 5d, respectively.

Figure 6. Thesreduction of IgE-anti-IL-24 in CSU patients treated with autologous serum is

not linked:to’ changes in ASST status.

Comparison of IgE-anti-IL-24 and IgG-anti-IL-24 serum levels patients who become ASST
negative with®patients who remain ASST positive after treatment. Data shown are from all
patients with available data at the specific time points. Data are tested by Wilcoxon Test and
displayed as mean and standard deviation (SD). N = 6, 10 for 6a, 6c and 14, 25 for 6b, 6d,

respectively,
