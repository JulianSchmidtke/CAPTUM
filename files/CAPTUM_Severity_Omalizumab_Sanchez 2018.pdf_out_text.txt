What is already known about this topic? Considering scientific evidence of the treatment of chronic spontaneous
urticaria in a rational manner, international scientific associations have made certain recommendations that are available
to practitioners as clinical guidelines. However, these recommendations have not been evaluated in a step-by-step

approach.

What does this article add to our knowledge? The sequential evaluation of treatment lines, recommended by urticaria

guidelines, allows a more rational determination of control disease rates for each step and their clinical impact in an
integrated manner.

How does this study impact current management guidelines? These results improve guideline recommendations by
evaluating each line of treatment sequentially: use of H1 antihistamines in conventional doses (first line), up-dosing of
antihistamines (second line), and use of omalizumab or cyclosporine in those with refractory response to H1

antihistamines.

BACKGROUND: International scientific associations have made
recommendations for the management of chronic spontaneous
urticaria (CSU) that have been summarized in clinical
guidelines.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical impact of guideline
recommendations for CSU management.

METHODS: A multicenter, triple-blinded, prospective, randomized study (the Urticaria Research of Tropical Impact and
Control Assessment project; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
NCT01940393) was performed. Patients older than 12 years and
diagnosed with CSU were recruited and treated according to the
European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology/Global
Allergy and Asthma European Network/European Dermatology
Forum/World Allergy Organization guideline recommendations.
The Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI) was assessed
every 2 weeks. As a first line of treatment, patients received a
daily oral dose of antihistamine. After 4 weeks, in those patients

without clinical response (DLQI < 5), a higher dose (up to 4
times) of antihistamine was administered as a second line of
therapy. After 2 months of follow-up, unresponsive patients
received omalizumab or cyclosporine (as add-on therapy) for

4 months as a third line of treatment.

RESULTS: One hundred fifty patients were enrolled. After the
first line of treatment, 88 patients (58.7%) reached a DLQI of
5 or less. With the second line of treatment, disease control rate
was 76.7%. With the third line, 12 patients from the
omalizumab group (8%) and 11 patients from the cyclosporine
group (7.3%) reached a good clinical control (additional 15.3%).
Control rate with line 1 treatment was superior at 1 month than
at 2 weeks (P < .0001).

CONCLUSIONS: The application of these guideline
recommendations for CSU led to a high rate of disease
control, assessed by scoring severity and patients’ perception
of quality of life. These results support the usefulness of
guideline recommendations. © 2017 American Academy of

Urticaria is a group of different clinical conditions and is a
common disease that significantly impacts quality of life.'
Among these conditions, it is estimated that chronic urticaria
affects between 0.5% and 5% of the general population.””
Avoidance of inducers (ie, physical, food, or others) may help
to mitigate the frequency of symptoms in those cases in which a
causal relationship with any of them has been identified; however, in a large number of patients, the symptoms appear
spontaneously without a clear trigger, a clinical condition named

(anti-H1) are the cornerstone in the management of CSU. Some
clinical studies support the usefulness of second-generation antiH1, in a higher dose, to reduce the severity of symptoms in a
proportion of patients without clinical control at a conventional
dose.” When this treatment option is not successful, other
pharmacological options, such as cyclosporine and omalizumab,
are recommended.” '!

Considering scientific evidence of CSU treatment in a rational
manner, international scientific associations have made certain
recommendations that are available to practitioners as clinical
guidelines.”'*'? However, these recommendations derive from
merging independent investigations, which implies the inclusion
of heterogeneous groups of patients and different study designs,
which may bias comparison of therapeutics. To our knowledge,
there are no reports that evaluate, as a sequential approach,
treatment lines proposed in these guidelines. The application of
each line of treatment as a stepwise protocol would allow to
determine the impact of disease control achieved by each of
them.

This study aimed to evaluate, sequentially, current urticaria
guideline recommendations for using anti-H1 in conventional
doses (first-line treatment), up-dosing antihistamines (secondline treatment), and using omalizumab or cyclosporine in those
with refractory response to anti-H1 (third-line treatment).

METHODS

were older than 12 years, with a diagnosis of chronic urticaria
defined as the recurrent of hives, with or without angioedema, on
more than 3 days per week persisting for at least 6 weeks. An allergist
or dermatologist made the diagnosis. Exclusion criteria were systemic
disease presentation that could explain the hives and systemic
steroids usage during the last 3 weeks before recruitment or any

other therapy that could interfere with the evaluation of symptoms.

Quality of life and severity evaluation: Questionnaire
tests

Because the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) was previously validated in Colombia, it was selected among different
questionnaires to assess quality of life. In addition, we used the
Urticaria Activity Score (UAS) and the weekly UAS (UAS7) to

measure the disease severity.

European Network/European Dermatology Forum/World Allergy
Organization guidelines. However, there were differences in the time
of evaluation: the waiting time in the clinical response to antihistamines in the first and second lines was higher than recommended
in the guide. As previously described,’ participants were randomized
(1:1:1:1:1) using Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corp, Redmond,
Wash) to receive 1 of 5 anti-H1 options frequently used in the
2 cities (Bogoté and Medellin). During the first month, participants
received a daily oral dose of cetirizine (10 mg), fexofenadine (180
mg), bilastine (20 mg), desloratadine (5 mg), or ebastine (20 mg).
All anti-H1 medications were supplied in a triple-blinded way every
2 weeks during the first 2 months of follow-up; they were then
supplied monthly in identical capsules. A clinical evaluation was
done every 2 weeks until the end of the follow-up.

After the first month, the anti-H1 dosage was adjusted according
to its clinical effectiveness and adverse reactions. Patients whose
disease was clinically controlled (DLQI < 5) without adverse
reactions continued with the same dose. The dose was increased in
unresponsive patients (DLQI > 5) according to the sedative effect of
the treatment: if the participant reported mild or no sedative adverse
effects with the conventional dose, it was quadrupled, whereas if a
moderate or severe sedative effect was reported, it was doubled.

After 2 months, patients without clinical response with anti-H1
continued with an anti-H1 and were randomized to additionally

 

receive omalizumab 300 mg/mo or cyclosporine 3 mg/kg/
d (100-250 mg) for 4 months. The administration of these drugs

was not blinded because of the difference in administration routes.

Safety and tolerability
Safety and. tolerability were assessed according to the adverse
events reported by participants during each clinical follow-up.

 

Laboratory tests (blood cell count, aspartate aminotransferase,
alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, ureic nitrogen, and electrocardiogram [EKG]) were performed at baseline and then monthly
during follow-up. Sedation was evaluated with a questionnaire test as
was described earlier.’ The sedative effect was considered “strong”
when patients had 3 points in 1 of the 3 questions or 6 to 9 points in
total. When patients were included in the third line of treatment
(omalizumab or cyclosporine), blood pressure was measured weekly
and the aforementioned laboratory tests were performed every
2 weeks.

Ethical considerations

The Ethics Committee of IPS Universitaria Clinics (registry no.
IN13-2013) and the University of Antioquia approved this study
(registry no. BE-IIM 200910). All subjects signed an informed
consent approving their voluntary participation in the study. In
patients younger than 18 years, additional approval was asked from
their legal representative.

Taking into consideration the recommendation of the ethics
committee, we did not include a placebo group, because it would
have provided little information on the primary outcome of the
study and there is consistent evidence supporting the effectiveness of
antihistamines as first-line treatment in patients with urticaria.

Statistical analyses

Most analyses were done using SPSS version 21.0 (SPSS Inc,
Chicago, Ill). The total number and proportions were reported for
categorical data. Frequency rates and their 95% Cls were obtained
using Epidat 3.1 (Xunta de Galicia, PAO/World Health Organization). Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparison of continuous
variables. Differences between proportions were analyzed by Pearson

exposures and outcomes.

RESULTS

A flowchart depicting the progress of subjects through the
study is presented in Figure 1. Clinical and demographic features
of patients involved in the study are presented in Table 1. No
significant differences were found between patients recruited
from the 2 cities. Achievement of disease control during the
6-month follow-up is shown in Figure 2. According to DLQI
results, the general success rate achieved with guideline recommendations was 92% (95% CI, 87.66%-96.34%). The
3 different control levels of the DLQI (none, moderate, and wellcontrolled) are shown in Figure 3. Twelve patients did not
respond to any therapy and no significant predictors (age, sex,
city of residence, onset age of urticaria, atopy, type of anti-H1,
and basal DLQI) of treatment failure were identified (data not
shown). In total, 88 patients (58.7%) were treated with line 1,
27 with line 2 (18%), and 35 with line 3 (23.3%). Rates of
disease control (DLQI) increased gradually with every time point
(P for a trend <.0001).

During the second and subsequent visits, UAS was lower than
3 points in most patients (92.5%) (see Figure E1 in this article’s
Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org). Hence, DLQI
scoring was more sensitive to detect clinical changes during
follow-up. Although the application of UAS7 to grade control
disease was planned, the fact that only 48 patients (32%) kept a
proper record of this questionnaire limited its analysis.

Lines 1 and 2: Antihistamines in conventional and
higher doses

Because anti-H 1-treated patients from the triple randomized
controlled trial had similar control rates, they were considered as
a single group for further analyses (n = 150). Disease control
after 1 month of anti-H1 treatment at a conventional dose was
observed in 88 patients (58.7%; 95% CI, 50.82%-66.58%);

15 days, we tested whether 1 month of treatment could be a
more useful time point. Control rates were higher at 1 month
than at 2 weeks (McNemar test; P < .0001); 34.7% of patients
who did not achieve disease control at day 15 were optimally
controlled at day 30. Most patients who reached disease control
at day 30 (26 out of 33; 78.7%) but not at day 15 showed DLQI
scores between 5 and 10 (partially controlled) at that previous
time point.

Line 2 was considered after 1 month of follow-up when disease control was not achieved with line 1 (Figure 2). Most uncontrolled patients were scaled up to 4 times anti-H1 dose
(n = 60), except 2 who reported strong sedation. At the 2-month
time point evaluation, 27 out of 60 (45%) patients had reached
control by using line 2 recommendation. In conjunction, rate of
disease control with line 1 and line 2 recommendations was 76%
(95% CI, 69.17%-82.83%).

To evaluate sedation, results from the “sedation” questionnaire were considered in 2 different manners: the perception of
the effect as well as its severity. This adverse effect was frequently
reported with anti-H1 medications, being mild in most of the
cases (Figure 4). Frequency of sedation with conventional dose at
day 30 was high (103 patients out of 150; 68.6%). Sedation rates
increased with up-dosing. In the group receiving higher doses of
anti-H] (line 2), sedation reports increased from 66.7% (20 out
of 60) at day 30 when they were still treated with a conventional
dose to 93.2% (55 out of 59) at 2 months (P < .05). The lowest
mean sedation score was observed in the fexofenadine group
(mean, 2.1 + 1.6; 2-month time point). Post hoc comparisons
among the different anti-H1 indicated that the sedation score of
fexofenadine was significantly lower than that of cetirizine and
bilastine and similar to that of desloratadine (P = .53) and
ebastine (P = .07); 81% of sedation reports for this anti-H1 were
categorized as mild. The 2 patients who discontinued anti-H1
(both receiving cetirizine) were also randomly allocated to any
of the line 3 options, cyclosporine or omalizumab, together with
those not achieving control with anti-H1 medications (n = 33).

cyclosporine and 17 to receive omalizumab. After 2 weeks,
1 patient receiving cyclosporine presented with hypertension and
was then given omalizumab. After 4 months, 12 subjects from
the omalizumab group and 11 from the cyclosporine group
reached a good clinical control (Figure 3). Similar efficacy rates
were observed for the 2 line 3 drugs after 2 months (P = .59).

In the omalizumab group, 4 patients reported headache and 9
reported local pain after subcutaneous injection. In those
receiving cyclosporine, 2 developed transitory hypertension: in
one, blood pressure returned to normal values in less than
2 weeks, but in the other, it persisted over 2 weeks and treatment
was replaced by omalizumab. Six patients reported mild
abdominal pain at some moment but it disappeared during
follow-up. There were no alterations during physical examination, EKG results, or clinical laboratory data after the 6 months
of follow-up.

DISCUSSION

Although different therapeutic agents have been proposed for
the management of CSU, second-generation anti-H1, omalizumab, and cyclosporine are among the narrow group of pharmaceutical approaches recommended in clinical guidelines with
enough scientific support of their safety and effectiveness. In the
Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters, !* representing
the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology and
the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, other
drugs, such as first-generation anti-H1, doxepin, antiinflammatory agents, some immunosuppressants, and biologics,
have been recommended, but only for certain groups of patients.
In this study, using the European urticaria guideline as a
benchmark, which shares similarities with the American proposal, we evaluated their most frequent pharmaceutical recommendations in a cohort of patients with CSU, administering, in a
step-by-step manner, second-generation anti-H1 at a conventional dose or higher and omalizumab or cyclosporine as add-ons
in refractory cases to assess their efficacy and safety.

After avoidance of possible triggers, first line of treatment for
CSU is a second-generation anti-H1. The physiopathology of
urticaria is mostly associated with histamine release. In spite of
this, by using UAS7 to grade symptom severity, some reports
have informed that clinical improvement after anti-H1 treatment
is within the range of 5% to 50%.'’ This low response rate may
be due to the co-release of other proinflammatory substances

 
J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT
VOLUME Mf, NUMBER

during urticaria exacerbations as well as the occurrence of urticaria reactions, which are caused by non—histamine-mediated
mechanisms.'**!? According to our data, there was a significant
proportion of patients whose symptoms were reduced with antiH1 treatment: 76% of them achieved good clinical control with
anti-H1 medications (measured by the DLQI), 58% with conventional doses, and 18% with higher doses. These findings
support the use of anti-H1 medications as the first line of
treatment in patients with CSU. Superior rates of efficacy
observed with our results with regard to those found in other
studies"?! may be due to the application of different scoring
systems. Because most of the patients did not properly register
information for UAS7 scoring, we decided to use DLQI results,
which rather reflect patients’ perception of illness and its impact
on daily activities, even though this questionnaire is not intended
to objectively assess disease severity. Despite the moderate correlation between the DLQI and the UAS (data not shown),
sometimes severity score systems do not reflect the high impact
perceived for patients. For example, most of the patients in our
study had severe symptoms at baseline with significant
improvement after anti-H1 treatment but with occasional relapses; nevertheless, they considered that these exacerbations
were less severe and/or frequent than before and that they may
realize their daily activities without limitations. Another important aspect to be considered is that in real-life studies (as well as
in others with open design), a lower adherence could affect
clinical response. This was a controlled study with a regulated
delivery of medication, which helps to improve adherence to
treatment.

EAACT guidelines recommend evaluating the efficacy of antiH1 at conventional doses after 2 weeks of starting treatment.
Although a placebo control group is necessary to better define a
time point to evaluate the clinical effects of a treatment, it should
be considered that in our findings disease control was achieved in
a great proportion of patients as early as in 15 days, but also that
a significant additional number of them (18%) reached it after
1 month. In a pilot study (n = 54), we observed that a 2-month
therapy with conventional doses did not significantly increase
disease control rates (data not shown), but a 2-week therapy was
significantly better than a 1-week therapy.

It was observed that all anti-H1 drugs had a significant clinical
improving effect on disease symptoms, according to DLQI and
UAS scoring systems. With regard to safety, no alterations in
laboratory tests or EKG results were observed in this sample;
however, more than half the patients (91.8%) reported sedation
as a side effect. Among anti-H1, fexofenadine was the least
sedative. Although second-generation anti-H1 are considered
nonsedating drugs, this adverse effect is reported in some cases.
In this study, its frequency was higher than expected; thus,
alternative explanations to objective drug-related sedation should
be considered. Perhaps the high sedation rate in this Colombian
population is due to a placebo-like effect; although the type of
anti-H1 was blinded for patients, they did know they were
receiving antihistamines. Even though this has not been formally
addressed, there is a general belief in our country that these
medications cause sedation. Another reason could be that the
“sedation” questionnaire has good sensitivity, but low specificity.
Even in those patients who reported a “severe” sedation effect,
only 2 (7.2%) from the cetirizine group dropped out and 72%
scored with “little or no impact” when they were asked for
“treatment impact” through the DLQI questionnaire. In this

 

 

SANCHEZ ET AL 5

sense, objective psychometric assessments are essential to determine the extent of sedation impairment.

Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies
(ASTERIA I, ASTERIA II, and GLACIAL) support, with more
than 900 subjects, the efficacy and safety of omalizumab as an
add-on therapy for patients with CSU who remained symptomatic despite anti-H1 treatment at licensed or higher doses.'”
Kessel and Toubi~~ showed that long-term use of cyclosporine is
effective and safe, even after a 10-year administration in patients
with severe CSU. All these studies demonstrated that both drugs
are useful for treating anti-H1 refractory patients; however, they
do not permit to conclude in which exact rate add-on therapy is
required to achieve disease control because study participants
were selected on the basis of being “nonresponders” to anti-H1
treatment. This has been discussed further by Kaplan.’ The
high response rate to antihistamines in our population could be
due to the placebo effect; however, even after 3 months, most
patients reported adequate control according to the DLQI and
few patients required the third line of management; according to
the quality-of-life measure used, 23% of patients with CSU
(8.7% with DLQI > 10 and 14.7% with DLQI of 6-10)
required omalizumab or cyclosporine, and both therapies had a
good clinical impact in patients without anti-H1 response. There
are few retrospective studies comparing therapies recommended
as third line in guidelines or other alternative therapies.’ In these
studies, subjective evaluation parameters were used. Their use
makes comparisons difficult. In general, omalizumab is preferred
to cyclosporine because of its less toxic profile. We observed that
both therapies (omalizumab and cyclosporine) had a similar
effectiveness in patients with CSU with refractory response to
anti-H1, and in general both were safe options. However,
1 patient receiving cyclosporine presented with a significant
increase in blood pressure and was thus given omalizumab;
once cyclosporine was suspended, the pressure returned to
baseline values in a few days. Although previous studies have
shown that response to cyclosporine could be observed within 1
or 2 weeks of treatment, in our study, omalizumab showed a
faster effect.

 

 

CONCLUSIONS

A total of 92% patients reached a DLQI of 5 or less with
EAACT guideline recommendations after 6 months of treatment,
58% with conventional doses of anti-H1 (line 1), an additional
18% with higher doses (line 2), and 15% with omalizumab or
cyclosporine (line 3). This rate of clinical control and severity
reduction supports the clinical usefulness of urticaria guideline
recommendations. Our results could also contribute to improve
guidelines for the treatment of CSU. One-month therapy with
conventional doses of anti-H1 was superior to the 2-week time
point (proposed in the current recommendations) to evaluate the
efficacy of a drug dose. Also, the low rate of adverse effects within
a 4-month period of administering omalizumab or cyclosporine
indicates that both drugs are well tolerated. It is recommendable
to perform similar studies in patients with inducible urticaria.
