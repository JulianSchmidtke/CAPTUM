ABSTRACT

Chronic idiopathic (spontaneous) urticaria (CIU) is sometimes resistant to the conventional and highdoses of antihistamines
(AHs). This study compares the clinical and laboratory characteristics of AH responsive and AH-resistant CIU subjects.
Clinical and laboratory data were retrospectively collected from 385 CIU patients. Urticaria activity score (UAS), concomitant
angioedema, dermatographism, positive autologous serum skin (ASST), and laboratory data.were collected. The control group
consisted of 44 sex- and age-matched healthy individuals. Two hundred forty-five CIU patients controlled with AH medications
were included in the CIU group. Forty-six patients failed to show clinical improvement during 8 weeks of treatment with
fourfold AH doses and were included in the resistant CIU (R-CIU) group. The R-CIU group was characterized with a higher
incidence (58.7%) of angioedema than the CIU group (28.5%; p < 0.001), moreycases concomitant physical urticaria (23.9%
in R-CIU versus 12.2% in CIU; p = 0.014), more positive ASST (73.9% in R-CIU versus 45.4% in CIU; p < 0.001), and
higher baseline UAS (5.28 + 0.81 in R-CIU versus 3.32 + 1.25 in CIU; <0.001). R-CIU was characterized with more severe
basopenia (0.04 + 0.07 cell/mm? versus 0.16 + 0.13 cell/mm*; p < 0.001), higher mean platelet volume (10.87 + 2.21
femtoliter (fl) versus 8.65 + 1.74 fl; p < 0.001), higher levels of C-reactive protein (8.62 + 3.91 mg/L versus 2.49 + 1.34 mg/L;
<0.001), and higher levels of serum C3 (1.66 + 0.36 g/L versus 1.19 + 0.35 g/L; p < 0.001. R-CIU is a clinically more severe

disease with laboratory features of low-grade inflammation and platelet activation.

Ure is widely regarded as a heterogeneous
group of diseases that share a distinct skin reaction pattern, i.e., the development, of urticarial skin
esions.'” Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is defined
as wheals arising spontaneously without any external
physical stimuli, and the disease lasts >6 weeks.’
Patients with CIU, which is also referred to chronic
spontaneous urticaria (CSU), are often unsatisfied with
he standardtreatment and their quality of life is diferentially impaired.* The recent guidelines recommend as a first-line therapy, nonsedating H,-antihistamines (AHs), increasing their dosage as second-line
reatment, adding-aleukotriene antagonist or switching to another AH as the third-line treatment.’ Although guideline-recommended AH updosing improves symptom control in the majority of affected
subjects, both our clinical experience and published
clinical studies show that a considerable number of
patients have only little benefit from higher doses of
AHs.? Currently, all other treatments of AH-resistant
CIU are off-label.

There are four aspects that seem to be associated
with a prognosis of CIU: (i) disease severity, (ii) angioedema, (iii) combination of CIU with physical urticaria,
and (iv) autoreactivity (positivity in the autologous
serum skin test [ASST]).'°"! Recent findings indicate
that activation of the coagulation cascade resulting in
thrombin production” is a prominent feature of exacerbations in CIU and that intradermal injection of autologous plasma causes wheal-and-flare reactions with
a higher frequency than autologous serum injections.'*
Moreover, severe exacerbations of CIU are associated
with a strong activation of the coagulation cascade and
fibrinolysis.'* Within the coagulation cascade, thrombin is a serine protease that induces activation of platelets and may play a key role in chronic urticaria.'*
Several studies indicate that platelet volume is in direct
correlation with platelet function, because large platelets are more reactive and a presence of large platelets
in blood is an in vivo indicator of platelet activity.’°
Large platelets are denser, they produce more thromboxane B2 per unit volume of platelet cytoplasm,'°
they contain more a- and dense granules, and preferential aggregation of large platelets is observed after
addition of adenosine diphosphate,'* collagen, and
thrombin.” They also release more serotonin and other
granule contents and express more glycoprotein Ib per
unit area.’®

In the previous study, we observed a positive correlation between clinical severity of CIU with ASST autoreactivity, increased mean platelet volume (MPV),

and C-reactive protein.'? The objectives of this study
were to estimate the proportion of patients with CIU at
an outpatient allergy clinic who do not respond to AHs
and to examine if AH-resistant CIU patients have any
clinical and laboratory characteristics distinguishing
them from the AH responders.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Patients

We retrospectively studied cases of adult (age, >18
years) patients who were referred to the outpatient
allergy clinic from the Ashdod region (Ashdod, Israel)
between January 2007 and January 2011 because of a
diagnosis of CIU and/or angioedema of at least 6-week
duration. The study was approved by the Regional
Committee for Medical Research Ethics.

Patients with urticarial vasculitis (UV) were excluded. All those included in the study had negative
skin-prick tests to a large panel of commercial food
allergens. All CIU patients were treated according to
the current guidelines on the management of urticaria.*

Clinical Evaluation of CSU

Clinical and laboratory evaluation and classification
of chronic urticaria were performed according to a joint
initiative of the Dermatology Section of the European
Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology, the
EU-funded network of excellence, the Global Allergy
and Asthma European Network, the European Dermaology Forum and the World»Allergy Organization
guidelines.'4 ASST was performed with 50 wL of the
patient’s undiluted serum after allowing blood to clot
at room temperature for 30 minutes and after sample
blood centrifugation at500 < g for 10 minutes, which
was then injected intradermally into the volar aspect of
he forearm together with simultaneously injected controls; including saline and 10 wg/mL of histamine. The
mean diameters of the wheals were measured at 30
minutes. The test was considered positive if the seruminjected site manifested a wheal with a diameter of at
east.1.5 mm greater than that of the saline. Dermographism was assessed using firm stroking of the skin
by a dermographometer with a pressure of 4900 g/ cm?
and induction of linear itchy wheals within several
minutes.

 

Assessment of Urticaria Severity

For CIU, several scoring systems have been proposed using scales from 0 to 3 or up to 10 points.* A
unified and simple scoring system, the urticaria activity score (UAS), was proposed in the last version of a
joint initiative of the Dermatology Section of the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology, the EU-funded network of excellence, the Global
Allergy and Asthma European Network, the European

Allergy and Asthma Proceedings

Dermatology Forum and the World Allergy Organization guidelines.’ This scoring system is suitable for the
evaluation of disease activity by urticaria patients and
their treating physicians.

UAS represents a simple semiquantitative assessment of disease activity and it calculates key urticaria
symptoms, wheals, and itching. The patients were
asked to document a number of wheals and.intensity
of pruritus during 24 hours. The following scoring
system was used: for wheals, mo wheals = 0, <20
wheals/24 hours = 1, 20-50 wheals/24 hours = 2, >50
wheals/24 hours or large confluent areas of wheals =
3; for pruritus, no pruritus= 0, mild pruritus without
troublesome = 1, moderate pruritus, that is troublesome but not interfering with normal daily activity or
sleep = 2, and intense pruritus = 3. The UAS is the
sum score Of 7 consecutive days, used routinely in our
clinical practice to determine disease activity and response to treatment of CIU patients. The UAS was
applied during each consultation and was recorded in
the medical records.

AH Treatment and Response Assessment

The modern nonsedating H,-AHs were used by all
patients as first-line treatment. We usually use fexofenadine hydrochloride (Telfast, 180 mg q.d.; sanofiaventis, Netanya, Israel), desloratadine at 5 mg q.d.
(Aerius; Schering-Plough, Hod Hasharon, Israel), or
cetirizine at 10 mg q.d. (Zyllergy; Dexcel Pharma, Jerusalem, Israel) as drugs of choice in the treatment of
patients with CIU. Patients with significant improvement of CIU (at least a 50% reduction of their UAS)
under conventional doses of AH medications were
included in the CIU group.

In CIU patients who did not respond sufficiently to
the approved dose, an updosing of the H;-AHs up to
fourfold was performed. AH treatment was considered
effective if the patient reported the total or near-total
disappearance of wheals and the absence of angioedema and pruritus. The patients with persisting pruritus and recurrent wheals (with or without angioedema), despite a full 8-week AH treatment, were
considered as having AH treatment failure and were
included in the resistant CIU (R-CIU) group. No H,blockers, corticosteroids, or immunomodulatory medications were prescribed before the updosing of AH
medications. The control group consisted of 44 sexand age-matched healthy individuals recruited from
the hospital and the primary care center staff. Written
informed consent was given by control group participants.

Laboratory Evaluation of CIU
All of the patients did their laboratory investigations
before beginning the treatment with AH medications,

which began the next day after the first allergology
consultation. Blood samples were drawn from each
subject by antecubital venipuncture between 8 and 10
A.M.. All analyses were performed within a period of
2-3 hours after blood collection. Citrated blood was
used with an automated blood counter (Sysmex;
Roche) for determination of blood count and MPV. C3
and C4 component levels were measured by the
ABICAP assay (Biognosis, Jiilich, Germany). The normal standardized values for each component were 80180 mg/dL for C3 and 10-40 mg/dL for C4. Blood
levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)
were measured by immunonephelometry using BN
Systems (Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany) and the
reference interval for hs-CRP was 1-3 mg/L.

Statistical Analysis

Comparison of categorical variables between groups
was performed by chi-square test and Fisher’s exact
test (two-tailed) as appropriate. Continuous variables
are expressed as mean + SD and were compared between groups by Student's t-test (two-tailed). Forvall
tests the value of p < 0.05 was considered significant.
All statistical analyses were performed using, the software Statistica 6 (StatSoft, Inc., Chicago, IL).

RESULTS

During the study period, 385 patients with urticarial diseases lasting >6 weeks»were referred to our
allergy clinic. Two hundred eighty-nine patients
were diagnosed as having CIU. Among them, 46
(15.9%) patients.failed to show at least a 50% UAS
reduction during 8-week treatment with fourfold
AH doses. These subjects were included in the R-CIU
group. The remaining 245 patients whose urticaria
was, controlled with AH medications were included
in the CIV. groupy

Demographic characteristics of the study groups are
presented in Table 1. The R-CIU group was characterized with.a longer duration of urticaria, women were
more frequently involved in both group CIU and
group R-CIU (Table 1).

 

Clinical Characteristics of Study Groups

Angioedema. The R-CIU group was characterized
with a higher incidence (58.7%) of angioedema than
the CIU group (28.5%; p < 0.001).

Concomitant Dermatographism/Pressure Urticaria. The
prevalence of concomitant physical urticaria (dermatographism and/or pressure urticaria) was significantly higher in the R-CIU group (23.9%) than in the
CIU group (12.2%; p = 0.014).

462

Autoreactivity/Positive ASST. Among the CIU patients, ASST was performed in 174 subjects, and the
test was positive in 79 (45.4%) of them. ASST was
performed in all R-CIU patients and the test was positive in 34 (73.9%; p < 0.001) subjects.

Urticaria Activity Score. No differences between the
study groups were observed in urticarial wheal distribution on the skin surfaces. Nevertheless, baseline
UAS was higher in the R-CIU group (5.28 + 0.81) than
in the CIU group (3.32 + 1.25; p < 0.001); significant
differences in UAS between the study groups were
observed also after 8 weeks (R-CIU group, 4.35 + 0.94,
versus CIU group, 1.14 + 0.62; p< 0.001) and 16 weeks
(R-CIU group, 1.42 + 0.76, versus CIU group, 0; p <
0.001) of treatment. Clinical response rate assessment
to the treatment with standard and fourfold doses of
AHs is presented in Table 2.

Laboratory Characteristics of Study Groups

Blood Count. There were no significant differences in
white blood cell, lymphocytes, or eosinophils, but a
lower number of circulating basophils was detected in
the blood of R-CIU group subjects (0.04 + 0.07 cell/
mm?) than in the CIU group subjects (0.16 + 0.13
cell/mm*; p < 0.001) and healthy controls (0.18 + 0.15
cell/mm*; p < 0.001).

Mean Platelet Volume. There were no significant differences in platelet counts between the groups; nevertheless, the platelets in the R-CIU group were characterized by a higher MPV (10.87 + 2.21 femtoliter [fl])
than the platelets in the CIU group (8.65 + 1.74 fl; p <
0.001) and healthy controls (7.59 + 1.08 fl; p < 0.001).

Antinuclear Antibodies. In the R-CSU group, the incidence of antinuclear antibodies was significantly
higher (9 [19.6%]) than in the CSU group (11 [6.3%];
p = 0.003)) and in healthy controls (2 [4.5%]; p = 0.048).

Liver Enzymes. In subjects with R-CIU, there was a
slight but statistically significant elevation of liver
transaminases [alanine aminotransferase (47.6 + 14.2)
versus (21.8 + 13.7; p = 0.024) in the CIU group and
versus healthy controls (23.5 + 12.9; p < 0.001)] and
[AST (28.3 + 11.4) versus (18.5 + 10.2; p < 0.001) in CIU
group and versus healthy controls (17.3 + 11.1; p <
0.001)].

C-Reactive Protein. Higher levels of hs-CRP were
measured in the R-CIU group (8.62 + 3.91 mg/L) than
in the CIU group (2.49 + 1.34; <0.001) and the control
group (2.76 + 1.63; p < 0.001).

MPV = mean platelet volume; fl = femtoliter; TSH = thyroid stimulating hormone; BMI = body mass index; CSU = chronic
spontaneous urticaria; ANA = antinuclear antibodies; ESR = erythrocyte sedimentation rate; ASST = autologous serum skin
test; ALT = serum_alanine aminotransferase (normal range, 8—41 IU/L); AST = serum aspartate aminotransferase (normal
range, 10-38 IU/L); ALP. = serum alkaline phosphatase (normal range, 39-117 IU/L); WBC = white blood cell count; p =

Complement C3 and C4 Components. In the R-CIU
group, serum C3 (1.66 + 0.36 g/L) was higher than in
the CIU group (1.19 + 0.35; p < 0.001) and healthy
controls (1.13 + 0.29; p < 0.001). No significant difference in C4 between the groups was observed (Table 1).
In the CIU group, there was a weak but statistically
significant positive correlation (r = 0.23138; p = 0.002)
between baseline UAS and serum C3 levels. More
powerful statistically significant positive correlation
(r = 0.36920; p = 0.012) between baseline UAS and
serum C3 levels were observed in the R-CSU group.

DISCUSSION

In the study, we investigated clinical and laboratory
characteristics of CIU patients with different response
patterns to H,-AHs. In our CIU cohort only 46 (15.9%)
patients were defined to be resistant to fourfold AH

Allergy and Asthma Proceedings

doses. The previous studies show that one-half or less
of CIU patients responded with a complete control of
symptoms to licensed AH doses; in those who did not
succeed with standard AH doses, increasing the AH
dose improved treatment responses but still every
third to fourth patient remained symptomatic.”° Although we identified less AH-resistant subjects in our
CIU population, it is difficult to compare the AH response rates with the previous studies because different authors examined different urticarial populations
with different disease severities.

Our study clearly shows that women suffer from
CIU more frequently than men do and this finding is
consistent with the previous epidemiological studies.2?2 For AHs neither resistance nor other clinical
factors (angioedema, ASST positivity, and concomitant
dermatographism) seem to alter this proportion.

The prevalence of symptomatic dermatographism/
pressure urticaria occurring in combination with
CIU was also higher in the R-CIU group. These
observations are similar to previous .observations’? ° and probably reflect a predominance of
moderate-to-severe cases in the R-CIU group. CIU
severity could furthermore explain the fact that AHresistant patients were characterized by higher autoreactivity (more cases of ASST* patients). As it was
previously observed, ASST* CIU patients require
more AH medications than ASST~ patients.””

We also found basopenia in both study groups, and
R-CIU patients.were characterized by lowest number
of blood basophiles. Basophils are the least frequent of
the granulocytes, in humans ordinarily accounting for
<0.5% of circulating leukocytes and under physiologicaleonditions,they have a short life-span of several
days. Distinguishing the contributions between basophils and mast cells in IgE-mediated hypersensitivity
reactions has centered on their disparate anatomic locations. In contrast to mast cells, basophils enter the
circulation fully mature, but their recruitment to tissues is generally believed to be restricted to delayed
ate-phase allergic inflammation that occurs hours after
antigen exposure~’ and in several model systems, opimal basophil accumulation in tissues was highly
CD4* T-cell dependent.*°
Basopenia in CIU is a well-known phenomenon, and
it may reflect enhanced basophil consumption. Besides
he basopenia, intrinsic defects of the anti-IgE crossinking signaling pathway of basophiles have been described in CIU.*! Basophil activation marker (CD63,
CD69, and CD203c) expression is increased in CIU
subjects and is not associated with serum factors.°* CIU
basophils have several specific features that distin
 

464

guish them from basophils of a healthy population.
They are fewer respondents to anti-IgE and C5a with
no difference when stimulated with bradykinin and
monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and have a much
higher release when incubated with serum.*? Additional studies need to be performed to determine if
there are more profound defects in signaling and/or
activation pathways of basophils in R-CIU that could
play some role in mechanisms of AH resistance. An
increase in CRP in R-CIU may reflect a possible role of
a systemic inflammatory process in pathophysiology of
the disease. IL-6 is involved in megakaryocyte maturation in vitro and is increased in CIU patients.** In
patients with acute allergic reactions, elevations of serum interleukin IL-6 were also felt to be key in promoting CRP elevations.*° These IL-6 elevations occur
later than elevations in blood histamine or tryptase
levels. Because many studies of IL-6 have shown that
CRP and IL-6 are correlated in disease and in normal
humans, it suggests the possibility that acute-phase
responses may also occur in CIU and it would be
speculated that the CRP elevations in ASST* CIU relates, to some degree, to systemic mast cell and basophil activation.*°

We believe the most interesting finding of our study
is the significant difference in complement C3 component between the study groups. To the best of our
knowledge, it is the first description of a relation between C3, clinical severity, and AH resistance in CIU
using a relatively large CIU population. In the recent
study, a reduction in C3 and C4 was found in a small
group of CIU ASST* patients.” Our study of a larger
group of CIU subjects provided opposite results. It is
accepted that some patients admitted to the hospital
for investigation of severe chronic urticaria are found

to have UV. In one retrospective single-center study,
18% of patients with biopsy-confirmed UV exhibited a
hypocomplementemic form of chronic urticaria.**
However, our CIU patients did not have diagnostic
criteria for UV and, actually, UV was an exclusion
criterion of the study.

Complement C3 protein synthesis is increased in
response to inflammation and infection but at a slower
rate than for traditional acute phase proteins.°°° The
iver (mainly hepatocytes) is responsible for the biosynthesis of 90% of plasma complement components
and their soluble regulators, including 3.41 C3a has
been reported to induce histamine release from human
skin mast cells.47 Moreover, C3a is an active mediator
in stimulating chemotaxis and mobilization of cord
blood-derived and cutaneous mast cells.*° C3, C4, and
anaphylatoxins are known to be elevated in the serum
of patients with inflammatory diseases.“* We can speculate that elevated circulating amounts of C3 and liver
ransaminases levels may be related to hepatic fat accumulation and of a general low-grade inflammatory
response in CR-CIU patients.*°

We understand that the study has several limitaions, mainly related to its retrospective nature, viz., a
ack of randomization and blinding. Second,recording
bias is an important possible limitation. Third, we did
not investigate a possible role of the observed “lowgrade inflammation” in the pathophysiology of AH
resistance in CIU.*° These issues remain to be studied
in future experiments.

The analysis of symptom/medication score data employed ANCOVA which requires normally distributed data. Logarithmic
transformatin of the data was performed and then ANCOVA conducted. The original subtraction of placebo minus active
became a ratio of placebo to active with the difference calculated as placebo- relative- to- active and not as is customary
assessing active- relative- to- placebo. All results have now been recalculated as active- relative- to- placebo. No changes
in statistical significances of any data including p-values were subsequently noted consequent to this change in reference
from placebo- relative- to- active to active- relative- to- placebo.
