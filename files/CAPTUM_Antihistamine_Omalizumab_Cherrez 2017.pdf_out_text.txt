Abstract

Background: The current EAACI/GA*LEN/EDF/WAO guideline for urticaria provide specific recommendations for the
diagnostic workup and treatment of patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CsU). This study explored if
physicians in Ecuador know these recommendations and implement them in their actual clinical practice for CsU.

Methods: We investigated physicians who treat CsU patients in a cross-sectional study using a standardized
questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were employed, adjusted logistic regression was performed to assess the link of
guideline knowledge and use of therapy.

Results: Seven hundred forty surveys were collected and analyzed. The mean age of physicians was 42.3 (+12.5) years.
Most of the participants (65.1%) were general physicians (GP), 13.7% were pediatricians, 11.0% internists, 6.8%
dermatologists or allergists (D/A). Only 18.8% knew the EAACI/GA7LEN/EDF/WAO guideline. 44.5% of GPs searched for
CsU etiology in contrast to 90% of D/A. Most common diagnostic test was total serum IgE (83.5%). Most common first
line symptomatic treatment was oral corticoids (46.3%), followed by second generation antihistamines (sgAHs, 36.8%).
A/D prescribed more sgAHs (regular doses) (74.1 vs 28.6% of GP) (p < 0.05). Experience with omalizumab was reported
only by 3.5%, of physicians, and higher rates among who were familiar with the guideline.

Conclusion: This study shows that the knowledge of guideline recommendations in physicians who treat urticaria
patients in Ecuador is low. The diagnostic workup and treatment of CsU patients are largely not in line with guideline
recommendations in real life practice settings. We were able to compare results between German and Ecuadorian
physicians and found that Ecuadorian physicians have lower awareness of the current guideline (33 vs 18%). Only
one-third of physicians reported using regular doses of sgAHs as the first line treatment. Also, only 12.9% of physicians
use sgAHs in higher doses and physicians still use fgAHs, particularly pediatricians (42.9%). Our results suggest that
disparities in knowledge between physicians from different countries could influence the management of CsU.
Knowledge of the guidelines is linked to better choices of treatments. Awareness of guidelines needs to be promoted
for better management of chronic urticaria.

Background

Urticaria is a disease characterized by the development of wheals (hives), angioedema or both. Chronic
urticaria (CU) is defined by the appearance of these
signs and symptoms for 26 weeks and is categorized
into two main types: chronic spontaneous urticaria
(CsU) and chronic inducible urticaria [1]. CsU is
thought to affect 0.5-1% of the global population at
any given time, accounting for approximately twothirds of all cases of CsU. Chronic Urticaria can have
a considerable burden on patients, healthcare systems
and society [2].

Different studies have evaluated the economic impact
of CsU and a total annual cost of $ 2047 per patient has
been estimated, with indirect costs accounted for 15.7%
($322) [3]. More importantly, this disease is commonly
associated with an impairment of patients in many aspects of their daily living (e.g. their choice of clothes or
food) [4], with marked impact on their quality of life
(QoL) and productivity (e.g. impaired work performance,
absence from work) [3].

Several guidelines, consensus papers, and practice parameters are available for the management of chronic
urticaria. The leading international guideline is the
EAACI/GA?LEN/EDE/WAO guideline for urticaria,
which was revised and updated in 2013. National practice parameters include those of the US American
AAAAT/ACAAI Joint Task Force, which were updated in
2014. The recommendations given by all of these documents are similar, although some minor differences exist
[5]. For example, the EAACI/GA*LEN/EDF/WAO
guideline for urticaria does not recommend H2 antihistamines or first generation antihistamines for CsU,
whereas the US practice parameters do [6].

The EAACI/GA°*LEN/EDF/WAO guideline for urticaria provides a set of specific recommendations for the
management of CU. For example, they recommend a
stepwise approach in the management of CsU, beginning
with licensed doses of modern second generation H1antihistamines (sgAHs) [1] as the first line therapy,
which is effective in resolving symptoms in about 40% of
patients with CsU [2]. As second line therapy, the guideline recommends increasing the doses of sgAHs up to
four times the regular doses, if a patient does not respond to first line treatment after 2 weeks. For patients
non-responsive to higher doses of sgAHs, the guideline
recommends the addition of a third-line treatment option
such as omalizumab, cyclosporine or montelukast [1].

Recent studies on guideline and awareness in physicians who treat urticaria patients have shown interesting
results. In one such study, performed in Germany, the
level of urticaria guideline knowledge was highest in dermatologists (50.6%) when compared with pediatricians
(24.2%) and general physicians (12.6%). Physicians who

Page 2 of 10

were familiar with the guidelines were significantly more
likely to perform useful diagnostic tests such as the
ASST (autologous serum skin test). However, even in
physicians who knew the guideline, the test was still only
performed by one of five physicians. Physicians who
stated to be familiar with the guidelines were less likely
to use sedating antihistamines and systemic steroids as a
first- and/or second-line treatment, indicating that
guideline recommendations may improve the quality
of care [7].

Most of the studies performed indicate that the knowledge and awareness of guidelines for the management
of patients with chronic urticaria is low in physicians
who treat them. This may be responsible, at least in part,
for the fact that more than 70% of the patients had
stopped consulting a physician, resigning themselves to
self-treatment or simply living with their condition [8].

As of now, little is known about the knowledge of
urticaria guidelines in physicians in Latin America
who treat urticaria patients or about their clinical
practice and the impact of guidelines. Our study
intended to explore the awareness and knowledge of
urticaria guidelines in physicians in Ecuador and to
better characterize and understand the actual clinical
practice for CsU.

Methods

From March 2015 to March 2016 we conducted a crosssectional survey study using a standardized questionnaire. This was approved by the Ethics Committee of
Hospital Luis Vernaza.

The participants were physicians, and this survey covered several topics about CsU: general questions about
urticaria (e.g. prevalence, duration, and disease activity),
questions about the diagnostic and therapeutic management of CsU as well as consequences of insufficient
symptom control. In addition, questions on how the
physicians perceive the patients, self-assessment of the
participating physicians and questions concerning the
implementation of the current guidelines were also
addressed.

Recruitment

The target populations were general physicians and specialists from Ecuador attending the Respiratory and Allergy Medicine Conference and physicians working in
hospitals and private practices in different cities of
Ecuador. The participation criterion was having a diploma in medicine and being a certified medical doctor.
When a candidate was identified, we asked if he/she
often sees patients with urticaria. Once agreed, the data
collection team asked for consent and delivered the selfassessment survey.

Study survey

The original survey questions were previously developed
by an expert panel from Germany. It has been successfully pretested for comprehensibility and feasibility in a
limited number of physicians (1 = 32). We used a rigorous method of validation for the translated version of
the German questionnaire [1, 9] which we briefly
described. Two official translators translated the German
version (GV) of the original survey to Spanish. Next, the
Spanish-language version was translated to German language by a third translator who did not know the
original version of the questionnaire. Then, the backtranslated German version of the new Spanish-language
questionnaire was compared with the original Germanlanguage version. Each item on the back-translated
German-language version was ranked by 30 individuals
who were bilingual and independent of the study team
for comparability and similarity of interpretability with
the same item on the original German-language version.
Any translated item with a mean score >3 (seven was
the worst agreement and one was the best agreement)
was formally reviewed and corrected. The revised item
was then translated back to German and compared
again with the original German-language version of that
item. This process continued until the mean scores for
each item indicated a valid version (<3 on each of the
comparability and interpretability rankings, and preferably <2.5 on the interpretability rankings) [9].

In total, the survey consisted of 32 questions, mostly
involving Likert-scale ratings, quantitative questions,
yes / no lists and multiple choice questions (the
complete survey can be provided upon request). Only
physicians who reported attending at least one patient
at month with idiopathic chronic urticaria were considered for analysis. Also, the outliers values of patients
reported to be attended with chronic urticaria at last
month were excluded of analysis (1 = 31, 6.6%). After
that, the values left blank automatically were treated as
missing values, in total, 7.3% of data were missed.
Further missing value analysis determined that these
missing values were random.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics were employed to compare frequencies and percentages values are given as means and
standard deviation (SD), unless specified otherwise. We
used Chi square test to compare proportions across specialty groups (allergists/dermatologist, general physician,
internal medicine, pediatrician, and others) and between
physicians who do or do not know the EAACI/
GA°’LEN/EDE/WAO guideline for the management of
urticaria. Finally, adjusted logistic regression was performed to test the association of guideline knowledge
and use of second line therapy for confounders

(physicians’ specialty and location, years in practice, and
gender. SPSS version 20 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL) was
employed. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered
significant for all tests.

Results

Demographics

From March 2015 to March 2016, a total of 740 surveys
were collected, and 438 (59.2%) of physicians reported
attending at least one patient with idiopathic chronic urticaria. The mean age of the physicians was 42.3 (+12.5)
years, an average of 15.0 years of practice (411.2), and
51.5% were female. The majority of the participants
(65.1%) were general physicians (GP), 13.7% were pediatricians, 11.0% internists, 6.8% dermatologists or allergists (D/A), and 3.4% belonged to other professional
groups (Table 1). Most of the physicians (81.1%) worked
in urban areas and 47.0% were working as single practice
physicians. Pediatricians reported to see 5.3 (SD 5.1)
patients with CsU compared to 15.8 (SD 9.6) patients
with atopic dermatitis per month.

Few physicians know the EAACI/GA7LEN/EDF/WAO
urticaria guideline

Only 79 of 421 (18.8%) physicians reported to know the
EAACI/GA?LEN/EDE/WAO urticaria guideline, and
more than half of them (66.7%) were D/As (Additional
file 1: Figure $1). 60 of 419 (14.3%) physicians surveyed
reported that they know other guidelines (Additional
file 2: Figure S2).

Chronic spontaneous urticaria is a frequent diagnosis

In general, physicians attended a mean of 4.7 patients
with CsU per month (SD 4.4, median 3.0, IQR 2 — 6).
GPs responded that they see approximately 4.8 patients
with CsU per month (SD 4.5). D/As reported that they
see 4,3 (SD 3.1) patients with CsU per month, as compared to 5.2 (SD 2.8) patients with psoriasis vulgaris. In
contrast, pediatricians reported to see 5.3 (SD 5.1) patients with CsU compared to 15.8 (SD 9.6) patients with
atopic dermatitis per month.

CsU patients are subjected to multiple diagnostic tests
196 physicians (49.4%) reported to look for causes of
CU. 52.9% of the GPs search for the causes of CsU in
contrast to 85.0% of the D/As who were aware of guidelines (Fig. la—b). The cause of urticaria was identified
only in approx. 34.2% of patients and this was similar for
both GPs and D/As.

The most common diagnostic tests performed were
total serum IgE (83.5%), differential blood count
(59.5%), serological tests (56.5%), allergy test (prick test)
(56.0%), C-reactive protein / erythrocyte sedimentation

rate (46.5%), autoimmune diagnostic (45.5%), thyroid
hormones and autoantibodies (34.5%), and autologous
serum skin test (13.5%).

Important differences were observed in the preference
for laboratory testing and other specialist consultations
between groups. The majority of the D/As ordered more
serological tests in comparison to the GPs (Table 2), and
there was a similar trend for the diagnostic workup of
autoimmune diseases, thyroid hormones and autoantibodies, IgE tests, helicobacter tests, dentist consultation
(p <0.05). However, autologous serum skin test and allergy test (prick test) were similar between all groups
(Table 2). Diagnostic tests were performed more frequently by physicians who know the EAACI/GA7LEN/
EDF/WAO guideline (Table 2).

Most physicians do not treat CsU patients according to
guideline recommendations

The most used first choice symptomatic treatment in previously untreated patients was an oral corticosteroid
(OCS), by 46.3% of physicians. 40.7% of D/As reported
having experience with OCS treatment, but only 57.1% are
convinced that this therapy is useful. Second generation
antihistamines (sgAHs) were used in approved dose by
36.8% of physicians as first line treatment; (74.1%) of D/

As, (29.1%) of GPs (28.6% of pediatricians and 37.5% of internists, (p< 0.001, Table 3). First generation antihistamines (fgAHs), at normal doses, were used by 13.9% of the
respondents as first choice treatment. Meanwhile, fgAHs
at higher doses were used by 7.0%. Physicians, who were
familiar with the EAACI/GA?LEN/EDE/WAO guideline,
were more likely to use higher doses of fgAHs (14.0 vs
4.8% of those who do not know the guidelines) (p < 0.05,
Table 3). Despite years of practice, specialties, location,
and gender, these physicians report using higher doses of
fgAHs (OR 4.3; CI 1.1-16.4) (Table 4). Pediatricians use
most frequently (42.9%) fgAHs as first line treatment
(Table 3). We did not find any statistical differences
(p> 0.05) according to awareness of guidelines and use
of normal doses of sgAHs (Table 3).

In approximately one quarter of patients (26.9%, SD
20.9), the first applied therapy was reported not to be
successful (D/As 32.6%, GPs 28.6%, Internists 20.8% and
Pediatricians 21.3%).

Only 12.9% of physicians used sgAHs in higher doses
as second line treatment, and there is a statistically significant difference between D/A and GPs (51.9 vs. 7.7%;
p<0.001). Physicians stated that the use of sgAHs in
normal or higher doses was successful in approximately
65% of CsU patients (Table 5). Physicians, who were

Adverse effects of therapy

Physicians reported that no adverse effects were
observed in 42.1% of patients receiving regular doses of
sgAHs and in 45.2% treated with higher doses of sgAHs.
Elevating the doses of sgAHs didn’t appear to result in
an increase in adverse effect rates (Table 5).

Adherence and quality of life

The most frequent problems that physicians observed in
their patients following CsU therapy, were reported to
be in 38.6% adherence, 31.2% somnolence, 13.3% the
cost of treatment and in 13.0% gastrointestinal symptoms. Physicians also reported that patients, who are
resistant to treatment, are more vulnerable to have daily
life problems, such as reduced QoL (40.9% of patients),
social isolation (27.4%), and occupational disability
(22.3%). Half of the physicians reported that their patients have an increased psychological burden as a consequence of the disease.

Approximately 50% of physicians responded that they
need more time than usual for CsU patients and that the
cost in medications and diagnostic tests for these patients is higher as compared to patients with other

Page 7 of 10

diseases. 62.1% of the physician reported referring patients to urticaria specialists.

Discussion

This study shows that the knowledge of guideline recommendations in physicians who treat urticaria patients
in Ecuador is low. The diagnostic workup and treatment
of CsU patients is largely not in line with guideline recommendations in real life practice settings.

The EAACI/GA*LEN/EDF/WAO — guideline _ for
chronic urticaria has been recently updated [1], but the
management of CsU varies among different parts of the
world [1, 10-12]. Given the fact that this survey was
previously used in Germany [7], we could compare
results between the two regions and found that
Ecuadorian physicians have lower awareness of the
current guideline (33 vs 18%). Less than one quarter
of GPs know the EAACI/GA*LEN/EDE/WAO guideline, but approximately two thirds of the D/As do.
Physicians who know the guideline were aware of the
importance of searching for the cause of CsU and
this was found in approximately one third of patients.
Interestingly specialist D/A, who report not to know
the guidelines, still look for the etiology of CsU in
their patients. (Fig. la and b).

In the EAACI/GA7LEN/EDE/WAO guideline, only differential blood count and CRP or ESR are recommended
as routine diagnostic tests for CsU patients [1]. Approximately half of the surveyed physicians don’t follow these
recommendations. This could increase unnecessarily the
costs of searching for CsU etiology.

Early studies suggested that almost 40% of the patients previously diagnosed with CsU had circulating
autoantibodies, which might be implicated in the
pathogenesis [13, 14].

A recent EAACI taskforce position paper proposed
that the ‘gold standard’ for autoimmune chronic urticaria diagnosis should be a combination of a positive
bioassay, positive auto reactivity and a positive immunoassay [15]. In Ecuador, we only have the possibility to do ASST (autologous serum skin test).
Interestingly, 12.9% of participants use this test, in line
with guideline recommendations. Notably, those physicians who were familiar with the current guidelines
were significantly more likely to perform an ASST,
similar to the results of the previous study [7]. Although the most common diagnostic test performed
was the determination of total serum IgE (83.5%), ultimately it is not useful in the management of most
chronic urticaria patients. We believe that, for a great
number of GPs, chronic urticaria could be synonymous
with allergy. Therefore, they perform this test and determine the total serum IgE.

 
Cherrez et al. World Allergy Organization Journal (2017) 10:21

The prevalence of parasitic infection in Ecuador is
approximately 65%, especially soil-transmitted helminth
species [16, 17]. In our country, parasites in the stool are
not routinely looked for, despite of the high prevalence
of parasitic infections. Because physicians are aware
of the high prevalence of parasitic disorders in Ecuador,
they prefer to treat CsU patients with antiparasitic drugs
without looking for it.

Our study confirms that CsU severely affects patients’
quality of life. Acccording to the participating physicians
of our study, more than 40% of patients have QoL impairment and 50% have psychological burden as a consequence of the disease. These results support the need to
incorporate in the evaluation of CsU patients an objective diagnostic measure, a survey for example, to assess
their QoL impairment and to rule out disorders such as
depression and anxiety.

Therapy of CsU

The EAACI/GA*LEN/EDE/WAO guideline for urticaria
recommends the use of a regular dosed sgAHs as the
first line therapy, followed by the use of sgAH in higher
doses up to four times the regular dose, for those patients who do not respond to first line therapy [1, 10].

In our study, only one third of physicians reported to
use regular doses of sgAHs as the first line treatment.
Also, only 12.9% of physicians use sgAHs in higher doses
and there is a statistic significant difference between D/
A and GPs (Table 3). Physicians reported that 35% of
the patients did not respond to this treatment. This contrasts with the results from the previous german study,
where the majority of physicians reported to use regular
doses and high doses of sgAHs as first and second line
therapy, respectively.

Physicians still use fgAHs, particularly pediatricians;
they probably consider this medication safe. After all,
some practice parameters continue to recommend them
{12]. In another study, hydroxyzine was the second most
frequently prescribed drug, with no difference between
dermatologists and allergists [18]. This could be the explanation why physicians, who are aware of the EAACI/
GA°’LEN/EDE/WAO guideline, are more likely to report
using higher doses of fgAHs. Another possible explanation could be that fgAHs, in Ecuador, cost less than
sgAHs.

The use of systemic steroids is not recommended as
the first line therapy [1, 10, 12]; however it is still used
by a meaningful number of physicians in our study. One
possible explanation for the preference of steroids could
be that these physicians have more experience and feel
confident using them a rather than increasing the doses
of sgAHs, as recommended in the guideline. Another explanation could be that they believe steroids relieve
symptoms faster than other drugs. Interestingly, D/A

 

 

Page 8 of 10

reported having experience with oral steroids but less
than half are not convinced that this therapy has been
useful.

Increasing the dosage up to fourfold of modern second
generation AH is a relatively new recommendation and
probably physicians are not confident enough using
them, because up-dosing antihistamines significantly improved control of pruritus but not of wheal number and
there are weakness of the studies and the significant heterogeneity [19] or are afraid of possible adverse effects
with the dosage increase.

On the other hand, systemic steroids are cheaper than
the fourfold dosage of sgAHs and this difference in costs
could influence the physician’s decision. We believe all
this could explain the low use of higher doses of sgAHs
in our study. Indeed, coverage and payment for healthcare may play an important role in our country. As previously discussed, costs vary among drugs and this may
influence patient and physicians’ choices. Public hospitals may not cover third line therapy in our country,
thereby obstructing with physicians’ treatment and
management.

Differing to the previous German study, we could not
find a difference between physicians aware vs not aware
of the EAACI/GA*LEN/EDE/WAO guideline regarding
the likelihood of using regular dosed fgAHs or systemic
steroids as a first-and/or second-line treatment. In
Germany, physicians familiar with the guideline were
less likely to use them [7].

Similar to the German study, the participants of our
study reported that high dosing of sgAHs is effective in
a higher percentage of patients when compared to regular doses [7]. But only few physicians use this approach
in real life as previously discussed.

As for third line therapy, the use of the combination
of sgAHs and leukotriene antagonists or H2 blockers
was reported only by few physicians, and one third of
them have satisfactory outcomes in their patients
(Table 5). Pediatricians used montelukast more frequently than other groups, probably because they are familiar with this drug from treating asthma and rhinitis.

In our study only around 15% of physicians have experience with immunosuppressive drugs and omalizumab, D/A being the most experienced group. It is
interesting that physicians familiar with the EAACI/
GA°’LEN/EDE/WAO guideline prescribed omalizumab
more frequently. Omalizumab was approved for CsU in
2014 in our country. In another study of our group
about omalizumab for CsU, we found that 77% of patients had a complete or partial response after treatment
of 3 months; however, 65.4% of patients did not
complete 3 months of treatment, likely owing to the cost
of omalizumab and it not being reimbursed by health insurance programs [20].

Limitations and strengths of the study

The validity and reliability of the original version of
the survey had not been reported, but the selection of
the items was developed using a rigorous method [9].
The present study did not intend to validate the
questionnaire. Consequently, face validity and reliability need to be established in a future study. Also, the
survey-based design may present reporting and recall
bias.

All results are specific for Ecuador and cannot be
generalized to other countries in the region given the
different healthcare systems and government funding,
changing probably the management of CsU between
countries.

In our country, patients can be attended at public hospitals, such as hospitals from the Social Security System
or the Ministry of Health, or private practices for
consultation. Public hospitals tend to have less time per
patient, and in the case of chronic urticaria, it is wellknown that physicians need more time with these
patients for a good consultation (approx.30 min). Consultations of less than 10 min are unacceptable and do
not allow for adequate patient care [21]. Studies suggest
approx. 18-20 min per patient should be available to
satisfy the patient and accomplish quality standards of
medical consultation and patient care [22, 23].

One group of the surveyed physicians was attending
medical meetings and conferences; their medical knowledge is more likely to be updated than the surveyed
group of physicians who do not attend continuing medical education meetings.

Also we cannot compare one to one our results with
the previous German study, since the distribution of specialties were different. In the German study, most of the
surveyed physicians were dermatologists (43%) and in
our study GPs (67.6%). This could explain some differences in the findings. Nevertheless, to the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study that explores CsU management in Latin-America and compares it with Europe.
Our results suggest that disparities in knowledge between
physicians from different countries could influence the
management of CsU. In a previous study, we reported differences between Latin American and European physicians in the management of asthma and the patientphysician relationship [24]. Another strength of our
study is the high rate of participants (m = 740), larger
than the calculated sample size. Also, because of the
high rate of participating GPs in our study, we could
identify a relevant lack of knowledge in CsU management among these physicians. The increased diffusion
of the current guidelines could improve the knowledge
of diagnostic and therapeutic management for CsU patients and could lead to improved outcomes and better
patient care.

Conclusion

This study is the first to describe guideline knowledge
and the real life management of CsU among physicians
in a Latin-American country. Of note, it showed a low
awareness of the current EAACI/GA*LEN/EDE/WAO
guideline; although there is significant number of patients with CsU. It also showed that only a limited number of physicians are using third level medication when
needed.

Our results suggest that differences in knowledge between physicians from different countries could influence
the management of CsU and this should be considered
and confirmed in future studies.

We believe that despite increasing efforts to disseminate knowledge and awareness of chronic urticaria, important information about management does not reach
the GPs and specialists. Awareness and knowledge of
chronic urticaria needs to increase especially among
GPs, because they are often the first physicians to be
consulted by patients, and the low knowledge of guidelines could influence CsU control and_ treatment,
delaying the consultation by the specialist.
