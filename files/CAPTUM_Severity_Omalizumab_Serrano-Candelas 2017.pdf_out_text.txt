Omalizumab (OmAb) is a humanized anti-IgE antibody approved for the treatment of chronic
spontaneous urticaria (CSU). OmAb‘s mechanism of action is known to include actions on free IgE
and on pre-bound IgE. However, OmAb is equally and rapidly effective against autoimmune and nonautoimmune urticaria where IgE involvement is not clear, suggesting the involvement of additional
mechanisms of action. In this study, we sought to investigate the ability of OmAb to inhibit mast
cell and basophil degranulation induced by sera from CSU patients. For this purpose, we performed
a comparison between the in vitro incubation of sera from CSU patients treated with OmAb and the
in vivo administration of OmAb in a clinical trial. We found that OmAb added in vitro to sera from
CSU patients did not modify the ability of the sera to induce cell degranulation. Similarly, the sera
from patients treated with OmAb in the context of the clinical trial who had a good clinical outcome
maintained the capacity to activate mast cells and basophils. Thus, we conclude that the beneficial
activity of OmAb does not correlate with the ability of patient sera to induce cell degranulation.

Omalizumab (OmAb) is a biological drug that specifically recognizes IgE at the same epitope where IgE is bound
to its high-affinity receptor, FceRI. In addition to its ability to sequester free IgE, it has been demonstrated that
OmAb is also capable of accelerating the dissociation of pre-bound IgE in basophils'. Our recent data suggest
that this also occurs in mast cells and confirm previous basophil data at physiological dose ranges (30-100 ug/
ml, 0.2-0.67 1M) in a time- and dose-dependent manner’. In these conditions, OmAb was able to inhibit early
IgE-triggered events, such as phosphorylation of PLCy, LAT and Syk, as well as phosphorylation of ERK and
later events, such as upregulation of CD63 and leukotriene synthesis*. This result explains the effects of OmAb on
sustained inflammation in asthmatic patients‘.

OmAb has recently been approved for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and has shown high rates of
complete control®. CSU is a severely disabling disease® defined by the spontaneous onset of wheals, with or without angioedema, persisting for >6 weeks. Despite its impact on patient quality of life and morbidity, CSU has an
elusive physiopathology’. It is widely accepted that CSU has an autoimmune component’, wherein dermal mast
cells and basophils in CSU patients are triggered by circulating IgE against autoantigens’, by IgG against FceRI'*"!
or by IgG against IgE itself'*, which would be present in the sera of CSU patients. These antibodies may eventually
activate mast cells and basophils, causing histamine release!! and increased expression of activation markers such

as CD63"? or CD203c'*. However, the presence of reactive IgE/IgG has not been observed in approximately half of
CSU patients, and, from a clinical standpoint, autoimmune and non-autoimmune CSU cases are indistinguishable from one another. In fact, OmAb is effective in the majority of CSU patients regardless of the presence or
absence of autoantibodies. Moreover, in some cases, OmAb is able to cause symptom remission in a very short
timeframe, which cannot be explained by the currently postulated mechanisms of action of OmAb®.

In an attempt to better understand the mechanisms of action of OmAb in CSU and, more importantly, to
better understand the pathophysiology of this disease, we studied the influence of OmAb on the ability of CSU
sera to activate mast cells and basophils. Our research was performed in two ways. First, we studied the effects of
OmAb addition in vitro by pre-incubating sera from CSU patients with OmAb and assessing its ability to modulate basophil and mast cell activation induced by such sera. Second, we determined whether the ability of sera
from CSU patients to activate mast cells and primary basophils is altered after OmAb treatment in the context of a
clinical trial. We also evaluated whether the levels of histamine, tryptase and C-reactive protein in sera from CSU
patients change during treatment to evaluate their use as potential markers for the efficacy of OmAb treatment.

Results

Sera from CSU patients differentially induce mast and basophil celldegranulation. Thirty-nine
CSU patients (22 women and 17 men, mean age: 44 + 12.2 years) with a median disease duration of 6.7 years were
enrolled in the study. Sera from all patients were collected at the beginning of the study. To determine the activating capacity of sera from these CSU patients, we assessed its capacity to induce mast cell and basophil degranulation by analyzing CD63 expression on mast cells (LAD2) and basophils of healthy donors by flow cytometry using
the basophil activation test (BAT)'*. Our results revealed that mast cell and basophil sera-dependent degranulation follows the same pattern (Fig. 1) (Pearson's coefficient 0.730; p-value 8.76 x 10~*). However, the ability of
sera from CSU patients to induce cell degranulation is very heterogeneous among different sera. Importantly, this
degree of variability in the cell response to sera activity is not attributable to clinical differences between patients.

Sera from CSU patients incubated with OmAb in vitro do not inhibit cell degranulation. To test
the ability of OmAb to sequester soluble factors present in CSU or to hinder their activating capacity, we selected
several CSU sera able to induce cell degranulation of LAD2 cells and basophils and treated them with different
concentrations of OmAb or human IgG (hIgG) as a control (Fig. 2A). These pre-treated sera were subsequently
incubated with LAD2 mast cells or primary basophils, and CD63 surface expression was evaluated. Our results
showed that OmAb does not inhibit the ability of these sera to induce degranulation of LAD2 cells (Fig. 2B) or
primary basophils (Fig. 2C). To test whether OmAb was fully active (i.e., able to sequester soluble IgE), the same
OmAb concentrations and procedures were used with IgE® and subsequent triggering with streptavidin (STV),
achieving a near total inhibition of mast cell degranulation (Fig. 2D,E).

Altogether, our data indicate that OmAb effectively prevents IgE from binding to FceRI, preventing
IgE-mediated cell degranulation, but is unable to inhibit CSU patient sera-dependent degranulation in mast cells
and basophils under the same conditions.

Clinical outcomes from the OmAb clinical trial. Of the 39 CSU patients enrolled in the study
(Supplementary Table 1), seventeen patients were recruited to participate in a clinical trial to analyze the efficacy
of OmAb in the treatment of CSU. Fig. 3A shows a brief scheme of the clinical trial design, which was structured
as a cross-over study. Of these 17 patients (retention rate: 85%), 10 started in the OmAb arm (Arm A) and 7
started in the placebo arm (Arm B). The mean patient age was 46.7 (SD: 12.5) years, and 9 (52.9%) were women.

The Urticaria Activity Score (UAS) changes from baseline to the end of the study revealed a greater average improvement in response to OmAb treatment (mean UAS reduction = —2.4, SD = 2.5; median UAS reduction = —2; p25 = —4, p75 =0) than in response to placebo (mean UAS reduction = —1.2, SD = 2.6; median UAS
reduction = —2; p25 = —3, p75 = 1); however, the difference between the placebo and OmAb treatment groups
was not statistically significant (p = 0.380). In contrast, OmAb treatment resulted in a statistically significant
improvement in the post-treatment UAS compared with the baseline UAS (baseline UAS: 3; p25 =2, p75 =6;
post-OmAb UAS: 0; p25 =0, p75 = 2; p=0.004) (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Table 2A,B).

Comparisons of the change in the chronic urticaria quality of life (CU-Q,OL) score from baseline to the end of
the study showed a greater average improvement with OmAb treatment (mean overall score reduction = — 13.0,
SD = 22.0; median overall score reduction = —5.4; p25 = —29.3, p75 = 1.1) than with placebo (mean score reduction = —7.0, SD = 15.0; median overall score reduction = —4.9; p25 = — 16.8, p75 = 3.3), although the difference
was not statistically significant (p = 0.339). OmAb treatment resulted in a statistically significant improvement
in the post-treatment score compared with the baseline score (baseline overall score: 22.8; p25 = 8.7, p75 = 34.8;
post-OmAb treatment overall score: 6.5; p25 = 3.3, p75 = 15.2; p= 0.047) (Fig. 3C; Supplementary Table 2A,B).

The comparison between the change in the visual analogue scale (VAS) score from baseline to the end of
the study showed a greater average improvement with OmAb treatment (mean VAS reduction = —29.8,
SD = 29.4; median VAS reduction = —23; p25 = —53, p75 = —7) than with placebo (mean VAS reduction = —9.5,
SD = 41.7; median VAS reduction = —11; p25 = —45, p75 = 21), but the difference was not statistically significant
(p=0.218). OmAb resulted in a significantly improved VAS score post-treatment compared with baseline (baseline VAS: 60; p25 = 25, p75 =75; post-OmAb VAS: 10; p25=1, p75 = 29; p=0.001) (Fig. 3D; Supplementary
Table 2A,B).

Sera from CSU patients from the clinical trial maintained its ability to activate mast cells and
basophils. The results described above indicate that although OmAb treatment showed high efficacy in
the control of CSU, incubation of sera from CSU patients with OmAb in vitro did not hinder the ability of the
sera to activate mast cells (LAD2) and basophils. For this reason, we aimed to determine whether the in vivo

CSU sera), after the first treatment (corresponding to week 18) and after the second treatment (corresponding to
week 40).

We incubated these CSU sera samples with LAD2 mast cells and basophils and evaluated their activating
capacity by measuring CD63 by flow cytometry (Fig. 4A). Our results show that their sera maintained the same
activating capacity for mast cells (Fig. 4B) and basophils (Fig. 4C) throughout the study. It is important to note

 

SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 7: 8985 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-09361-4 6
 

www.nature.com/scientificreports/

that all patients, regardless of the ability of their serum to activate basophils and mast cells, had similar positive
clinical outcomes with OmAb treatment.

These results show that the capacity of CSU sera to activate mast cells and basophils is not a good marker for
predicting the clinical response to OmAb treatment.

The histamine, tryptase and C-reactive protein levels present in the sera of CSU patients are
maintained following OmAb treatment. Because the analysis of the activating capacity of sera from
CSU patients for mast cells and basophils was not useful for predicting the response to OmAb treatment, we
sought to determine whether other potential mediators or proinflammatory markers present in the sera changed
during treatment, as they may serve as markers of symptom remission. We evaluated the levels of histamine,
tryptase and C-reactive protein in sera from CSU patients during treatment. As shown in Fig. 5, sera from CSU
patients initially contained variable amounts of these substances, which had no correlation with clinical outcome,
and the amounts of these soluble factors did not vary throughout the treatment course. Moreover, the concentrations of these markers did not seem to be correlated with each other (Fig. 5D).

Other standard practices reported in the literature include the evaluation of the 3-hexosaminidase activity
of cell supernatants after incubation of CSU sera with mast cells!” !*. Given the results found for histamine, we
sought to evaluate the 3-hexosaminidase content in sera from CSU patients compared with that in sera from
healthy controls. We found that both sera samples had considerable intrinsic enzymatic activity (Supplementary
Fig. S1A). Moreover, the evaluation of 3-hexosaminidase content in CSU samples during treatment showed no
change with either OmAb or placebo treatment (Supplementary Fig. $1B). Thus, we concluded that this colorimetric approach to measuring cell degranulation is not valid to assess sera-dependent mast cell degranulation.
Moreover, the variability in sera colors, despite subtraction of the background, can also alter the assay results.

Discussion

OmAb has been postulated to be effective in the treatment of CSU due to its ability to sequester free IgE and,
indirectly, to downregulate FceRI'*-*!. Benefits of omalizumab treatment (300 mg) are commonly evident early
(before week 4) in CSU patients and persisted to week 24° ?*:?°. However, in some cases its clinical effectiveness
is evident much earlier than downregulation of the IgE receptor could take place, given that there are patients
whose symptoms resolve as early as 24 or 48h after OmAb administration™*”. In certain cases, the effectiveness
of OmAb is thought to be associated with the blocking of autoreactive IgE antibodies’, although the presence of
these autoantibodies cannot be found in all CSU patients. In a recent review is summarized that OmAb therapy is
successful in patients with or without a positive test for IgG autoantibodies against FceRI or IgE, or IgE autoantibodies against thyroperoxidase”’. In this study, we aimed to further explore the action of OmAb in CSU patients
and to better understand the pathophysiology of this disease.

We first explored the capacity of sera from CSU patients to activate mast cells (LAD2) and primary basophils.
It has been reported that between 5 and 10% of CSU patients present with specific autoantibodies against IgE
itself'* °°, Using LAD2 cells as a mast cell model permits the uniform evaluation of serum activation in a context
where FceRI is not occupied. Therefore, this model allows us to discard anti-IgE antibodies as the soluble factor
present in the sera responsible for cell degranulation, as LAD2 cells are not IgE-sensitized.

To explore the action of OmAb in CSU patients, we analyzed the ability of OmAb to block the serum-activating
ability of sera from CSU patients to induce mast cell (LAD2) and basophil degranulation. We used ranges of
OmAb doses close to physiological concentrations in vitro for comparison with the data obtained from the sera
from CSU patients treated with OmAb in a clinical trial.

From our in vitro experiments, we can conclude that OmAb did not interfere with or block the serum factor
or antibody responsible for activating mast cells and basophils. This result highlights the fact that IgE is not the
activating factor present in the sera from our patients. Consistent with this result, the use of quilizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the M1-prime segment of the IgE membrane causing IgE-switch depletion and cell
apoptosis, did not prove to be effective in a clinical trial involving 45 patients with CSU”’.

We next analyzed the efficacy of OmAb in the treatment of CSU in a clinical trial. OmAb treatment was efficacious in all CSU subtypes, regardless of their autoimmune and non-autoimmune behavior, defined as the ability
of the sera to activate basophils and mast cells. Consistent with these findings, it has been recently published that
serum reactivity can be useful for predicting the time to response to OmAb*. The authors concluded that patients
with a positive autologous skin serum test (ASST) respond faster to OmAb, but they determined that the final
OmAb efficacy did not depend on the result of the ASST, which is in accordance with our results demonstrating
no differences in OmAb effectiveness regardless of the activating capacity of sera from the patients enrolled in the
clinical trial. This result is in accordance with the clinical experience of others” *°. Our study shows a statistical
significant difference between the baseline to OmAb post-treatment. However there is not significant difference
between placebo and OmAb treatment although we observed a clear improvement. While not statistically significant, the magnitude of this improvement may have clinical relevance and should not lead these results to be
discarded. The residual effect of OmAb in the Arm A/A’ may have contributed to alter significance. In addition,
the impact of the placebo effect should not be discounted. This symptom reduction in the placebo group has also
been observed in other OmAb efficacy studies that evaluated the mean change from baseline in symptom scores?.

Our results also reveal that the activating capacity of sera from CSU patients did not change after treatment
with OmAb. This result is in accordance with that of other studies that did not reveal changes in ASST in CSU
patients during remission*"». In the proof of concept study for the use of OmAb in CSU, Kaplan’ treated 12 CSU
patients and analyzed the ability of sera to activate basophils before and after administering OmAb. In patients
with complete resolution of or remitted symptoms, they observed a trend toward the induction of a lower histamine release than that resulting from the same sera at the beginning of the treatment. However, they did not find a
clear correlation between symptom remission and serum activity, with patients who exhibited complete responses

maintaining the same serum activity and vice versa. Moreover, as we will discuss below, the analysis of histamine
release can yield artificial results due to the serum content of histamine in these patients.

Finally, we also describe the intrinsic levels of the soluble mediators 8-hexosaminidase, histamine, tryptase
and C-reactive protein in the sera from CSU patients. The concentrations of these soluble factors were not
observed to be associated with either the clinical outcomes or the responses to treatment. We conclude that the
use of 3-hexosaminidase analysis to determine the ability of patient sera to induce mast cell degranulation could

result in artificial values that are determined more by sera activity than by cell activity itself. These results also call
into question the use of the ASST in the evaluation of autoimmune CSU patients, as soluble factors such bradykinin, complement fragments or cytokines may trigger skin mast cell activation and yield false-positive results”.

We should also consider that removal of IgE from the mast cell and basophil surface may desensitize them
and would leave them unable to be activated by IgE or anti-IgE autoreactive antibodies. However, IgE or anti-IgE
antibodies are not the unique cause of CSU symptoms and that OmAb is acting through other mechanisms.
As highlighted by a recent comprehensive review"”, there could be alternative mechanisms. Accordingly, it has
been demonstrated that OmAb is also effective in several types of inducible urticaria, as solar urticaria**,
cold- and heat-induced urticaria**** and delayed pressure urticaria or symptomatic dermographism™ “° where
non-IgE-mechanisms have been demonstrated, indicating that OmAb may act beyond IgE-mediated mechanisms. We have recently published a review in which we discuss the action of OmAb cells other than mast cells
and basophils“’. For example, OmAb can target membrane-IgE (mlgE) in IgE* B-cells, reducing IL4R expression
and IgE synthesis and decreasing the number of these cells, possibly by causing B-cell anergy**. OmAb has also
been reported to cause eosinophil apoptosis”, a finding that is in agreement with the decrease in eosinophilia
found in asthma patients after OmAb administration“. Finally, OmAb has been observed to inhibit corneal angiogenesis in IgE-deficient mice, but it failed to inhibit angiogenesis in Fcgr1—/— mice, suggesting a role of OmAb
as an IgG.

In conclusion, our data show that OmAb efficacy in cases of CSU is not explained by the inhibition of sera
activity in mast cells and basophils and indirectly proves that autoimmunity, understood as the ability of CSU
sera to activate basophils and mast cells, is not a good biomarker for predicting clinical CSU responses to OmAb
treatment. We also conclude that proinflammatory components present in sera from CSU patients are not useful
for predicting OmAb treatment responses. Moreover, these results also suggest a possible direct effect of OmAb,
not only in mast cells and basophils but also in other cells, which could explain its effectiveness in CSU and other
pathologies.

Methods
This study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Navarra. The clinical trial was
approved by the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medicinal Products (AEMPS).

Cells and reagents. The LAD2 human mast cell line was provided by Drs A. Kirshenbaum and D.D. Metcalfe
(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and grown in StemPro-34 serum-free medium (Invitrogen Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with StemPro-34 Nutrient, L-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100
U/ml), streptomycin (100,:g/ml), and 100 ng/ml recombinant stem cell factor (SCF) (Amgen, Thousand Oaks,
CA, USA). The experiments with basophils were performed as previously reported** using blood from non-atopic
donors. Biotinylated human IgE (IgE®) was obtained from Abbiotec (San Diego, CA, USA). Streptavidin
(STV) was purchased from Sigma (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Whole-molecule human hlgG was obtained
from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA, USA). PerCP-Cy5.5-conjugated anti-human HLA-DR and
PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-human CD123 antibodies were purchased from eBioscience (San Diego, CA, USA), and
APC-conjugated anti-human CD203c and PE-conjugated anti-human CD63 antibodies were purchased from BD
Bioscience (Mountain View, CA).

CSU patients. ‘Thirty-nine patients were enrolled in this study. All patients had been diagnosed with a
2-month to 40-year history of CSU, and 31 (79%) suffered from angioedema along with urticaria. Supplementary
Table 1 in the online supporting information includes demographic and clinical data of these patients. All patients
provided their written consent to participate in this study, and 17 (43.5%) were included in the clinical trial
described below.

Ethics statement. The study design and protocol was approved by the Food and Drug Spanish Agency
(AEMPS), the State Ethics Committee and the Ethics Research Committee of the University of Navarra. The
authors performed these procedures in accordance with the approved guidelines, obtaining informed consent
from each subject before conducting the experiments.

Mast cell and basophil activation with sera from CSU patients. LAD2 cells (0.2 x 10°) were
re-suspended in Tyrode's buffer” and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C with 251] of sera from CSU patients in a
final volume of 60 1. Cells were collected for CD63 testing using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (FACScan; BD
Biosciences). A total of 100 ul of blood from healthy donors was pre-incubated with 20 ul of stimulation buffer
containing IL-3 at 37°C for 10 minutes. Thereafter, blood was stimulated with 80 ul of sera. After 30 min at 37°C,
stimulation was stopped and the serum was eliminated by washing the samples with cold washing buffer (PBS,
2mM EDTA). Samples were stained with HLA-DR, PerCP-Cy5.5, CD123 PE-Cy7, CD203c APC and CD63 PE
for 30 min at 4°C. Erythrocytes were lysed for 15 min at RT, and samples were washed twice prior to separating
them in a FASCCanto II flow cytometer (FACScan). Data were analyzed with FlowJo Tree Star software (Ashland,
OR, USA). In all cases, dead cells were eliminated based on their forward (FSC) and side scattering (SSC) profiles.

In vitro preincubation of sera from CSU patients or IgE with OmAb/IgG and LAD2 and primary
basophil stimulation. Sera from CSU patients were treated for 30 min at 37°C with OmAb or higG, as an
immunoglobulin control, at different concentrations in Tyrode’s buffer. Then, LAD2 cells and basophils from
donors were stimulated with these pre-treated sera as described above, and CD63 was assessed by flow cytometry.
For IgE-dependent LAD2 degranulation, biotinylated IgE (IgE®) was incubated with different concentrations of
OmAb/hIgG for 30 min at 37°C. Then, LAD2 mast cells were incubated overnight with this mixture at 37°C, and,
after extensive washing, cells were stimulated with streptavidin for 30 min. CD63 was assessed by flow cytometry.

Clinical trial. The multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over clinical trial
of OmAb was registered at Clinical Trials.gov (NCT01713725). Twenty participants were recruited from those
included in the study. These patients were randomly assigned to receive OmAb or a matching placebo for a total
of 14 weeks (first period). A total of 300 mg of OmAb was subcutaneously administered every two weeks during
the first four weeks and every 4 weeks thereafter. After a washout period of 4 weeks, patients were crossed over to
the other treatment for an additional 14 weeks (second period). Patients were followed-up for 12 weeks after the
end of the second period.

Disease activity and quality of life assessment. The urticaria activity score (UAS) was used to evaluate
the main CSU characteristics (pruritus and number of wheals), with a total daily score ranging from 0 to 6 (lowest
to highest disease activity)’. The validated Spanish version of the Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire
(CU-Q,OL) was used to measure 6 CSU-specific dimensions of health-related quality of life: pruritus (2 items),
impact on life activities (6 items), sleep disorders (5 items), limitations (3 items), appearance (5 items), and swelling (2 items)*’. Scores were transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores representing a worse quality of
life. Additionally, the visual analogue scale (VAS) was used as a complementary measure of CSU severity. The
VAS score was determined by measuring the distance in millimeters (mm) between the left corner of a straight,
100-mm horizontal line and the mark indicated on the line by each patient.

LAD2 and primary basophil stimulation with sera from CSU patients treated with OmAb/
Placebo. Patient sera samples from the clinical trial phases were obtained at the start of the study, after administering 5 OmAb or placebo doses (week 18) and at the end of the study (week 40). These sera samples were used
to assess cell degranulation of mast cells and basophils as detailed above.

Measurement of soluble substances in sera from CSU patients. Histamine, tryptase and C-reactive
protein levels in sera were measured using the EIA Histamine kit (Immunotech, BeckmanCoulter, Marseille,
France), the enzyme immunoassay ImmunoCAP FEIA (Thermo Fisher, Uppsala, Sweden) and the C-reactive
protein High Sensitivity immunoturbidimetric assay (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), respectively,
following the manufacturers’ instructions. Measurement of intrinsic }-hexosaminidase from CSU sera was performed by incubating sera with substrate (p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-3-D-glucopyranoside) for 30 min and, after
stopping the reaction, measuring the absorbance at 405 nm.

 

 

Statistical data analysis. The results of the in vitro assays are expressed as the means + standard deviations of the mean value (SD). One-way ANOVA or unpaired t-tests were used to determine significant differences (p-value), and Pearson's coefficient was used to analyze the correlation between different parameters
using GraphPad software. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test was used to compare efficacy parameters
according to interventions using Stata 14 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). Asterisks indicate the following p
values: *p < 0.05, **p <0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001.
