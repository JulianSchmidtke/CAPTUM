Introduction: Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized anti-IgE monoclonal antibody,
approved for patients affected by chronic spontaneous urticaria resistant to antihistamines.
Although the clinical benefit of omalizumab has been established in several clinical trials,
there are very little data about long-term treatment with this drug and real-life reports
regarding its use in patients affected by comorbidities other than urticaria are lacking.
Objectives: To assess omalizumab efficacy and safety in a heterogeneous population of
patients affected by chronic spontaneous urticaria and several comorbidities in a real-world
setting.

Materials and methods: Patients affected by chronic spontaneous urticaria with weekly
urticaria activity score >16 resistant to antihistamines were treated with omalizumab 300 mg
injection as add-on to H1-antihistamines administered every 4 weeks for 6 months. Clinical
assessment of weekly urticaria activity score, dermatology life quality index and blood tests
were performed at baseline, 12, 24 and 52 weeks of treatment. Response was assessed based
on reduction weekly urticaria activity score.

Results: Thirty-two patients (22F; 10M) with a mean age of 52.4 years (range 27—72)
affected by chronic spontaneous urticaria were enrolled. Comorbidities affecting our study
population were divided into 6 categories: cardio-metabolic (77%), oncologic (19%), infectious (16%), allergic (45%) immunologic (41%) and others (18%). Omalizumab determined
a satisfactory reduction of symptoms of chronic spontaneous urticaria and an amelioration of
quality of life within our population. No relevant alterations regarding patients’ underlying
conditions were encountered. This is the first study regarding the use of omalizumab for
chronic spontaneous urticaria in a population of adult patients affected by several comorbidities, eg, cardio-metabolic, oncologic, infectious, allergic, immunologic and psychiatric
diseases. Real-life data represent a valuable source of information about a drug’s safety
and efficacy profile, especially in patients affected by different comorbidities that are widely
diffused in Western countries.

Keywords: chronic spontaneous urticaria, omalizumab, oncologic, cardiovascular, allergic

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a condition characterized by the presence of
wheals lasting for more than 6 weeks, variably associated with the presence of
angioedema.'* CSU is the most common type of urticaria and affects about 1% of the
population, causing a notable deterioration in the patient’s quality of life and bearing a
substantial social and health care burden.*° The presence of angioedema in patients

affected by CSU has been associated with a prolonged disease
duration compared with those experiencing wheals only.’
CSU is twice as common in women as in men, and most
commonly affects patients aged 20-40 years.** Unlike inducible urticaria, which is provoked by a variety of physical
stimuli (cold, heat, pressure, etc.), its exact nosology is still
not fully elucidated. The release of histamine from mast cells
in the skin is considered a key factor in its pathogenesis.2*"!°
A role of functional autoantibodies against the high-affinity
immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor and other autoantibodies
such as anti-thyroperoxidase has been _postulated.*'!
Although modern second-generation H1-antihistamines are
the standard of care for patients with CSU, adjunctive treatments may be required for effective control of symptoms in
many patients.* Omalizumab is a humanized IgG1k monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to free human IgE, firstly
indicated for the treatment of allergy-induced asthma.'*!> In
2014, FDA approved omalizumab also for patients affected by
CSU aged 12 years or older who continue to have symptoms
despite antihistamines treatment. Omalizumab represents the
first biologic medicine and the first new class of pharmacological agent approved for CSU since the introduction of nonsedating H1-antihistamines and it is available in Italy since
2015. Randomized controlled trials showed a good safety and
tolerability profile in patients affected by CSU.'*!© However,
safety data of long-term treatment with this biologic drug are
scarce and real-life reports regarding its use in patients affected
by comorbidities other than CSU are lacking. We hereby
present our experience with the use of omalizumab in a
heterogeneous Italian population of patients affected by CSU
and other different comorbidities in a real-life setting.

Materials and methods

This study is a retrospective analysis of data collected at
the Urticaria Clinic of the Dermatology Department of
Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy. Written informed
consent was obtained from all patients included in the
study. In view of the retrospective nature of the study,
only a notification to the Ethical Committee of the investigator Center (Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy) was
required and submitted. Patients aged >18 years affected
by moderate-to-severe CSU [defined as weekly Urticaria
Activity Score (UAS7) >28], who remained symptomatic
despite Hl-antihistamines at up to 4 times the licensed
dose, were included in the study. Medical history, presence

test, IgE level assessment [PRIST]) were performed at
BaseLine (BL), 12 weeks (W12), 24 weeks (W24) and
52 weeks (W52) of therapy. Patients received 300 mg
subcutaneous injection as add-on to H1-antihistamines
administered every 4 weeks for 6 months, followed by
an 8-week treatment interruption. In case of recurrence, a
second cycle of 5 additional doses of omalizumab 300 mg
every 4 weeks (5 months) had been administered. Clinical
response was assessed based on reduction of UAS-7 [outcomes were classified as complete (=0), partial (=0—28) or
no response (>28)] and DLQI [outcomes were classified as
complete (<6), partial (6-10) or no response (>10)]. Safety
has been monitored performing blood and instrumental
tests.

Results

A total of 32 patients (22 F;10 M) with mean age of 52.4
years (range 27—72) affected by CSU were enrolled. Mean
duration of urticaria symptoms before treatment with omalizumab was 7 years (range 140). Three out of the enrolled
patients were diagnosed with concomitant inducible urticaria
(CIndU) triggered by physical activity, cold and UV light,
respectively. Ten patients reported angioedema concurrently
with itch and wheals. Comorbidities affecting our study
population were divided into 6 categories, as reported in
Table 1. Thirteen patients completed 2 cycles of treatment
(13 months), while 10 patients had completed | cycle of
treatment (6 months) and 8 patients had undergone 12
weeks (1/2 cycle) of treatment to date. One patient stopped
the treatment because of increased arterial blood pressure
after 24 weeks of treatment, whilst one other patient experienced acute ischemic heart disease (NSTEMI myocardial
infarction) not leading to discontinuation. One patient
reported generalized arthralgia and myalgia immediately
after the first injection but not following subsequential injections. One patient referred regular episodes of fatigue and
sleepiness the day after omalizumab injections, not leading to
treatment discontinuation. Mild, transient local skin immediate reactions were observed in one patient. No cases of
anaphylaxis or serious adverse events were reported in our
patients. Twenty patients added second-generation H1-antihistamines to omalizumab because of persistence of pruritus
and wheals after 2-4 weeks of treatment with omalizumab in
monotherapy. Two patients affected by atopic dermatitis
received methotrexate 15mg/week during treatment with

Discussion
This observational study investigated the effect of omalizumab administered to a population of patients simultaneously affected by CSU and cardiometabolic, oncologic,
infectious, immunologic and psychiatric comorbidities. To
our knowledge, this is the first real-life report regarding the
use of this anti-[gE antibody in such “complex” patients.
Alongside with data reported in literature, we observed
a very low discontinuation rate due to AEs (0.32%).!7"'°

marketing surveillance showed that hypersensitivity reactions to the drug are infrequent and anaphylaxis is rare.”°

In our cohort, two patients with a history of previous
Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)-related hepatitis are successfully
treated and their viral load did not change during therapy,
suggesting that there is no risk of HCV exacerbation. The
HCV infection did not seem to diminish the efficacy of
omalizumab in this subset of patients. Only few cases of
patients undergoing treatment with omalizumab with concurrent infection by hepatotropic virus, in particular,
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and C virus, have been reported
to date.2'3 In all patients, no side effects or infection
worsening were documented, with concurrent substantial
improvement of symptoms of asthma or urticaria. A
decrease in the viral load was detected in a patient with
active infection by HBV. A case of a patient with

cytomegalic hepatitis treated with valganciclovir and omalizumab for CSU described remission of the infective
symptoms and good control of CSU.* These reports suggest that omalizumab is safe in terms of liver function.

In our cohort, we did not observe a higher incidence of
viral infections during treatment with omalizumab. While
a higher incidence of nasopharyngitis, influenza, upper
respiratory tract infection in children treated with omalizumab has been reported in the literature, other authors
observed a decrease in the duration of rhinovirus infections, viral shedding and risk of rhinovirus illnesses,
hypothesizing a role of the anti-[gE agent in improving
virus-induced IFN-alpha response.?>?7

Although IgE blockade may theoretically impair the
immune control of parasites, we did not report any case
of parasitic infections. Our findings align with the overall
low risk of parasitic infections reported in RCTs and in
observational studies.**”°

One case of acute ischemic heart disease not leading to
discontinuation was reported in our cohort. No patient
reported bleeding or thrombosis. Only one patient, a
post-menopausal female aged 54, interrupted the therapy
because of an increase in arterial blood pressure 6 months
after treatment. Bisoprolol was administered with good
control of symptoms. On the other hand, our series
includes other 9 patients with preexisting arterial hypertension, who underwent treatment with omalizumab without any complication or significant alteration of blood
pressure value.

observational study on asthma patients, a higher rate of
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular serious AEs (arterial
and venous thrombosis) was noticed compared to no-treated
patients.*° A real-life retrospective analysis asthma patients
treated with omalizumab for uncontrolled severe asthma
reported one case of venous thrombosis not leading to discontinuation of therapy.” Surveillance is advisable owing to
the apparently very low frequency of these AEs. The higher
incidence of arterial hypertension in asthma patients is well
documented, as well as its association with obesity and the
overall increased cardiovascular risk of patients affected by
asthma.*!*> On the contrary, cardiovascular risk does not
seem to be increased in patients affected by csu.

Our data-set included one patient with chronic renal
failure (CRF). Regular laboratory, clinical and instrumental assessments did not show any significant modification.
The patient obtained a satisfactory control of symptoms of
CSU without any worsening of his general conditions.

Our series includes 7 patients with a history of previous
cancer (see Table 1). All of them were regularly monitored
with physical examination, blood and instrumental tests as
recommended by their referral physicians. These patients had
been monitored from BL for a medium range of 12 months,
without any known neoplastic recurrence or progression.
These results are consistent with literature data, showing
that treatment with omalizumab was not associated with an
increased risk of malignancies.*> Our findings may further
support the idea that omalizumab treatment is safe also in
patients with previous cancers, as it does not seem to increase
the risk of relapse. Long-term real-life data on a larger
population are needed in order to further confirm this
hypothesis.

Two patients of our series were affected by both CSU
and severe atopic dermatitis (AD). They were treated with
methotrexate (15 mg/week) and concurrently started omalizumab treatment, with satisfying results. Observational
studies of omalizumab for AD, in general, report more
positive results compared to the RCTs.*° The interpretation of improvement as an effect of treatment should
accommodate the fact that most patients with AD (75%)
have a spontaneous remission of disease before
adolescence.*” Thus, recommendation for use in clinical
practice awaits evidence from larger randomized controlled trials.

Our patients affected by immunoallergic comorbidities

Regarding psychiatric specific

assessment has been performed during treatment.
However, we did not observe any worsening of clinical
symptoms. From the other hand, DLQI of both patients
who were affected or not by psychiatric comorbidities was
significantly reduced during treatment with omalizumab,
suggesting that mental health of CSU patients may benefit
from the improvement of clinical symptoms.

Relevant limitations of our study are the small sample,
the lack of controls and the relatively short period of followup (average 12 months). Observation of this cohort of
patients over time may represent an interesting source of
information about omalizumab safety profile. The main
strength of our work is the heterogeneity of comorbidities
affecting our population. These diseases are widely diffused
in Western countries; however, safety data on affected
patients are commonly not available from RCTs, owing to
their exclusion criteria. Data from real-life observational
studies therefore represent a valuable source of information
for clinicians who have to deal with “complex” patients still
needing treatment for CSU. In our study, we focused on the
safety profile of omalizumab in such patients. Given the
heterogeneity of comorbidities and related classes of medications, interactions between such drugs and omalizumab
were not analyzed in our population. Investigating the possible drug interactions between omalizumab and other concomitant medications and the possible influence of the latter
on the response to omalizumab represents a very fertile field
for future research.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that omalizumab may be considered as a
safe and well-tolerated therapeutic option even in patients

affected by several comorbidities. Further analysis based on
a larger cohort of patients and a longer period of treatment is
required to confirm our preliminary observations.
