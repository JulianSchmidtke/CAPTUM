Background: Omalizumab, a humanized anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, proved efficacious and well
tolerated in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) refractory to H; antihistamines (H)AH) in
the POLARIS study (NCT02329223), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in East Asian
patients. However, data in Japanese patients, who have specific baseline characteristics (e.g., low
angioedema incidence, different background medications) that may impact clinical outcomes, are lacking. This pre-specified analysis presents additional patient-level data over time, pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamics data for omalizumab and IgE, and efficacy and safety data for omalizumab in Japanese patients.
Methods: Japanese patients (N = 105) were randomized 1:1:1 to omalizumab 300 mg, 150 mg, or placebo by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks. Efficacy and safety were assessed primarily based on
changes from baseline to Week 12 in weekly itch-severity scores (ISS7) and weekly urticaria activity
scores (UAS7), and incidence of adverse events (AEs), respectively. Patient-level UAS7 data over time
were also reviewed.
Results: At Week 12, least squares mean (LSM) changes from baseline in ISS7 were greater with omalizumab vs. placebo (—9.54 and —7.29 for omalizumab 300 mg and 150 mg, respectively, vs. placebo
[-5.17]). Corresponding LSM changes from baseline in UAS7 were —21.61 and —15.59 (vs. placebo
[-—10.88]). Most responders in the omalizumab 300 mg group displayed improvement of disease activity
within 2—4 weeks and had well-controlled symptoms during the treatment period. Overall AE incidence
was similar across treatment arms.
Conclusions: This subgroup analysis demonstrated that omalizumab is a well-tolerated, beneficial option
for treatment of CSU in HjAH-refractory Japanese patients.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), also referred to as chronic
idiopathic urticaria (CIU), is a highly prevalent skin disorder,
affecting up to 1% of the population at any time.' CSU is characterized by the sudden development of wheals (hives) and/or
angioedema lasting for 6 weeks or more.'* The peak incidence of
CSU occurs in individuals aged 20—40 years, with the disease
affecting individuals for 1-5 years and being more common in
women than in men.' Because CSU has a significant negative
impact on patients’ quality of life, with patients experiencing sleep
deprivation and higher rates of psychiatric comorbidity than the
general population,'’* the key aim of treatment is complete
symptom control.”

Urticaria is one of the most common skin disorders in Japan,
according to a study of skin disorders in patients attending
dermatology clinics in Japan.” The Japanese Dermatology Association (JDA) treatment guideline that was published in 2011 classified
CSU as urticaria that develops daily and spontaneously for 1
month.°’ The age and gender distribution of CSU in Japanese patients is similar to that of a Caucasian population, but in Japanese
patients, the prevalence of CSU with concurrent angioedema
(11.0—20.0%)*° appears to be lower than the prevalence reported in
a Western population with CSU (40.7—53.1%).'° The JDA treatment
algorithm recommends a stepwise treatment approach: step 1 is
treatment with a standard dose of non- or low-sedative antihistamines; the dose may be increased up to 2-fold if symptoms
persist.’ However, clinical studies conducted in Japan have suggested that a certain proportion of patients remained symptomatic
despite antihistamine treatment (nearly 30% reported in Japan).'!
In fact, more than 40% of Japanese physicians were dissatisfied
with the first-line treatment,'* highlighting an unmet clinical need
for therapeutic options in the current CSU treatment strategy.

Omalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to
the C3 domain of immunoglobulin E (IgE), thereby reducing the
levels of free IgE and inhibiting the binding of IgE to its receptor on
mast cells and basophils, and diminishing IgE-mediated cellular
responses.'’ The safety and efficacy of omalizumab have been
demonstrated in the pivotal randomized clinical trials, ASTERIA I,
ASTERIA II and GLACIAL,'*~'° as well as a meta-analysis of 7 randomized clinical trials,'’ and omalizumab is now licensed in more
than 80 countries for the treatment of CSU. Omalizumab was also
approved for the indication of CSU by the Japanese Pharmaceuticals
Medical Device Agency in March 2017 and will be recommended in
the next treatment algorithm of the JDA guideline, which is
currently under revision.'®

The POLARIS study (NCT02329223)'° recently demonstrated the
efficacy and safety of omalizumab, compared with placebo, as an
add-on to H; antihistamine (H;AH) therapy in CSU patients who
remain symptomatic despite Hj;AH monotherapy in Japanese and
Korean patients.”° This POLARIS subgroup analysis provides deeper
insight into the efficacy and safety of omalizumab for the treatment
of persistent CSU symptoms in Japanese patients treated with nonsedating HjAH treatment. This report presents data from additional
analyses, including heatmap analysis to visualize individual patient
responses to treatment over time, and assessment of omalizumab
serum concentrations and changes in IgE serum levels to

 

characterize the pharmacokinetic and IgE pharmacodynamic profile of omalizumab in this patient population.

Methods
Study design and participants

The POLARIS study methodology has previously been described
in detail.”° Briefly, POLARIS was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter phase 3 study conducted at 41 sites (26 sites in Japan, 15 sites in Korea) between
December 2014 and December 2015. Following a 2-week screening
period, eligible patients were randomized 1:1:1 with the twocountry strata of Japan and Korea, using interactive response
technology (IRT), to omalizumab 300 mg or 150 mg or placebo by
subcutaneous administration every 4 weeks (days 1, 29 and 57).
After completing the 12-week treatment phase, patients were followed up for a further 12 weeks, during which time additional
efficacy and safety data were collected. Patients in the omalizumab
300 mg group received two subcutaneous injections (two 150-mg
vials), patients in the omalizumab 150 mg group received one injection (150-mg vial) each of omalizumab and placebo; the placebo
group received two injections (two 150-mg vials) of placebo. All site
personnel were blinded during the study until the final database
lock, except for authorized unblinded staff who were allowed
contact with the IRT and who dispensed and/or administered the
study drugs, but were not otherwise involved in the study conduct.
Patients took stable doses of their pre-screening H;AH medications
for the duration of the study and were provided diphenhydramine
for additional itch relief on an as-needed basis (<80 mg/day in
Japanese patients). The following medications were prohibited for
the duration of the study: anti-IgE therapy; routine doses of systemic corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil or cyclophosphamide;
intravenous IgG; plasmapheresis; regular oral doxepin; any H2
antihistamine (H2AH) or leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA);
any HjAH at greater than the approved doses; and inactivated
vaccinations (Supplementary Table 1).

POLARIS (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02329223)!° was conducted in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical
Practice guidelines.”'* Written informed consent was provided by
all patients prior to involvement in the trial. Patient anonymity was
preserved using methods approved by the Ethics Committees of all
participating institutions. Patients (male and female) aged 12—75
years with a diagnosis of CSU for >6 months that was refractory to
conventional H;AH at the time of randomization and who met all of
the following criteria were eligible for inclusion: itch and hives for
>8 consecutive weeks at any time prior to enrollment despite
current H,AH treatment during this period; urticaria activity score
(UAS)7 >16 and the itch component of UAS7 (range 0—21) >8
during the 7 days prior to randomization (day 1); in-clinic UAS >4
on at least one of the screening visit days (days —14, —7 or 1);
patients on an approved dose of an H,AH for CSU for >3 consecutive days immediately prior to the day —14 screening visit and
with documented current use on the day of the initial screening
visit. Key exclusion criteria were weight <20 kg, clearly defined

underlying etiology for chronic urticaria other than CSU, and any
skin diseases other than CSU with chronic itching.

Endpoints

In this pre-specified analysis, we present data for Japanese patients who were enrolled in the POLARIS study, whose primary
outcome was the change from baseline to Week 12 in the weekly
itch severity score (ISS7) (0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe).'*
Secondary outcomes were the change from baseline in UAS7 (range
0-42),7? weekly number of hives score (0, none; 1, 1-6 hives; 2,
7-12 hives; 3, >12 hives per 12 h),'“ percentage of participants with
UAS7 <6, weekly size of the largest hive score (0, none; 1, <1.25 cm;
2, 1.25-2.5 cm; 3, >2.5 cm),’* percentage of ISS7 minimally
important difference (MID) responders, percentage of complete
responders (UAS7 = 0) and the overall Dermatology Life Quality
Index (DLQI) score at Week 12.4 °° In addition, the incidence and
severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs, vital signs, and
clinical laboratory evaluations were determined; the presence of
anti-omalizumab antibodies was assessed in serum samples
collected at the end of the follow-up phase (Week 24). Blood
samples were collected to determine serum omalizumab concentrations, free IgE and total IgE at day 1 (pre-dose), Week 4 (prior to
the second dose), Week 12 (end of randomized treatment, i.e., 4
weeks after the last dose), and Week 24 (end of post-treatment
follow-up, i.e., 16 weeks after the last dose).

For the duration of the study, patients recorded symptoms using
an electronic hand-held device (eDiary).?**° The number and intensity of hives were reported in the morning and evening. The
average daily scores were totaled each week to evaluate ISS7, the
weekly number of hives score and the weekly composite outcome,
UAS7. The largest hive was also measured twice daily. ISS7 MID
response was defined as a >5-points reduction from baseline in
Iss7.?

Evaluation of omalizumab, free and total IgE in serum

Serum omalizumab was determined by a validated enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as previously described,””
with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 28 ng/mL. Free
serum IgE was determined using a previously reported validated
ELISA with a LLOQ of 2 ng/mL and upper limit of quantification
(ULOQ) of 150 ng/mL.?°7° A commercially available immunoassay
on the ImmunoCAP® (Quest Diagnostics, Madison, NJ, USA) platform was used to measure the serum concentrations of total IgE
(i.e., the sum of free and omalizumab-bound IgE), with a LLOQ of
4.48 ng/mL. Serum concentrations of omalizumab, free IgE, and
total IgE were summarized by descriptive statistics by treatment
group and visit. Values below the LLOQ for omalizumab and total
IgE were included as zero in the summary statistics. For free IgE,
values below the LLOQ and above the ULOQ were not considered
for the summary statistics. Change from baseline for free and total
IgE were also summarized by treatment group and patient visits
were analyzed according to the actual treatment received. As free
IgE concentrations above the ULOQ could not be determined by the
free IgE assay, total IgE at baseline (day 1) was used for calculating
the change in free IgE from baseline. Total IgE levels at baseline
reflect free IgE levels, since omalizumab—IgE complexes would not
have formed prior to administration of omalizumab.

Heatmap analyses
Descriptive visual heatmaps of color-coded individual UAS7

values showing patient response to treatment over time (0—24
weeks) were generated using the lattice package for R. Disease

activity levels by UAS7 scores were categorized as follows; high
disease activity (UAS7 >28), moderate disease activity (UAS7
16—27), mild disease (UAS7 7—15), well controlled (UAS7 1—6) and
urticaria free (UAS7 = 0).°°

Statistical analyses

Analyses of efficacy variables were performed on Japanese patients in the full analysis set (FAS), which comprised randomized
patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had no
protocol deviations resulting in exclusion from FAS, with patients
analyzed according to the treatment they were assigned to at
randomization. Safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic
analyses were performed on Japanese patients in the safety set
(SAF) that included patients who took at least one dose of the study
medication, with patients analyzed according to the actual treatment received during the study. Treatment differences for the
primary variable (i.e., change from baseline in on-treatment ISS7 at
Week 12) were assessed using a linear mixed model with repeated
measures (MMRM), which included treatment group, week, and
treatment-by-week interaction as fixed effects, patient as a random
effect, and baseline score as a covariate. The same model was used
to analyze secondary variables, such as change from baseline at
Week 12 in UAS7, the weekly number of hives score, and the weekly
largest hives score. A logistic regression model, with treatment
group as a factor and baseline value as a covariate, was used to
compare the proportion of patients with UAS7 <6, ISS7 MID
response, and UAS7 = 0 at Week 12 across treatment groups. These
model-based country subgroup analyses were not powered to test
the statistical difference between placebo and each omalizumab
group. Missing patient data for heatmap analyses were imputed
using the last observation carried forward (LOCF).

 

Results
Patient disposition

In total, 105 Japanese patients were randomized to treatment
(omalizumab 300 mg, n = 35; omalizumab 150 mg, n = 34; placebo,
n = 36) (Supplementary Fig. 1). The randomized-treatment period
was completed by 100.0%, 97.1%, and 91.7% of patients in the
omalizumab 300 mg, 150 mg, and placebo groups, respectively.
Reasons for discontinuation included AE (n = 1) in the omalizumab
150 mg group, and physician decision (n = 1) and subject/guardian
decision (n = 2) in the placebo group. Post-treatment follow-up
was completed by 88.6%, 97.1% and 94.4% of patients in the omalizumab 300 mg, omalizumab 150 mg, and placebo groups,
respectively. Reasons for stopping participation were lack of efficacy (n = 1), physician decision (n = 1), and subject/guardian decision (n = 1) in the omalizumab 300 mg group, lack of efficacy
(n= 1) in the omalizumab 150 mg group, and new therapy (n = 1)
in the placebo group.

Demographics and baseline characteristics

Baseline characteristics of the randomized patients were
generally well balanced across the treatment groups, although the
duration of CSU was lower in the omalizumab 300 mg group (3.3
years), compared with the omalizumab 150 mg group (5.9 years)
and placebo group (5.1 years; Table 1). Mean baseline body weight
was 62.3 kg (range: 60.0—65.1 kg across treatment groups). The
incidence of angioedema was low across treatment groups (8.6%,
8.8% and 5.6% in the omalizumab 300 mg, omalizumab 150 mg, and
placebo groups, respectively). Mean baseline ISS7, UAS7 and inclinic UAS were comparable among the treatment groups.

Efficacy

Japanese patients in both of the omalizumab groups demonstrated a greater mean decrease in ISS7 at all time points during the
randomized treatment period compared with patients in the placebo group (Fig. 1). This decrease from baseline suggested a dosedependent response, with a greater change from baseline in ISS7
observed in patients treated with omalizumab 300 mg compared
with omalizumab 150 mg for all time points during the treatment
period (Fig. 1). During the post-treatment follow-up, changes from
baseline in ISS7 were greater with both omalizumab doses
compared with placebo up to Week 19. Mean ISS7 values increased
during the follow-up period in the omalizumab groups, with values
comparable with those in the placebo group beyond Week 20 in
both omalizumab treatment groups. Across all treatment groups,
ISS7 values in the post-treatment follow-up were sustained below
baseline through Week 24 (Fig. 1). At Week 12, changes from
baseline in ISS7 (primary outcome) were higher in both omalizumab treatment groups versus placebo, with least squares mean
(LSM) changes (standard error [SE]) of —9.54 (0.85), —7.29 (0.87)
and —5.17 (0.86) in the omalizumab 300 mg, omalizumab 150 mg,
and placebo groups, respectively, for the Japanese study population
(Table 3).

Overall, the findings for key efficacy outcomes were comparable
between the Japanese subgroup and total POLARIS population
(Table 3). At Week 12, greater improvements in all secondary
endpoints were observed in the omalizumab 300 mg and 150 mg
groups compared with the placebo group; these included greater
reductions from baseline to Week 12 for UAS7, the weekly number
of hives score, the weekly largest hive score and the overall DLQI
score. Similarly, a higher proportion of patients achieved UAS7 <6,

omalizumab 150 mg groups compared with placebo; the effect
increased with increasing omalizumab dose, as evidenced by a
higher proportion of patients in the omalizumab 300 mg group
achieving UAS7 <6 and UAS7 = 0 than in the omalizumab 150 mg
group across all three time points. The proportion of patients
achieving UAS7 <6 and UAS7 = 0 also exhibited a time-dependent
response in all treatment groups, with the proportions of responders increasing with time; the proportion of patients
achieving UAS7 <6 in the omalizumab 300 mg group was an
exception to this, as the proportion of responders was found to
plateau between Weeks 8 and 12 (54.3% at Weeks 8 and 12)
(Fig. 2a,b). Descriptive visual heatmaps of color-coded individual
UAS7 values allowed patient-level analysis of time to response in
each treatment group (Fig. 2c). Among omalizumab 300 mg—treated patients who responded, most displayed improvement in disease activity within 2—4 weeks after one dose of omalizumab and
subsequently had well-controlled symptoms (UAS7 <6) without
evidence of relapse during the treatment period. The heatmaps also
showed that the proportion of patients who were treated with
omalizumab 300 mg and 150 mg and who had a sustained UAS7 <6
response gradually decreased during the follow-up period to Week
24. Among placebo-treated patients who achieved UAS7 <6 to
Week 12, most showed a sustained UAS7 <6 response up to Week
24. A relationship between early UAS7 <6 response and a more
sustained response after completion of omalizumab treatment was
not apparent in the heatmaps.

 

Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

Serum omalizumab concentrations increased in a dosedependent manner at Weeks 4 and 12, and then decreased in the
treatment-free follow-up period. At the end of the follow-up phase
(Week 24), the mean omalizumab concentration was 10%—11% of
the mean concentration at the end of the treatment phase (Week
12) (Table 4a). The serum total IgE levels increased by about 200%—
300% from baseline to Weeks 4 and 12 in both omalizumab treatment groups, but did not change in the placebo group. The total IgE
levels were comparable between Week 4 and Week 12 in the
omalizumab treatment groups. Total IgE levels decreased in the
follow-up phase, but were still about 80%—100% higher at the end
of this phase (Week 24) than at baseline, in both of the omalizumab
treatment groups (Table 4b). In the omalizumab 300 mg and
150 mg groups, the median free IgE levels were 24 ng/mL and
30 ng/mL at Week 4, and 19 ng/mL and 21 ng/mL at Week 12,
respectively. Compared to IgE baseline levels, the free IgE levels at
Weeks 4 and 12 decreased by 95% in the omalizumab 300 mg group
and by 90%—93% in the omalizumab 150 mg group (Table 4b). Free
IgE levels increased in the follow-up phase; at Week 24, more than
one-third of the patients in both dose groups had free IgE concentrations above the ULOQ (150 ng/mL). Serum free IgE concentrations were also above the ULOQ in more than one-third of the

patients at baseline and at all time points in the placebo group. As
this factor has an impact on the summary statistics (values above
the ULOQ are not considered), Table 4b provides summary statistics
of free IgE only for the active dose groups at Weeks 4 and 12. The
free IgE assay did not allow expansion of the measurement range
beyond 150 ng/mL. Since total IgE levels at baseline reflect free IgE
levels, baseline values of total IgE were used for calculating the
change from baseline in free IgE.

Overall, serum concentration—time profiles of omalizumab and
total and free IgE were comparable between the Japanese subgroup
and the total POLARIS population across all the treatment groups
(Table 4a,b).

Safety

The proportions of Japanese patients who reported at least one
AE were 54.3%, 67.6%, and 58.3% in the omalizumab 300 mg,
omalizumab 150 mg, and placebo groups, respectively (Table 5). No
severe or serious AEs were reported in any treatment groups. Only
one patient, who was treated with omalizumab 150 mg, discontinued the trial due to an AE; the event (pharyngeal edema) was
reported on Day 1 and had resolved by Day 4 without drug therapy.
This AE was deemed non-anaphylaxis by the independent adjudication review committee because it did not meet the Sampson
criteria (i.e., only one organ system was involved). The incidence of
AEs possibly related to study treatment was comparable across
treatment groups (14.3%, 11.8%, and 13.9% for omalizumab 300 mg,
omalizumab 150 mg, and placebo, respectively). All treatmentemergent AEs were isolated events reported in one patient. Nasopharyngitis was the most commonly experienced AE in all treatment groups, with slightly higher rates reported for placebo
compared with both omalizumab groups (17.1%, 17.6% and 19.4% for
omalizumab 300 mg, omalizumab 150 mg, and placebo groups,
respectively). The incidences of eczema, miliaria, somnolence, acne,
and bronchitis were higher in the omalizumab 300 mg than in the
omalizumab 150 mg and placebo groups. No events of anaphylaxis
were reported; AEs potentially indicative of anaphylaxis were also
reviewed, and none was adjudicated as anaphylaxis. No antiomalizumab antibodies were detected during this study.

Discussion

Analysis of data from the phase 3 POLARIS study demonstrates
that treatment with omalizumab resulted in an improvement in
symptoms in Japanese patients with H;AH-refractory CSU. Patients
in both the omalizumab 300 mg and 150 mg groups had improved
outcomes compared with patients in the placebo group, as evidenced by greater reductions from baseline to Week 12 in ISS7,
UAS7, the weekly number of hives score, the weekly largest hive
score, and the overall DLQI score, as well as a greater proportion of
omalizumab-treated patients achieving responses of UAS7 <6,
UAS7 = 0 and ISS7 MID, compared with those in the placebo group.
The results are consistent with the overall findings of the POLARIS,
which also included Korean patients,”° and with previous global
studies that have predominately included Caucasian
populations.'*'°

As with previously published global studies, the current study
population had relatively severe CSU*! (mean baseline
UAS7 = 29.6), which was comparable to that observed in previously
reported global studies that investigated the efficacy and safety of
omalizumab for the treatment of CSU (range: 29.5—31.7).\4 © In
the current analysis, the mean number of CSU medications used
prior to screening ranged from 6.4 to 8.6, which is higher than that
reported in global omalizumab trials (range: 4.1—6.4).'*!° Of note,
herbal preparations were among the medications used prior to

was topical preparations, of which steroid-based creams were the
most common (data not shown), suggesting that many Japanese
patients with CSU require medications in addition to antihistamines. However, both the current urticaria treatment guidelines
published by the JDA as well as those by the European Academy of
Allergy and Clinical Immunology, the Global Allergy and Asthma
European Network, the European Dermatology Forum, and the
World Allergy Organization (EAACI/GA?LEN/EDF/WAO) indicate
that topical steroids are not helpful in the treatment of urticaria.7°”

The population in the current analysis had a lower incidence of
angioedema (range: 5.6—8.8%) than the total population in the
POLARIS study (16.4—20.3%)°° and in the previous pivotal studies
(40.7—53.1%).'° Low angioedema rates have been previously reported in a Japanese population with urticaria®; however, the
reasons for the low rates among this population are not currently
understood. The results of this subgroup analysis are consistent
with those of the primary POLARIS manuscript”? and confirm that
omalizumab is effective for the treatment of CSU regardless of the
complication of angioedema. The patient-level heatmap analysis
revealed that onset of response following treatment is variable
among patients. While response onset (UAS7 1—6 or UAS7 = 0) in
some Japanese patients was observed as early as Week 2 and
sustained to Week 24, other patients responded more slowly or
did not achieve the UAS7 threshold cut-off for response. Consistent with the results shown in Figure 2a,b, the heatmaps show
that the responder rate is similar across Weeks 8 and 12. It is
noteworthy that the majority of patients who achieved UAS7 <6
by Week 12 had shown improved disease activity by Week 4. This
finding also aligns with analyses of patient responses to omalizumab 300 mg in the ASTERIA I, ASTERIA II and GLACIAL studies,'*-'° and supports there being a subset of patients (i
responders”) that achieved UAS7 <6 as early as Week 4.!
research in a larger study size is essential to characterize
responders.

Analysis of IgE levels in POLARIS demonstrated elevated IgE
levels at baseline, with median values between 300 and 400 ng/mL
(Table 4b), compared with a geometric mean of 105 ng/mL reported
for healthy adults.** An increase in total IgE levels was observed at
Weeks 4 and 12 relative to baseline in patients treated with omalizumab 300 mg and 150 mg; this accumulation of total IgE reflects
the binding of omalizumab to IgE and the formation o

omalizumab-IgE complexes that have a lower clearance and a
longer half-life than free IgE.’”*? The increase of total IgE seems to
have reached a plateau after the first dose, as there is no further
increase between Weeks 4 and 12; this is consistent with previous
findings in patients with allergic asthma who showed a plateau of
total IgE just 2 weeks after starting omalizumab treatment.**

The reduction of free IgE following treatment with omalizumab
at Weeks 4 and/or 12 is consistent with the efficacy results,
including improvements in ISS7 and UAS7. The % change in free IgE
from baseline to Week 4 and Week 12 was —95% and —95% with the
300 mg dose, compared with —90% and —93% with the 150 mg dose,
respectively. The efficacy results observed in omalizumab-treated
patients can be attributed to a number of events, including the
downregulation of IgE receptors on basophils, mast cells, Langerhans cells and dendritic cells as a result of depletion of free IgE by
omalizumab.*°° Treatment with omalizumab is reported to result
in suppression of the inflammatory response via a reduction of proinflammatory cytokines, dendritic cells, lymphocytes, and eosinophils,*” as well as via a decrease in IgE production.*®

Pharmacokinetic modeling using data from the global pivotal
omalizumab studies has suggested that the reduction of free IgE in
serum correlates with an improvement in CSU symptoms.** The
findings of this current analysis of efficacy and free IgE levels in the
serum of patients from the POLARIS study population are consistent with that hypothesis. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic profiles were consistent between the Japanese population and the total
POLARIS population in any treatment group. The pattern of AEs was
also generally consistent with that of the overall POLARIS
population.”°

This pre-specified subgroup analysis of the POLARIS study
demonstrates that omalizumab is a well-tolerated, beneficial option for the treatment of CSU in Japanese patients who remained
symptomatic despite treatment with an HAH. These findings are
consistent with previous clinical studies of omalizumab for the
treatment of CSU,'* '” and suggest that ethnic differences (e.g.,
incidence of angioedema) do not affect treatment outcomes with
omalizumab.
