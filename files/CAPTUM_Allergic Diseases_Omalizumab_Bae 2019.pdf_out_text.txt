Serum transglutaminase 2 activity as a potential biomarker of disease
severity and response to omalizumab in chronic spontaneous urticaria

Dear Editor,

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is characterized by recurrent hives with or without angioedema lasting for more than 6
weeks; it affects 0.5—1% of the population worldwide. Although
CSU is not a life-threatening condition, it has a large impact on
quality of life.!7

The basic treatment for CSU is second-generation H; antihistamines (HiAH). However, approximately 50% of CSU are not
controlled with H;AH, even with increasing doses.’ Cyclosporine
and omalizumab - humanized monoclonal anti-IgE antibodies
have been suggested as second or third-line therapies for CSU unresponsive to H;AH.'* However, there remain a substantial proportion of CSU patients that are not completely responsive to these
drugs.!?

We previously reported that transglutaminase 2 (TG2), an
enzyme involved in the posttranslational modification of proteins
by deamination and amine incorporation, plays an important role
in CSU pathogenesis, showing high expression and release in human mast cells.‘ In this study, we investigated the clinical implications of serum TG2 activity as a potential biomarker of disease
severity and response to omalizumab treatment.

Subjects were recruited between 2015 and 2017 at the allergy
and dermatology outpatient clinic in Hallym University Dongtan
Sacred Heart Hospital, and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (HDT2014-06-135-003). We enrolled 111 CSU
patients, 31 patients with acute urticaria (AU, male: 48.4%, age:
39.97 + 14.12), and 45 nonallergic normal controls (NC, male:
28.9%, age: 40.07 + 17.45). Inducible urticaria was excluded. AU patients were recruited from the emergency room when they had an
acute occurrence of urticaria with or without angioedema that was
cured within 1 week without recurrence.

CSU patients were divided into four subgroups by disease
severity which was decided by treatment levels from the guidelines
for the treatment of chronic urticaria with modification': ‘Mild’ —
well controlled with second-generation HjAH; ‘Moderate’ —
controlled with multiple combinations of second-generation
HAH; ‘Severe’ — controlled with addition of leukotriene receptor
antagonist and/or H2-antagonist; ‘Very severe’ — patients whose
urticaria was controlled or not adequately controlled with the addition of cyclosporine or omalizumab. CSU was regarded as
‘controlled’ when UAS7 (urticaria activity score over 7 days) was
6 or less.”

Serum obtained after stopping all medications for at least 3 days
was used for ASST and measurement of TG2. Blood in AU was
drawn before pharmacological treatment at the ER. Serial blood
sampling from the 9 patients who were completely or partially
responsive to omalizumab treatment (symptom improvement
and UAS7 < 15) was conducted before each omalizumab injection.
Serum TG2 activity was measured using a TG2-Covtest kit (Covalab,
Villeurbanne, France).

Statistical analyses were conducted by one-way ANOVA test,
Student's t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and ROC analysis using
R (version 3.3.1, The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria). Data were presented as mean + standard deviation (SD). A
P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Patients’ characteristics are shown in Supplementary Table 1.
TG2 activity was significantly higher in the sera of CSU
(132.8 + 81.6 mU/mL) than in AU (86.4 + 57.8 mU/mL) and NC
(70.0 + 42.4 mU/mL) (P < 0.01, Fig. 1A), while no difference was
observed between AU and NC. Serum TG2 activity was not significantly different according to sex, ASST, atopy, and angioedema,
and it did not correlate with age, blood eosinophil count, or serum
total IgE. ROC analysis showed that the differential cutoff value of
serum TG2 activity between CSU and AU was 121.1 mU/mL, with
sensitivity of 54.1% and specificity of 77.4% (AUC 0.661, 95% CI
[0.560—0.762], P = 0.006, Supplementary Fig. 1). Serum TG2 activity was significantly increased in correlation to disease severity
(Mild: 87.1 + 66.3, Moderate: 136.1 + 64.0, Severe: 159.7 + 59.0,
Very severe: 222.1 + 68.1 mU/mL, P < 0.0001, Fig. 1B). In contrast,
there was no significant correlation between urticaria severity
and blood eosinophil count or total IgE levels. In the
omalizumab-responsive group (n = 9), serum TG2 activity was
significantly decreased upon omalizumab treatment at two time
points (weeks 2—6 and weeks 16—24, P < 0.01, Fig. 2).

Blood biomarkers of CSU for measuring disease activity, monitoring treatment response, or predicting prognosis are yet to be
identified. Although the questionnaires, such as urticaria activity
score (UAS), urticaria control test, etc. are validated and useful for
the purpose, they are subjective and retrospective.'” There have
been many attempts to establish useful blood biomarkers in CSU,
where several biomarkers have been replicated in different studies.
The potential biomarkers for disease activity include D-dimer, Creactive protein, matrix metalloproteinase-9, mean platelet volume, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, and interleukin-G.° Activation
of coagulation/fibrinolysis participates in the pathogenesis of the
CSU is still unclear, nevertheless, D-dimer has been reported to
be a biomarker for treatment response to omalizumab and cyclosporine.”’ Two studies showed D-dimer level appeared to follow

the positive or negative clinical response to the treatment via long
term follow up period (up to 12 months). Furthermore, total IgE
levels have been recently reported to predict the response to omalizumab.® A major issue is that these biomarkers, whose levels can
be increased due to comorbid conditions, such as chronic infections
and autoimmune diseases, are not specific to CSU pathogenesis.

TG2 has been reported to be involved in inflammation of allergic
asthma by Th2 differentiation via TG2-mediated IL-33 expression.°
Hong et al.'° found that TG2 expressed during mast cell activation enhances IgE production in B cells by up-regulating CD40L expression.
We also found that TG2 expression was increased in mast cells in
the lesional skin of CSU patients, and that cultured human mast cells
derived from peripheral blood or cord blood released TG2 during activation, suggesting that TG2 is involved in the pathogenesis of CSU.4

Here, we found that serum TG2 activity was increased with disease severity and decreased after omalizumab treatment. Moreover, serum TG2 activity of CSU was higher than that of AU,
showing 121 mU/mL as a differential cutoff value between AU
and CSU. Considering the association between TG2 and CSU pathogenesis, serum TG2 activity can be a more specific marker of disease
severity and monitoring response to omalizumab treatment in CSU,
compared with previously reported biomarkers.

Our study has one limitation that we did not assess the relationship between serum TG2 activity and disease activity, such
as UAS. Instead, we assessed ‘disease severity’ which is defined
by medication requirement. ‘Disease severity’ in the current study
might not reflect the severity of symptoms associated with
urticaria.

In conclusion, serum TG2 activity could be a useful biomarker in
predicting the medication requirement for disease control. Further
study will be needed to confirm this.
