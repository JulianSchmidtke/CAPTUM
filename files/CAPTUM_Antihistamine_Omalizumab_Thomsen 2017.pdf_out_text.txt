Abstract

Background: Chronic urticaria (CU) is characterised by the recurrence of itchy hives and/or
angioedema for more than six weeks. AWARE (A World-wide Antihistamine-Refractory
Chronic Urticaria Patient Evaluation) is a multinational study designed to document the reallife treatment situation, burden of disease, and clinical resource usage of H1-antihistamine

refractory CU patients.

Objective: To examine baseline data from Scandinavian AWARE patients.

Methods: AWARE is a prospective, non-interventional, multinational, umbrella design study,
which includes adults (218 years) with a confirmed CU diagnosis (>2 months) that is
refractory to H1-antihistamines. Baseline patient characteristics, disease activity (urticaria
control test [UCT]), pharmacological treatment, comorbidities, and healthcare usage were
documented by the treating physician. Quality of life (QoL; dermatology life quality index
[DLQI]; chronic urticaria quality of life questionnaire [CU-Q.0L; Danish patients only]) and

work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI) scores were also assessed.

Results: Overall, 158 CU patients from seven centres in Denmark (n=80), Norway (n=50),

and Sweden (n=28) were included in this baseline analysis. Mean age and BMI were 40.3

years and 26.5 kg/m’, respectively. The majority of patients were female (69.6%), had
uncontrolled CU (75.6%; UCT score <12), and had a “spontaneous” component to their CU
(61.4% CSU; 20.3% both CSU and chronic inducible urticaria). Common comorbidities
included asthma (19.6%), allergic rhinitis (16.5%), and food allergies (8.2%). Overall, 60.1%
of patients reported using treatments for CU including non-sedative H1-antihistamines
(40.5%), corticosteroids (19%), montelukast (14.6%) and omalizumab (8.2%).
Pharmacological treatment rates increased to 96.2% during the baseline visit. On average,
patient QoL was moderately affected (mean DLQI score 7.7) and healthcare resource usage

was high.

Conclusion: Adult Scandinavian H1-antihistamine refractory CU patients reported high rates
of healthcare usage and QoL impairment. Rates of pharmacological treatment use were low

before study enrolment but increased to almost 100% during the baseline visit.

Introduction

Chronic urticaria (CU), which includes chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and chronic
inducible urticaria (ClIndU), is characterised by the recurrence of itchy hives and/or
angioedema for more than six weeks.(1) CSU can be further divided into CSU due to
unknown causes and CSU due to a known cause, e.g. proven autoimmune mediated CSU.(24) The symptoms of CSU develop without any specific physical or external triggers, whereas
the symptoms of ClndU develop in response to specific triggers (e.g. heat urticaria, cold
urticaria, delayed pressure urticaria, solar urticaria, symptomatic dermographism,
cholinergic urticaria, vibratory urticaria, and aquagenic urticaria).(5) The estimated

(4, 6-8)

prevalence of CU is up to 1% in the general population, with females reported to be

affected approximately twice as often as males and the highest incidence between the ages

of 20 and 40 years.(6, 9)

International guidelines recommend a stepwise treatment approach to achieve symptom
control in CU.(1, 10) These guidelines recommend initial treatment with labelled doses of
second generation non-sedating H1-antihistamines (H1-AH). For patients with an
inadequate treatment response within two weeks, up-titration of the H1-AH dose up to four
times the labelled dose is recommended (high dose). If high dose continues to offer
inadequate symptom relief after four weeks, guidelines recommend three add-on treatment
options: montelukast, omalizumab, or cyclosporine.(1) However, the extent to which these

guidelines are adhered to in patients from Scandinavian countries remains unclear.

Patients with CU are reported to experience considerable disease burden and quality of life
(QoL) impairment, which can include anxiety, economic burden, and increased healthcare
use.(6-8, 11-14) The burden of disease in Scandinavian patients with H1-AH refractory CU
remains unknown. Furthermore, there is no comprehensive Scandinavian CU patient
database reviewing H1-AH refractory CU patients. As a result, very little is known regarding
the demographics, disease characteristics and prevalence of comorbidities in Scandinavian

patients.

The AWARE (A World-wide Antihistamine-Refractory Chronic Urticaria Patient Evaluation)
study is a multinational non-interventional study, which has been designed to document the
real-life treatment situation, burden of disease, and use of clinical resources of patients with
H1-AH refractory CU. This interim analysis examines the baseline demographics, disease
characteristics, pharmacological treatment, and the extent of disease burden in

Scandinavian CU patients who are refractory to H1-AHs.

Materials and methods

These baseline data from Denmark, Sweden, and Norway were collected as part of the
ongoing non-interventional, multinational, umbrella design AWARE study. This study is
being conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki, the principles of Good
Clinical Practice, and national laws and regulations regarding clinical studies. Approval from
the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee/Research Ethics Board was
obtained for each centre and all participating patients gave written informed consent before

any data was recorded.

Study patients

Inclusion criteria were age 218 years, ability to provide informed consent, and a medically
confirmed diagnosis of CU for more than 2 months, which is refractory to treatment with
H1-AH (refractory disease was defined as evidence of failed labelled dose or up to 4-fold
labelled dose of H1-AHs). Patients were excluded from the study if they were participating
in any other clinical urticaria study or if it was unlikely they would be available for the full
duration of the follow-up period of 24 months. A patient evaluation was performed at
baseline (visit 1), which included demographic data collection, CU-related medical history
(treatment, course of disease, diagnosis, and presence of angioedema), details of
pharmacological treatment for CU, and existing comorbidities. Patients were also asked to
indicate whether they had used any additional healthcare resources since their CU
symptoms began and, if so, how frequently they had used each resource. During the
baseline visit, patients’ pharmacological treatment was changed if deemed necessary by the

treating physician.

Study objectives

The overall primary objective of the worldwide AWARE study is correlation of patientreported outcomes (PROs: Dermatology Life Quality Index, DLQI; Chronic Urticaria Quality of
Life questionnaire, CU-Q:,0L; CU specific Work Productivity and Activity Impairment, WPAICU; Urticaria Control Test, UCT and optional Urticaria Activity Score over 7 days, UAS7) with
the treatment options used in patients with H1-AH refractory CU. The aim of this baseline
evaluation is to document the disease characteristics, the pharmacological treatments used,
and the burden of CU in patients treated in urticaria centres in the Scandinavian arm of the
AWARE study. Furthermore, the influence of disease and patient characteristics on QoL was

investigated.

Patient reported outcomes

Physicians had the option to assess patients using validated disease activity (UCT; UAS7),
QoL (CU-Q,0L; DLQI) and work productivity (WPAI-CU) questionnaires. The UCT is a 4-item
questionnaire for assessing CU disease activity retrospectively over the previous 4
weeks.(15) Each item is rated on a Likert-type scale (0 = very often and 4 = not at all) and a
total score is calculated (range, 0 to 16; higher scores indicate better disease control; scores
212 are consistent with well-controlled disease). The UAS instrument includes two items:
itch intensity (0 = no itch and 3 = severe itch) and number of hives (0 = none and 3 >50).(1)
The sum of both items is calculated daily (UAS; range, 0-6) and the weekly score (UAS7;
range, 0-42) is calculated based on seven consecutive days. The CU-Q20L questionnaire,
which was only recorded in Danish patients, includes 23 questions relating to overall

functioning (including work, physical, leisure and social activities), sleep,

itching/embarrassment, mental status, swelling/eating, and limits looks (limitations in
choice of clothing or cosmetics used due to urticaria symptoms). Total scores range from 0
to 100, with higher scores indicating worse QoL.(16) The DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire
relating to patients’ symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school,
personal relationships and treatment. Total DLQI scores range from 0-30, with higher scores
indicating worse QoL.(17) The WPAI-CU evaluates work productivity and activity impairment
due to chronic urticaria with the aid of six short questions relating to absenteeism (the
percentage of work time missed due to urticaria), presenteeism (the percentage of
impairment experienced while at work), overall work productivity (an overall work
impairment estimate based on absenteeism and presenteeism) and overall activity
impairment (the percentage of impairment in daily activities) over the previous 7 days.(18)
Only employed patients respond to the work-related questions, whereas all patients

respond to the activity-related questions.

Data management and statistical analysis

Documentation was performed by the treating physician exclusively online in the electronic
case report form, with the exception of the patient questionnaires that were available as
hardcopy forms. Data were analyzed primarily with descriptive methods using SAS® V 9.2
(SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, North Carolina, US). Means and standard deviations (SD) were
calculated for continuous variables and percentages and frequencies were calculated for

categorial variables.

Linear regression analysis, with stepwise backward elimination, was used to select patient

characteristics that influence DLQI scores. Potential influencing factors examined were: age,

gender (male versus female), time since diagnosis, comorbidities (four variables: metabolic,
atopic, autoimmune, and psychiatric disease), body mass index (BMI), current hives (yes or
no), angioedema (yes or no), UCT score, sick leave (yes or no), and diagnostic group (CSU,
CSU and ClndU, or ClndU). Bivariate analysis was used to illustrate and further evaluate the
influence of each selected variable; p-values of respective statistical tests (ANOVA models
and t-tests) are provided and values below 0.05 considered as statistically significant.
However, these tests only have exploratory character and therefore no adjustment for

multiple testing has been performed.

Results

Baseline demographics and disease characteristics

Of 161 patients registered from 7 specialised urticaria centres across Norway (n = 50),
Sweden (n = 28) and Denmark (n = 83), 158 CU patients met all the study criteria and were
included in the final analysis population (two patients were excluded as they were
registered after the cut-off date and one patient did not meet all the inclusion criteria). The
mean patient age was 40.3 years, with the highest fraction (26.6%) of patients aged 35 to
<45. The majority of patients were female and over 50% of patients were overweight (BMI

>25; Table 1).

Over 80% of patients with H1-AH refractory CU had a “spontaneous” component to their
disease (61.4% CSU; 20.2% both CSU and ClndU; and 18.4% had ClndU only). The most
common CindU subtypes were cold urticaria (18.4%), symptomatic dermographism (8.9%),

and cholinergic urticaria (7.6%; Table 2). Overall, 85.4% had experienced hives within the

previous 6 months and for the majority of patients hives lasted less than 24 hours (94.8%).
Angioedema had occurred in 32.9% of patients within the previous six months (Table 2);
3.8% rated their angioedema as negligible, 53.8% as mild, 34.6% as moderate, and 7.7% as

severe.

Pharmacological treatment

The most commonly reported treatments at the baseline visit included non-sedative H1-AH
(any dose 40.5%: labelled dose, 12.7%; high dose, 29.1%; unknown dose, 3.2%),
corticosteroids (19%), montelukast (14.6%), and omalizumab (8.2%). Denmark had the
highest proportion of treated patients, followed by Norway and Sweden (Table 3). During
the same visit, if deemed necessary by the physicians, the patient’s treatment was changed
(reported as current treatment), with rates increasing to 96.2% for any treatment. Nonsedative H1-AH continued to be the most common treatment prescribed (any dose 87.3%;
labelled dose, 8.2%; high dose, 76.6%; unknown, 4.4%), followed by omalizumab (42.4%),
montelukast (12.7%) and corticosteroids (12.7%; Table 3). Overall, 100% of Norwegian
patients were prescribed non-sedative H1-AHs (80%, Danish; 85.7%, Swedish). However,
Danish patients were more commonly treated with omalizumab, montelukast, and

cyclosporine compared with patients in Norway and Sweden (Table 3).

Comorbidities

The most commonly reported comorbidities were asthma (19.6%), allergic rhinitis (16.5%),
food allergies (8.2%), and other eczema (7.6%; Table 4). Other common comorbidities (>5%)
included atopic dermatitis, nut allergies, thyroid diseases including Hashimoto’s thyroiditis,
obesity and hypertension. The proportion of patients with a diagnosis of anxiety (3.2%) or

depression (4.4%) was low.

Burden of disease: disease activity, quality of life and work productivity

The mean UCT score (+ SD) was 8.3 (4.8), indicating that on average patients’ urticaria was
not sufficiently controlled; only 44/155 patients (24.4%) presented with well-controlled
urticaria (UCT score 212). Norwegian patients had the lowest mean UCT scores at baseline
and were therefore most affected by CU (Table 5). Patients rated their satisfaction with

their treatment as 6.1 (mean) ona visual analogue scale (VAS).

Overall, CU had a moderate effect on QoL, with a mean DLQI score of 7.7. Mean DLQI scores
were higher in Norway (10.9) than Denmark (6.3) and Sweden (6.0), which indicates worse
QoL. In addition to the DLQI score, the CU-Q,oL score was assessed in 77 Danish patients.
The most severely affected subdomains of the CU-Q,oL were sleep (mean, 41.2),
itching/embarrassment (mean, 35.7), and mental status (mean, 30.9). The least affected

subdomain of the CU-Q20L was swelling/eating (mean, 14.7; Table 5).

A total of 155 patients completed the WPAI questionnaire. Employed patients (n = 111)
reported missing work during the past 7 days due to their CU, accounting for 3.7% (mean) of
their work time (absenteeism). Overall, 20.6% of their work productivity time was lost due
to CU (presenteeism) and total work productivity impairment accounted for 23.2% of their
time. Outside the workplace, patients (n=155) reported activity impairment due to CU,
accounting for 29.5% of their time (Table 6). Furthermore, 25.9% of patients reported sick

leave, since urticaria symptoms began, due to urticaria (Table 6).

Healthcare resource utilisation

Rates of healthcare utilisation were high amongst these Scandinavian AWARE patients:
72.5% had visited a general practitioner (GP), 68.6% had visited another dermatologist or

allergist, 42.5% had visited specialised urticaria centres and 27.5% had visited an emergency

physician or the emergency room due to urticaria since their urticaria symptoms started.
The frequency of visits to healthcare resources ranged from a mean number of visits of 1.0
(pharmacy) to 10.5 (alternative practitioner). Other healthcare resource utilisation reported

included, dentists, ear-nose-throat specialists, and hospitalisation (Table 7).

Factors affecting DLQI scores

Disease severity (UCT scores) was the most significant influencer of DLQI scores, whereby
patients with better disease control (UCT scores 212) had lower mean DLQI scores than
patients with UCT scores <12 (n=44; 2.52 versus 9.80, respectively; p <0.0001). Patients with
sick leave had higher mean DLQI scores (10.11 [n=38]) than patients without sick leave (6.97
[n=117]; p = 0.0088). Patients with ClndU had the highest mean DLQI scores and patients
with CSU only had the lowest scores (ClndU, 11.38 [n=29]; ClndU and CSU, 7.65 [n=31]; CSU,
6.65 [n=95]; p = 0.0022). No statistically significant association between DLQI outcomes and
age, gender, BMI, time since diagnosis, comorbidities, current hives, and presence of

angioedema was seen (data not shown).

Discussion

Here we present baseline disease characteristics and demographics from a study of 158 H1AH refractory CU patients who have been referred to specialised urticaria centres in
Denmark, Sweden and Norway. The baseline characteristics of this Scandinavian patient
cohort are generally consistent with previous publications.(6-9, 19) The majority of patients
experienced hives that lasted for less than 24 hours and almost one third of patients

reported experiencing angioedema, which is within the previously published range.(9, 19)

The mean patient age was 40.3, over two-thirds of patients were female, and over half of all
patients in this cohort were overweight (BMI >25). An association between obesity and risk
of urticaria has recently been suggested by Lapi and colleagues.[3] Similarly, CU patients
from the EU (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK) had a significantly higher average

BMI than the control population.[8]

The most common diagnosis was CSU. However, these Scandinavian AWARE results provide
new insight into the rates of co-occurrence of CSU and ClIndU (20.3%) in CU patients.
Symptomatic dermographism has previously been reported to be the most common of the
physical urticarias; however, in this patient cohort, rates were lower than previously
reported.(20, 21) This may be due to selection bias, as patients with symptomatic
dermographism may be referred to specialised clinics less frequently. The data also indicate
that in this Scandinavian AWARE patient cohort, cold urticaria is the most commonly
diagnosed ClndU subtype (18.4%). It has previously been suggested that cold urticaria is
more common in colder climates,?” 72) but studies involving structured provocation have
not been performed. It is also possible that due to the colder climate in Norway, Sweden
and Denmark, patients with cold urticaria have more severe or more persistent symptoms
than patients in warmer climates, and they are more likely to be referred to specialised
centres for treatment. Future results from other countries involved in the AWARE study will
provide further insight into any geographical or climate differences associated with the rates

of specific CIndU subtypes.

Despite pharmacological therapies being recommended as the first line treatment for CU, in
this study, only 60.1% of patients reported baseline treatment. These data suggest that a
large proportion of patients are not receiving adequate pharmacological treatment.
Moreover, only 40.5% of patients reported non-sedative H1-AH use at baseline. As patients
did not specify why they were not receiving H1-AH treatment, we can only speculate that
this may be due to two major factors: firstly, the referring medical practitioner may not have
been up to date with the latest CU treatment guidelines and did not recommend the
appropriate H1-AH treatment regimen after initial lack of response; secondly, patients were
treated per the guidelines and stopped H1-AH treatment before the baseline visit due to

lack of response.

The rates of treatment increased to 96.2% at the first visit; the most commonly prescribed
treatment continued to be non-sedative H1-AHs; however, 42.4% of patients were now
treated with omalizumab. At baseline more Danish patients reported pharmacological
treatment compared to Swedish and Norwegian patients. Furthermore, Danish patients had

the highest rates of third-line treatments at baseline and at the end of the first visit.

The most common comorbidities were atopic diseases: asthma, allergic rhinitis, food
allergies, eczema and atopic dermatitis. The rates of the majority of these comorbidities
were lower than previously reported in German CU patients (allergic rhinitis, 41.9%; atopic
dermatitis, 18.9%; allergic asthma, 17.6%).(24) However, the German study was a crosssectional sample of 13,300 inhabitants of Berlin (n = 4053 respondents; n = 189 with
confirmed current urticaria); therefore, the results are not directly compared to this AWARE
patient cohort being treated at specialised urticaria centres. Similarly, the rates of

psychiatric comorbidities were lower than recent estimates of major depression and general

anxiety disorder in the Swedish general population”>)

and rates of depression were in line
with reported estimates for Nordic countries — between 3.5% and 5% for depression.(26)
These rates are lower than expected, as previous studies have reported higher rates of
psychiatric disorders in CSU patients.(27) Furthermore, two recent studies in the US and EU
have reported increased rates of both anxiety and depression in patients being treated for
CU compared with matched comparisons.(7, 8) Inconsistencies in our data may be due to
differences in the diagnostic criteria used, due to heterogeneous patient populations
examined, or due to selection bias. The lack of matched patient controls makes it difficult to

interpret this depression and anxiety data and further research is required to fully

understand the link between psychological comorbidities and CU.

The burden of CU is considerable; previous publications report that CU is associated with
poor QoL, increased healthcare use, and increased absenteeism, presenteeism, and work
impairment.(7, 8, 28-30) The mean UCT scores were lowest in the Norwegian patient cohort
than in the Danish and Swedish cohorts; in line with this observation, DLQI scores were
higher in the Norwegian patient group than in the other two groups, indicating lower QoL.
However, the low patient numbers preclude drawing any further conclusions regarding why

differences between the three countries might be seen.

In this patient group, average DLQI scores indicate that patients were moderately affected
by their CU and that poor disease control (UCT score <12) was associated with poor QoL,
which is in line with previous CU studies.(16) Comorbidities, current hives, and presence of
angioedema did not influence DLQI in these patients. CU-Q2o0L scores were only available for
the Danish patients in this AWARE study. Our results indicate that sleep,

itching/embarrassment, and mental status were the most severely affected subdomains of

patient QoL. Similarly, Mlynek and colleagues reported that sleep, itching/embarrassment,

and mental status were the most affected subdomains in 157 German CU patients.(16)

Healthcare resource utilisation was common in this patient cohort. Similarly, healthcare use
in the previous 6 months was significantly higher in CU patients versus matched controls.(7,
8) Furthermore, the rates of work absenteeism and presenteeism were high in this AWARE
patient group and patients with sick leave reported significantly worse DLQI scores. Previous
publications also suggest that mean levels of absenteeism, presenteeism, and overall work
impairment is significantly higher in patients currently treated for CU than matched

controls.(7, 8)

This study has a number of strengths. We included patients from three countries with
similar healthcare systems, which should allow for a good cross section of the CU patient
population to have been examined. We also provide new insight into the disease burden
and impact of CU in Scandinavian patients and the variables that influence health-related
QoL. Furthermore, the patients included in this AWARE study were treated in specialised
urticaria centres; this ensures that CU has been correctly diagnosed. Limitations of the study
include the small sample size and potential for selection bias as patients were only recruited
from specialised urticaria centres. Although access to the clinics is not dependent on private
insurance, which should allow for all patients to access the highly specialised clinics, the
recruitment may be biased towards patients with more severe CU. This may have led to
overestimation of the rates of cold urticaria and other ClndUs, corticosteroid treatment,

angioedema, and/or the extent of disease burden.

Conclusions:

This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
These data highlight the unmet treatment needs for adult H1-AH refractory CU patients in
Scandinavia. A large proportion of patients are not treated even with the most basic
pharmacological therapies. Additionally, patients have health-related QoL impairment, high
usage of healthcare resources and impaired work productivity. These burdens are likely to
be associated with an additional economic burden to society. Improved education and
dissemination of knowledge and the guidelines is urgently required to improve patients

care.
