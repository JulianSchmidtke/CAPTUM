Clinical and laboratory parameters in predicting chronic urticaria

duration: a prospective study of 139 patients

Background: Despite the disabling nature of chronic urticaria (CU), little is
known about the disease’s duration or the efficacy of adopting aggressive
therapeutic regimens such as cyclosporine A.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether parameters such as
angioedema, autologous serum test, anti-thyroid antibodies, and total IgE could
predict both CU duration and severity.

Patients and methods: One hundred and thirty-nine patients suffering from CU
were prospectively followed over a 5-year period for disease duration, severity
and the presence of angioedema. Also investigated was the association between
these clinical parameters and the subsequent detection of autologous serum test,
anti-thyroid antibodies, and total IgE.

Results: CU lasted over 1 year in more than 70% of cases and in 14% it still
existed after 5 years. Angioedema co-existed or appeared during the course of
CU in 40% of patients and was associated with disease duration. Autologous
serum test and anti-thyroid antibodies were found positive in 28 and 12% of
patients, respectively, compared to none of normal individuals, P = 0.001. CU
duration was associated with the presence of both autologous serum test and
anti-thyroid antibodies; however, autologous serum test and not anti-thyroid
antibodies was found in association with CU severity.

Conclusion: We demonstrate for the first time that CU duration is associated
with clinical parameters such as severity and angioedema, and with laboratory
parameters such as autologous serum test and anti-thyroid antibodies. The
ability to predict CU duration may facilitate decisions regarding the possible
early initiation of cyclosporine A as a means by which to reduce disease severity
and duration.

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common disabling disorder
occurring in 0.1% of the population, with an average
duration of 3—5 years in adults (1). Physical urticaria and
intolerance to food additives account for 20% and nearly
5% of such patients, respectively, with the remaining
defined as chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU). Nevertheless, in 40% of patients, physical urticaria such as delayed
pressure urticaria and dermographism were shown to
co-exist with CIU (2-4).

In 1986, Grattan et al. (5) reported the presence of a
serum factor that caused whealing upon autologous
intradermal injection (autologous serum test, AST) in
some patients with CIU. However, the autoimmune
dimension of CU became apparent only in 1993 when
Greaves and colleagues (6) identified this factor as an IgG
with specificity for the o-chain of the high-affinity IgE
receptor (FceRIa). The presence of anti-FceRIa, ranging
from 25 to 45% of the total patients with CIU, was
demonstrated by many to be the causative autoantibody
that results in mast cell degranulation (7, 8). The

possibility that CU is at least partially autoimmune is
consistent with previous findings of increased frequency
of anti-thyroid antibodies (ATA) and other autoimmune
markers such as rheumatoid factor (9, 10).

Although most investigators concur that laboratory
tests such as CBC, chemistry panel, complement levels
and skin test are noncontributory, autoimmune markers
such as anti-nuclear (ANA), AST, ATA, and total IgE
are worthy of consideration and were subsequently
obtained routinely by most clinicians for the evaluation
of CU. In practice, most specialists who deal this
disabling disorder are mainly concerned with the management of these patients. H1 anti-histamine treatment is
beneficial for mild—moderate CU patients. However,
when CU is severe and short courses of corticosteroids
are unavoidable, low dose of cyclosporine A (CsA) was
reported by many to be both safe and beneficial (11-13).
The natural history of CIU becomes particularly
important when such forms of treatment are considered,
given that the efficacy of such treatment modalities are

869
Toubi et al.

likely to vary with the disease course. Yet, reports on the
natural history of CU are very limited, and for the most
part fail to cover the possible association between the
clinical course of CU and laboratory analyses (14-17).
Consequently, we still know little about the average
duration of CU and the prevalence of CU lasting longer
than | year. We also know little about the efficacy of CsA
treatment among severe patients symptomatic for longer
than | year, not to mention the efficacy of early initiation
of CsA in particularly severe cases.

The current study was designed to analyze whether
urticaria duration could be predicted by various clinical
and laboratory parameters such as AST, ANA, ATA,
total IgE, and others in a large cohort of patients who
were prospectively followed in our referral outpatient
clinic over a period of 5 years.

Patients and methods

This prospective study included 145 CIU patients (92 females and
53 males, age range 17-66 years, mean 41 years) who were followed by four senior allergists in two large referral outpatient
allergy clinics from 1998 until 2003. The follow-up time ranged
between 3 and 5 years. Exclusion criteria included pure physical
urticaria, infectious diseases, and food or food additive hypersensitivity. Chronic infection was excluded on the basis of a
detailed history, physical examination, and related laboratory
analyses such as stool culture and eosinophils for parasites,
C-reactive protein, and antibodies to Helicobacter pylori when
suspected (18). Food and food additive hypersensitivity were
excluded on the basis of skin prick tests for a wide panel of food
allergens and a trial of mono-allergen elimination diet. When
highly suspected, oral food additive provocation tests were initiated (19, 20).

All patients underwent the following laboratory workup: CBC,
chemistry panel, protein-electrophoresis (PEP) and complement
levels. ANAs were detected by using indirect fluorescent antibody
technique on HEP-2 commercial slides (Zeus Scientific, Inc., New
Jersey, USA), anti-thyroglobulin and thyroid microsomal antibodies were detected by ELISA commercial kits (Orgentec Diagnostika,
GmbH, Mainz, Germany), and total IgE was detected by a Ridascreen, ELISA kit (Darmstadt, Germany). AST was detected upon
entry in only 127 patients. All laboratory tests were compared with
those analyzed in 60 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals
(employees of both medical centers), who served as normal controls.
During follow-up, six patients dropped out, leaving a sample of 139
patients for whom complete information was available.

Informed consent was obtained from each patient and the study
protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration
of Helsinki as reflected in a priori approval by the Bnai Zion
Medical Center Human Research Committee.

Urticaria score

All patients were scored on a four-point scale as detailed previously
by Breneman et al. (21). Briefly, this scale takes into account the
number of lesions, number of separate episodes, average size of
lesions, average duration of lesions and pruritus as follows: 0 = no
symptoms; | = mild urticaria (1-4 points); 2 = moderate urticaria
(5-9 points); 3 = severe urticaria (=10 points).

Autologous serum test

AST was performed in all the individuals studied (in patients after
antihistamine washout) as previously described (22). Briefly, 0.1 mlof
sterile autologous serum was injected intradermaly, and the wheal/
flare size was determined at 30 min and followed for a total of 60 min.
Saline was used as a negative control and histamine (1 mg/ml) served
as a positive control. The wheal/flare diameter was measured and
scored from 0 to +3 as follows: 0 = negative control; + 1 = wheal
1.5mm > negative control, flare = 15 mm; +2 wheal = 3-5 mm,
flare > 15 mm; +3 = wheal = 6-10 mm. A widely used simplification of this test was suggested by the same group, that is, AST is
considered positive when the wheal attained is at least 1.5 mm greater
than the negative control (23).

Statistical analyses

Associations between categorical groups were assessed using the chisquare test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The relation
between urticaria duration and disease severity, angioedema, AST
and ATA was evaluated using the log-rank test. Kaplan—Meier
curves were constructed and displayed for the relation between
urticaria duration and each of the above variables. Two-tailed
P-values of 0.05 or less were considered to be statistically significant.

Results
Patient characteristics

At commencement of the study and during the following
3 months of follow-up, 28/139 (20%) patients were
scored as mild CU, whereas 45/139 (32%) and 66/139
(47%) were scored as suffering from moderate to severe
CU, respectively. Angioedema (at least three episodes of
angioedema during a month) co-existed or appeared
during the course of CU in 56/139 (40%) of patients.
Patients with mild CU were treated periodically with
antihistamines, whereas most patients with moderate to
severe CU were on antihistamines most of the time and
frequently needed short courses of corticosteroids.

Duration of CU

After 6 months of follow-up, 94% of patients were still
found to be CU-positive. At the end of 12 months CU
was still ongoing in 75% of patients, whereas towards the
end of 24 months CU was present in 52% of patients.
After 36 months of follow-up CU was still present in
43% of patients, and by the end of the study (5 years)
14% of patients were still suffering from CU.

Laboratory analyses

All patients presented normal chemistry panel, CBC,
PEP, and complement levels. ANA were found positive in
6/139 (4%) of patients compared to 1/60 (1.7%) of
normal controls, P = 0.6. Both duration and severity
were not associated with ANA positivity. ATAs were
detected positive in 17/139 (12%) of patients compared to
none of the normal controls P = 0.004. In three of these
patients disthyroidism was detected by low TT4 and high
TSH; however, thyroid replacement did not change the
course of CU. Total IgE was found elevated (considered
elevated only when >200 U + 2 SD) in 32/139 (23%)
compared to 3/60 (5%) in the control group P = 0.02.

The association of CU duration with clinical parameters (angioedema and severity), and laboratory parameters (AST, ATA, and total IgE) was analyzed in all
patients studied as follows:

Relation between CU duration and severity: Whereas
urticaria resolved in all patients with mild CU within
24 months, moderate to severe CU persisted in 59% of
patients up to 24 months, and in 32% up to 60 months,
P < 0.0001 (Table 1).

With angioedema: At 12 months of follow-up, 88 and
80% of angioedema-positive and angioedema-negative
patients were still suffering from urticaria attacks,
respectively. However, at 24 months of follow-up 64%
of angioedema-positive patients in contrast to 43% of
angioedema-negative patients were still presenting CU
hives. When this association was analyzed further up to
5 years 45% of patients with existing angioedema were
still having CU as compared to only 12% of angioedemanegative patients, P = 0.002 (see Fig. 1).

Parameters in predicting chronic urticaria duration

In relation with AST: AST was defined positive in 36/
126 (28%) of patients and in none among the normal
individuals, P = 0.0001. In this regard, when CU duration was analyzed in relation to AST, significant
differences were already present at 12 months of followup: CU still existed in 94% of AST-positive patients, in
contrast to 78% of AST-negative patients. At 24 months,
72% of AST-positive patients were still suffering from
CU, in contrast to 43% of AST-negative patients. Of
interest is that at 5 years of follow-up both AST-positive
and AST-negative patients presented similar rates. Differences in CU duration between AST-positive and ASTnegative were significant when considering the whole
period, P = 0.004 (see Fig. 2). Also, we could not
demonstrate a correlation between CU duration and
AST score among patients with positive AST.

CU duration in relation to ATA: At 12 months differences in CU rates between ATA-positive and ASTnegative patients were noticed (94 vs 82%, respectively).
At 24 months, 70% of ATA-positive patients (as opposed
to 50% of ATA-negative patients) still suffered from CU.
At 5 years of follow-up, 52% of ATA-positive patients vs
16% of ATA-negative presented CU attacks, P = 0.02
(see Fig. 3).

Though relative to normal individuals, total IgE was
found to be elevated among CU patients, this elevation
was not found to have a significant association with either
disease duration or CU severity.

The association of CU severity with other parameters
Angioedema was documented in 47/111 patients suffering
from moderate to severe CU, and in 9/28 of mild CU

patients. ATA was found positive in 3/28 mild CU
patients and in 14/111 of moderate to severe CU patients.

Whereas neither parameter was found in association with
CU severity, both were found to have a significant
association with CU duration. Positive AST was documented in 33/104 moderate to severe CU patients;
however, only 3/22 patients with mild CU were AST
positive, thus AST positivity presents a trend towards a
significant association with CU severity, P = 0.08.

Discussion

The wide clinical spectrum of urticaria (i.e. distribution of
hives, the invariable intensity of itch, and the duration of
disease) indicate that multiple mediators are involved in
the polymorphism and variable behavior of this disorder
(24, 25). The occasional appearance of angioedema
during the course of CU occurred in approximately
50% of patients. However, neither angioedema nor CU
severity, have been evaluated in conjunction with other
laboratory parameters as possible predictors of CU
duration or as means by which to distinguish between
autoimmune and nonautoimmune CU.

The reports of Leznof (26) were the first to show an
association between thyroid autoimmunity and CU. Such
an association was further supported in other studies in
which both thyroglobulin and thyroid microsomal antibodies were found increased (27). The prevalence of
thyroid function alterations in such patients as well as the
efficacy of correcting these alterations has been discussed
in many studies but remains questionable (9). In a most
recent report (28), higher incidence of ATA was found in
CU patients in whom anti-IgE receptor antibodies were
positive. This is compatible with our finding of the
association between AST positivity and the presence of
ATA. However, the association between thyroid autoim
872

munity and CU severity and duration has not been
investigated in the past.

Interest in the possible autoimmune origin of CU was
further strengthened with the identification of IgG
autoantibodies directed against FceRIo or IgE on mast
cells (29, 30). But since these disease-specific histaminereleasing autoantibodies were found in not more than
50% of cases, other circulatory factors were proposed to
play a role in mast cell degranulation such as metalloproteinases and cytokines such as TNF-« and IL-10
(31, 32). The production of various and unrelated
autoantibodies in CU (AST and ATA) might be driven
by polyclonal T-helper-cell activity, rather than distinct
monoclonal auto-reactive T-cells and therefore were
suggested to be only associate autoimmune markers.
We propose that our current finding of total IgE elevation
is a part of this polyclonal activity rather than due to a
specific trigger. This is consistent with our previous
documentation of increased proliferation and overexpression of Bcl-2 in both B and T lymphocytes derived
from CU patients (33). Following this understanding of
CU being a T-cell-dependent disorder, the beneficial
effects of CsA in severe CU become highly reasonable, in
addition to its histamine-releasing inhibitory effect.

In this study, we demonstrate that CU lasted over | year
in more than 70% of patients. After 36 months of followup, 43% of patients were still suffering from CU, and by
the end of the study, 14% of patients were still suffering
from CU. In this regard, the natural history of urticaria
reveals that management should be directed toward
allowing the patient to maintain an acceptable quality of
life, until the episode resolves. Since most reports on CsA
treatment suggest its initiation only when severe CU lasts
over | year, we propose that, as it is customary in the
management of autoimmune diseases, the early initiation
of CsA be considered in severe CU cases.

The early identification of patients in whom urticaria is
expected to be long lasting and/or severe is desirable.
A significant contribution of the current study is that our
findings suggest a strong association between CU duration with the presence of angioedema, AST, and ATA.
Whereas our results reinforce earlier findings suggesting
an association between AST and CU severity (34), the
current study is the first to associate AST with CU
duration. Based on these findings, the early initiation of
CsA among patients exhibiting severe CU along with
AST positivity may be considered, especially when
angioedema and ATA are also present, since in such
patients one may predict CU to also be long standing.

Just how autoimmunity is related to CU duration and
severity remains unclear and requires further investigation. One possibility is that long-lasting CU is the result
of a prolonged stimulation of T-cells followed by
prolonged polyclonal activation, and the production of
various cytokines that could possibly induce the secretion
of the autoantibodies discussed above. We are cognizant
of the high incidence of moderate to severe CU among

 

 
our study population which could be explained by the
higher referral rate of such patients to specialized
outpatient clinics. Additional studies should be conduc
