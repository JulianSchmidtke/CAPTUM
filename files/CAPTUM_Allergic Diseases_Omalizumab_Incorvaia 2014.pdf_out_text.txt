Abstract: A large number of trials show that the anti-immunoglobulin (Ig) E antibody omalizumab
is very effective in patients with severe allergic asthma. This is acknowledged in consensus documents. The drug also has a good safety profile and a pharmacoeconomic advantage due to a
reduction in the number of hospitalizations for asthma attacks. In recent years, some studies have
shown that omalizumab is effective also in nonallergic asthma. Effects on the complex signaling
mechanisms leading to activation of effector cells and to mediator release may account for this
outcome. Indeed, omalizumab has been reported to be effective in a number of IgE-mediated
and non-IgE-mediated disorders. Concerning the former, clinical efficacy has been observed in
rhinitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, latex allergy, atopic dermatitis, allergic urticaria,
and anaphylaxis. In addition, omalizumab has been demonstrated to be able to prevent systemic
reactions to allergen immunotherapy, thus enabling completion of treatment in patients who
otherwise would have to stop it. Concerning non-IgE-mediated disorders, omalizumab has been
reported to be effective in nasal polyposis, autoimmune urticaria, chronic idiopathic urticaria,
physical urticaria, idiopathic angioedema, and mastocytosis. Current indications for treatment
with omalizumab are confined to severe allergic asthma. Consequently, any other prescription can
only be off-label. However, it is reasonable to expect that the use of omalizumab will be approved
for particularly important indications, such as anaphylaxis, in the near future.

Introduction

Among the human antibodies, the immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies were the last
class to be discovered, due to their very low blood concentrations.' Soon after their
discovery, an in vitro test was introduced for measuring IgE that helped greatly to
improve our understanding of allergic disease.’

IgE plays a central role in the pathophysiology of allergic disease. Once IgE reaches
the bloodstream, it binds to the high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) on the surface of
mast cells and basophils and, upon contact with a specific allergen, induces the release
of pharmacologically active mediators stored in the granules of these cells, resulting
in clinical manifestations of type I hypersensitivity.’ The ability to treat IgE-mediated
diseases with an anti-IgE antibody was theorized back in the 1970s with the experiments
of Kohler and Milstein.* However, it took a long time to overcome the problems preventing use of anti-IgE antibodies in allergic subjects, such as humanization (from
prototype mouse antibody), removal of anaphylactogenic potential (anti-IgE sera were
used for decades to study the release of mediators of anaphylaxis from mast cells and

basophils in vitro), and the risk of parasitic infections. The
biological agent known as omalizumab finally proved to possess adequate characteristics for use in IgE-mediated allergies*® as a result of its particular mechanism of action. This
mechanism can be summarized as follows: binding to free
IgE, thus reducing cell-bound IgE; reduction in high affinity
FceRI receptors; reduction in mediator release; and reduction
in allergic inflammation (Figures | and 2). The ideal condition
for treatment with omalizumab is severe allergic asthma not
controlled by conventional drug treatment at doses ranging
from a minimum of 75 mg up to 600 mg (1-4 injections)
every 2 weeks, according to total IgE levels, which must
not exceed 600 IU/mL and actually range between 30 and
1,500 IU/mL. Recently, the drug has been approved for
therapeutic use in children aged 6-12 years. Adult and
adolescent patients with IgE below 76 IU/mL and children
with IgE below 200 IU/mL must have reactivity (RAST) to
a perennial allergen before starting therapy (Tables 1-3). At
the recommended dosage, omalizumab achieved a significant reduction in free IgE within 24 to 48 hours of the first
subcutaneous administration and a significant reduction in
clinical symptoms within a week.’ A large number of controlled studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of
omalizumab in allergic asthma. The present review assesses
further studies of omalizumab in asthma and new indications,
including nonallergic disorders.

Regarding safety, the therapeutic use of omalizumab in
clinical practice was at first restricted on account of the risk
of anaphylactic reactions. This risk has been considerably
reduced both by the introduction of a ready-to-use solution
formulation of the drug and by experience following the

increase in exposed patient populations within the context of
clinical studies and post-marketing surveillance initiatives.

A study® analyzed the safety of omalizumab using
data from completed clinical studies involving more than
7,500 patients with asthma, rhinitis, or related conditions
treated for up to one year and data from a study of patients
with severe allergic asthma treated for up to 4 years, as well
as post-marketing safety data for omalizumab. The drug
showed a good safety and tolerability profile. The incidence
of anaphylaxis was 0.14% in omalizumab-treated patients
and 0.07% in control patients. Post-marketing data, based
on estimated exposure of 57,300 patients (June 2003 to
December 2006), showed that the frequency of anaphylaxis
attributed to omalizumab use was estimated to be at least
0.2%. The incidence of anaphylaxis in the controlled studies
(investigator-reported) was rare (omalizumab 0.14% versus
control 0.07%).

This rate is similar to the incidence of anaphylactic
reactions for other drugs, such as oral penicillins, aspirin,
and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,’ as well as to
the incidence and prevalence of anaphylaxis reported in the
general omalizumab-free population (about 0.05%-2%).!°"?
Post-marketing data have also highlighted that anaphylaxis
may occur not only after first administration of omalizumab, but also after subsequent administrations and after
longer post-administration periods than those monitored in
clinical trials.°

At present, the most interesting aspect is the high number of publications reporting the efficacy of omalizumab
in a number of different diseases, including, unexpectedly,
diseases that hitherto have been considered to be non-IgEmediated. This phenomenon is such that there is a current

 

trend of using omalizumab as a probe to assess the role of
IgE in human disease.'* However, it must be taken into
account that the identification of new therapeutic activity
for omalizumab does not allow its therapeutic use in that
specific condition (except off-label usage), because the only
approved indication at this time is severe perennial allergic
asthma not controlled by conventional therapy.

Omalizumab in asthma

In 2006, a systematic Cochrane review analyzed the efficacy
of omalizumab in allergic asthma based on data obtained
from 14 placebo-controlled studies including a total of
3,143 patients. The results led the authors to draw the conclusion that omalizumab is effective. A significant number of
patients were able to reduce their dose of inhaled steroids,
which are the mainstay of asthma therapy, by more than 50%

or even discontinue them completely, with an odds ratio of
2.50 in both cases.'* Other trials were conducted in recent
years and confirmed that omalizumab improves symptom
control, reducing the frequency of asthma exacerbations
and the need to use high doses of inhaled corticosteroids,
thus fulfilling an important need in patients with moderate
to severe asthma.' In particular, a recent trial by Busse et al
demonstrated that omalizumab significantly reduces disease
exacerbations and hospitalizations compared with placebo
in inner city children with asthma.'*

Useful information in terms of current practice is also
provided by real-life studies, which are certainly different from the environment of controlled trials. A Belgian
study of 158 asthmatic patients with frequent symptoms

and exacerbations in the previous year, despite treatment
with high doses of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting
B2-agonists, showed that treatment with omalizumab
was associated with an absence of exacerbations in
more than 65% of patients after one year, as well with
improved quality of life in 84% of patients.'? The clinical benefit in real-life conditions, including a significant
reduction in emergency department visits and hospitalizations, was confirmed in recent studies in adults'*?° and
children.”!

Further progress was made by conducting a placebocontrolled trial in 41 adult patients with severe, nonatopic,
refractory asthma despite optimal treatment. The change
in FceRI expression on blood basophils and plasmacytoid
dendritic cells was evaluated after 16 weeks, along with
the impact of omalizumab on lung function and clinical
variables. Compared with placebo, treatment with omalizumab resulted in a statistically significant reduction in
FceRI expression on basophils and plasmacytoid dendritic
cells (P<0.001) and an overall increase in forced expiratory
volume in one second compared with baseline. The authors
concluded that omalizumab regulates FceRI expression
negatively in patients with severe nonatopic asthma, as it
does in severe atopic asthma.” This accounts for a possible
role of IgE in nonatopic asthma. A potential explanation for
this outcome was provided by Barnes, who suggested that
asthmatic inflammation, which is characterized by a predominance of Th2 lymphocytes with the related cytokine profile,

by mast cell activation and eosinophilic infiltration can be
triggered by superantigens. Such superantigens include
Staphylococcus aureus antigens, which are able to activate
production of polyclonal IgE (including specific IgE against
the same superantigens) locally in the respiratory tract. On
the other hand, the role of superantigens was previously
suggested by Marone et al concerning allergic disorders
in general.** Further support for these additional effects of
omalizumab has been provided by studies showing that its
action extends to the complex signaling mechanism, leading
to activation of effector cells and release of mediators. In
fact, treatment with omalizumab can modify the expression
of Syk, a tyrosine kinase of central importance in the signaling mechanism, which leads to the final opening of calcium
channels and degranulation,”> as well as to modulation of
the FceRI-B/o ratio.”°

Interestingly, the effectiveness of omalizumab was also
recently reported in patients with severe occupational asthma
caused by both high and low molecular weight compounds,
with most treated patients being able to continue their activity
at the same workplace.’

An important step forward concerns a matter for which
no information has been available, ie, duration of treatment.
A follow-up study by Nopp et al showed that, after 6 years of
treatment, most patients had (surprisingly, according to the
authors) mild and stable asthma in the 3 ensuing years and
at the same time showed downregulation of the sensitivity

of basophils to specific allergens.** This supports the role of
omalizumab as a therapeutic agent for nonspecific immunotherapy. In fact, omalizumab acts on IgE regardless of allergen
specificity, while specific immunotherapy (SIT) acts exclusively
on allergen-specific IgE. This was the first indication that a
6-year course of treatment is adequate, as is the case for SIT,”
but this finding must be confirmed by further studies.

The fact that omalizumab continues to work after
discontinuation indicates additional benefit in terms of
cost-effectiveness, which, despite the high cost of the drug,
was clearly demonstrated by recent studies.°°*? In particular, in the latest study, it was found that in the one year
prior to omalizumab therapy the per-person rate of asthma
exacerbations was 3.39 compared with 1.07 in the year of
taking omalizumab. Using the pharmacoeconomic index
of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), the discounted
incremental lifetime additional costs for omalizumab were
€55,865 for 1.46 additional QALYs, resulting in €38,371 per
QALY. This supports the claim that the cost-effectiveness
ratio related to achievement of fewer exacerbations in the
omalizumab-treated asthma population is attractive.*> The
outcome of the significant reduction in asthma exacerbations
is in agreement with our current practice; in our patients,
the mean numbers of emergency department visits and
hospitalizations were found to be 5.6 and 3.2, respectively,
before treatment compared with 1.2 and 0.8 after treatment
with omalizumab.

The persistence of the effects of omalizumab may be
related to the ability of the drug to curtail airway remodeling in
patients with asthma. Ina study aimed at assessing the effects
of omalizumab on airway wall thickness by computed tomography, treatment with omalizumab significantly (P<0.01)
decreased the airway wall area (corrected for body surface
area, WA/BSA), percentage wall area (WA%), wall thickness
[(T)VBSA], and luminal area [(Ai)/BSA] of the right apical
bronchial segments, whereas conventional therapy resulted in
no change. A significant mean reduction in thickness of the
reticular basement membrane and eosinophil infiltration in
bronchial biopsies from patients with severe persistent allergic
asthma was recorded after one year of omalizumab treatment
using light microscopic image analysis.** This evidence suggests that omalizumab may have a role in modifying the course
of the disease by curtailing airway remodeling during severe
persistent allergic asthma.

Further therapeutic activity
of omalizumab: off-label indications

Allergic rhinitis and nasal polyposis
In view of the close relationship between allergic rhinitis
and asthma, the efficacy of omalizumab in the treatment

of concomitant rhinitis in patients with asthma was to be
expected.***’ A parallel response of the two allergic reactions was shown, and in one trial the odds ratio for a positive
effect on rhinitis corresponded to 3.56, ie, the probability was
three and a half times higher in subjects with improvement
of asthma compared with nonresponders.**

The effect of omalizumab on nasal polyps is less obvious, because polyposis often occurs in nonallergic subjects.
However, in nasal polyposis, local activation of polyclonal
IgE similar to that reported previously for intrinsic asthma
may occur. S. aureus, the enterotoxins of which act as
superantigens, also plays an important role in this condition.
Verbruggen et al proposed a “proof-of-concept” trial with
omalizumab in nasal polyposis, which, in the event of a
positive response, would pave the way for treatment of this
disease using anti-IgE agents.*? The results of the trial are
pending. However, favorable results are already available
from a pilot study conducted in the US, which included
a group treated with omalizumab and a control group.*°
Collectively, this trial shows a direct relationship between
severity of nasal polyposis and pretreatment total serum IgE
levels, with no differences between the groups with regard
to their total serum IgE levels, sinus computed tomography

scores, and endoscopically determined nasal polyposis
scores assessed preoperatively. Compared with preoperative
values, nasal polyposis scores were significantly improved
in the anti-[gE group, whereas the control group showed no
significant improvement.

Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is caused by an
excessive response of Th2 lymphocytes to Aspergillus
fumigatus, a ubiquitous mold. Allergic bronchopulmonary
aspergillosis develops in a small proportion of patients with
asthma, but patients with cystic fibrosis may also be affected,
suggesting that intrinsic host defects play a major role in
susceptibility to this disease.*! The efficacy of omalizumab
has been demonstrated in case reports’? * and also in case
series. 4’ The treatment was found to be efficacious with
regard to clinical parameters for allergic bronchopulmonary
aspergillosis and also had a steroid-sparing effect.

Skin disorders

The first skin disease in which omalizumab was assessed
was atopic dermatitis. Several reports on limited case
series were published initially,’ followed by a pilot study
in 21 subjects.” In the pilot study, patients were stratified
according to IgE level (very high, >700 IU/mL; high,
186-700 IU/mL; normal, =185 IU/mL), with an average pretreatment level corresponding to 1,521 IU/mL. All patients
showed significant improvement in their clinical scores for
atopic dermatitis. In a placebo-controlled trial, omalizumab
reduced free serum IgE levels, lowered surface IgE and FceRI
expression on mononuclear cells, reduced the saturation of
FceRI with IgE, increased the number of free FceRI, and
lowered the number of IgE+, but not the number of FceRI+
cells in skin.*° The in vivo relevance of these results is shown
by the increased threshold allergen concentration required
to trigger a type I hypersensitivity reaction on skin testing.
Treatment with omalizumab led to improved atopy patch
test results in individual patients, ie, an eczematous reaction
upon epicutaneous allergen challenge. The interference with
immediate and delayed skin tests implies that a therapeutic
benefit for omalizumab would be seen in patients with acute
rather than chronic forms of the disease.

Urticaria is a skin disorder sustained by a number of
mechanisms that do not usually include IgE mediation.
Therefore, the positive results obtained in this condition were
the most surprising: an initial report of complete resolution
of a case of cold urticaria with omalizumab*' was followed
by therapeutic success in urticaria caused by heat and

delayed pressure,* as well as in solar and cholinergic*?
urticaria. However, there are also negative reports in the lat
ter two conditions.*°

°7 One study also reported the efficacy
of omalizumab in subjects with angioedema classified as
idiopathic.**

Within this context, omalizumab can be used as a probe to
assess the relative importance of IgE-mediated mechanisms
in the various clinical forms of urticaria/angioedema. From
this point of view, the most important clinical application is
chronic urticaria, including its idiopathic and autoimmune
variants, which cover most cases. In a first report on three
patients resistant to antihistamine therapy, one with low levels
of total IgE, one with high levels, and one with high levels
of both IgE antibodies and anti-IgE receptor antibodies,
complete remission of urticaria was observed in two patients
within a week and in the other within 6 weeks.* In a study
of autoimmune urticaria not controlled by antihistamines,
including 12 patients with positive autologous serum skin
and histamine release tests, all patients received omalizumab
following 4 weeks of treatment with placebo, and showed
significant improvement in clinical scores (complete resolution in seven cases), a significant decrease in consumption
of drugs used for symptomatic relief, and improvement
in quality of life, with only one patient not responding to
treatment.

A recent multicenter, randomized, double-blind, Phase HI
study evaluated the efficacy and safety of omalizumab ina
large population of patients with moderate to severe chronic
idiopathic urticaria, who remained symptomatic despite
antihistamine therapy at the licensed doses; 323 patients
received three doses of 75 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg, or
placebo at 4-week intervals, followed by a 16-week observation period. At week 12, the mean change from baseline
in weekly itch severity score was —5.1£5.6 in the placebo
group, —5.9+6.5 in the 75 mg group (P=0.46), —8.1+6.4 in
the 150 mg group (P=0.001), and —9.8+6.0 in the 300 mg
group (P<0.001). The rate of adverse events was similar
across the groups. These findings show that omalizumab
reduces clinical symptoms and signs of chronic idiopathic urticaria in patients resistant to approved doses of
antihistamines.”!

Mastocytosis is another skin disease with systemic effects
that has stimulated research on the role of omalizumab in
prophylaxis of this condition. The first two studies reporting
clinical efficacy suggested to the authors that omalizumab
might inhibit the alleged stimulation of survival and accumulation of mast cells by IgE° and downregulation of the
FceRI receptor.® It is well known that mastocytosis is a risk

factor for severe, life-threatening reactions to Hymenoptera
stings and also for reactions to venom immunotherapy.”
It was reported that omalizumab, albeit at high doses, is
able to prevent the reactions to venom immunotherapy in
patients with mastocytosis.°+°> Another report concerned a
patient with indolent mastocytosis and a history of repeated
anaphylactic episodes without any apparent cause. Following
treatment with low doses of omalizumab (150 mg per month),
the patient did not experience any further episodes of anaphylaxis, and showed a reduction in tryptase levels from
25.4 to 14 ng/mL and a decrease in basophil activation, as
indicated by a decrease in mean fluorescence intensity from
120 to 22; such an index is correlated with a decrease in IgE,
which occurs in all subjects given its biological role on the
cell surface.”

Food-related anaphylaxis

In addition to its promising effects in mastocytosis, important effects were obtained for omalizumab in anaphylaxis
induced by food, which is a major cause of fatal events
related to hypersensitivity reactions.*’ A placebo-controlled
trial tested the effects of anti-[gE therapy on reactions to
peanuts, the dominant cause of food-related anaphylaxis in
the US. Eighty-four patients were randomized to receive
150, 300, or 450 mg of omalizumab or placebo. The 450 mg
dose demonstrated superior efficacy, increasing the amount
of peanut tolerated from 178 mg (approximately half a
peanut) to 2.8 g (about nine peanuts), thereby removing
the risk of anaphylaxis due to inadvertent consumption of
small amounts.

One of the most striking observations is the ability of
omalizumab to prevent so-called idiopathic anaphylaxis
(ie, caused by unidentified triggers).-”? Another clinical
form of anaphylaxis successfully prevented by omalizumab
is exercise-induced anaphylaxis,’! which is a clinical
syndrome (presenting as food-dependent or nonfooddependent) in which anaphylaxis occurs in conjunction
with physical exercise and for which the pathophysiology
is still uncertain.”

Food allergy

Food hypersensitivity is associate:

 

not only with anaphylaxis
but also with a number of other clinical conditions. A recent
study evaluated the efficacy of omalizumab in 22 patients
receiving treatment for asthma who had concomitant food
allergy.” The average concentration of total IgE was
1,120 IU/mL and the culprit foods were fish, shellfish, eggs,
peanuts, tree nuts, soy, and wheat. Clinical improvement in

reactions was observed after the sixth dose of omalizumab,
in particular in nine patients affected by angioedema with or
without anaphylaxis, in eight patients with atopic dermatitis,
in six patients with rhinosinusitis, and in three patients with
urticaria. In another study of 14 patients with peanut allergy,
clinical and cellular responses were assessed during treatment
with omalizumab for 6 months. At baseline, all subjects
underwent a double-blind, placebo-controlled oral food
challenge and a skin prick test titration, with measurement
of basophil histamine release in response to peanut exposure.
Basophil histamine release was repeated at week 2 and then
weekly until it decreased to less than 20% of baseline values.
The oral food challenges and skin prick test titrations were
repeated after reduction of basophil histamine release (or at
week 8 if basophil histamine release did not decrease) and
again at 6 months. Omalizumab induced a significant increase
in the threshold dose for oral food challenge with peanuts
causing allergic symptoms (from 80 to 6,500 mg, P<0.01);
peanut-induced basophil histamine release was completely
suppressed in five patients and reduced by ten-fold in nine
patients; and after 6 months of treatment, a significant suppression in skin prick test titration was also observed. The
fact that the clinical response to omalizumab occurred early
during treatment when basophils, but not mast cells, were
suppressed, suggests that basophils have a role in acute food
reactions.”

Another clinical form of food allergy involves the
gastrointestinal system, and includes food allergy with
gastrointestinal eosinophilia. A case series of patients with
eosinophilic gastroenteritis showed that a 16-week course
of omalizumab achieved not only a reduction in symptoms,
but also a reduction in eosinophil counts, amounting to
35%—45% in blood and to 60%—70% in the duodenum and
antrum.” The same investigators performed a study aimed at
determining whether anti-IgE therapy, by blocking facilitated
antigen presentation in vivo, attenuates allergen-specific
Th? cell responses, but no significant difference in indices
of T cell function was detected.” Eosinophilic esophagitis
is a disorder of increasing interest in which food allergens,
as well as inhaled allergens, play a causative role.” In one
report, two patients with multiple food allergies and eosinophilic esophagitis were treated with omalizumab and showed
significant improvement in symptoms, despite negligible
histologic and endoscopic responses.”

Other disorders
There are case reports describing the efficacy of omalizumab
in other disorders, including both IgE-mediated diseases

and disorders of unknown pathogenesis. Latex allergy is
clearly an IgE-mediated condition and may be associated
with a variety of clinical manifestations, including asthma,
rhinitis, urticaria, dermatitis, and anaphylaxis.” In a placebocontrolled trial, 12 latex-allergic health care workers showed
a reduction in conjunctival and cutaneous responses to latex
after treatment with omalizumab.°

Atopic keratoconjunctivitis is a severe ocular disorder that can cause blindness.*! In an open-label trial, six
patients treated with omalizumab showed improvement in
ocular symptoms.” This positive outcome is supported by
a case report showing a marked reduction in the use of oral
steroids.’ Hyper-IgE syndrome is reported as a possible
further application; in one case report, treatment with 450 mg
of omalizumab every 2 weeks produced complete resolution
of skin manifestations in a 26-year-old woman.* Once again,
omalizumab proved to be effective in disorders unrelated to
IgE-mediated hypersensitivity, such as interstitial cystitis,**
bullous pemphigoid,** chronic rhinosinusitis,*’ and aspirinexacerbated respiratory disease.**

Combination of omalizumab
and SIT

It is easily understandable that the combination of SIT and
omalizumab is “virtuous” in improving the tolerability
profile and clinical results.’° These two aspects are obviously related to each other, because patients with adverse
reactions to SIT are unlikely to have the same clinical
benefit as those who tolerate the treatment. In fact, the
cumulative dose received will inevitably be lower, and the
concept of dose dependence regarding the effectiveness of
SIT is not up for discussion.” A randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study of 248 patients treated with perennial allergens (house dust mite, cat and dog epithelium)
confirmed these observations, showing that treatment
with omalizumab was associated with significantly fewer
asthmatic and systemic adverse reactions compared with
placebo, and enabled achievement of the usual maintenance
dose.°! Other studies have assessed safety in 221 children
treated with SIT for seasonal allergy, also documenting an
excellent tolerability profile (including local reactions to
the vaccine) in patients treated with omalizumab” and the
superior efficacy of SIT in 140 patients of any age with seasonal allergy.” In this case, the combination of omalizumab
and SIT had significantly superior effects to SIT alone with
regard to intensity of symptoms (P=0.004), and achieved
better control of asthma (P=0.029) and improved quality
of life (P=0.029).

There are also studies of SIT with Hymenoptera venom.
The effects of omalizumab in preventing adverse reactions
to SIT in patients with mastocytosis have already been
discussed, but another area of concern is the safety of
SIT with bee venom, which is much less well tolerated
than vespid venom.” Several case reports have shown
the ability to prevent anaphylactic reactions to SIT with
bee venom, thus enabling immunization of patients.°*°
However, this was not possible in one case.”* The patient in
question, who did not tolerate previous attempts with SIT
and had a high level of specific IgE for bee venom, was
treated with 300 mg of omalizumab at monthly intervals
for 6 months, starting with a rush schedule 2 weeks after
the last administration. It is possible that a higher dose of
omalizumab or administration of the drug closer to initiation of SIT could be protective.

On the whole, addition of omalizumab to SIT seems to
be beneficial, but the cost of the drug is so high that this
combination cannot be used routinely. However, use of
omalizumab is warranted in patients with asthma that cannot
be controlled by standard drug treatment (and thus excluded
from SIT) and in patients unable to reach the maintenance
dose of venom immunotherapy because of repeated adverse
reactions.

Conclusion

An increasing number of omalizumab studies are providing new information on the role of IgE-mediated mechanisms in various diseases, which sometimes was totally
unexpected because IgE was not known to be involved
in their pathogenesis. However, at present, omalizumab
is approved for therapeutic use only in allergic asthma
not controlled by conventional therapy, so there is a
discrepancy between the information available in new
indications and actual applicability. Consequently, translating the new knowledge into actual treatment remains
theoretical until the new indications are authorized. There
is agreement among experts on some applications, such as
anaphylaxis (both food-induced and idiopathic), chronic
urticaria, and the combination of omalizumab with SIT
in selected cases, which should all be considered to be

new indications.°? '

Moreover, further evaluation of the
efficacy of omalizumab in larger patient populations in
clinical practice in any disorder should include an assessment of the economic impact of this agent, given that
this aspect is very important for the regulatory agencies
responsible for scientific evaluation and authorization of

medicinal products.
