Abstract

Allergic rhinitis (AR) and chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) are
highly burdensome diseases, which are increasing in prevalence, especially in the paediatric population. Despite the
availability of a large number of medications for treatment
of AR and CIU, their use in children has primarily been based
on data obtained from a limited number of clinical trials in
children and/or testing in adults. The H;-antihistamines have
traditionally been used as first-line treatment for the relief of
both AR and CIU symptoms in children. The first-generation
H,-antihistamines are associated with marked adverse effects such as sedation, sleepiness/drowsiness as well as difficulties in learning and cognitive processing; thus, they are
recommended for limited or discontinued use in children
with AR or CIU. In contrast, second-generation H;-antihistamines are more adapted for the use in children with AR and
CIU due to better safety profiles. However, only a limited
number of trials with these agents have been conducted and

generally, data from well-designed trials in children are lacking. Levocetirizine is one of the most extensively investigated H,-antihistamines for its pharmacologic properties, safety, efficacy as well as overall global satisfaction in children
aged 2-12 years. Levocetirizine is the only H;-antihistamine
launched in the 21st century shown to lack clinically relevant
adverse effects on physical and psychomotor development
or routine laboratory tests over a long-term period of 18
months in 1- to 3-year-old children predisposed to development of allergic disease. Available data suggest that levocetirizine is a suitable treatment option for AR and CIU in children aged 6 months to 12 years.

Introduction

Evidence suggests that children do not generally respond to medications in the same way as adults, primarily due to differences in the metabolism, renal clearance
and other drug disposition mechanisms associated with
anatomical, physiological and developmental differences
(1, 2]. Moreover, there are age-related differences among
children in their ability to metabolise, absorb, excrete
and transform medications [3, 4]. As paediatric formula

tions, especially for children under 6 years of age, are
usually in a liquid form, special knowledge and skills are
necessary to make them stable, sterile, pleasant tasting,
long lasting and with favourable pharmacokinetic (PK)
as well as pharmacodynamic (PD) properties. Besides efficacy, compliance is also an important issue and adherence to treatment in the school-age children may be enhanced by pleasant taste, smell and ease of use of medication [5, 6]. Similarly, specifically designed instruments,
such as dropper pipettes are important for both convenient delivery and accurate dosing of liquid formulations, particularly because tableware teaspoons can vary
in capacity and dosing errors may occur unless a measuring instrument is provided with the medication [7]. It
is thus not surprising that development of paediatric formulations and the research associated with their development is often difficult and subject to several barriers,
including ethical, economic, logistical, technical and
regulatory ones [7-10]. Despite the general principles of
the international guideline ICH E-11 [4], which dictate
that paediatric patients should be given medicines that
have been properly evaluated in the paediatric population with particular consideration of the PK/PD properties, efficacy and safety of the medicine in the relevant
age categories [4], it is thought that 50-75% of the drugs
prescribed for children have not been tested in paediatric
populations [7].

Anti-allergic drugs, particularly the antihistamines
and intranasal steroids, are among the most commonly
prescribed medications in children as allergic rhinitis
(AR) is currently one of the most common chronic disorder in the paediatric population. An increasing body of
evidence indicates that allergies are becoming more persistent and complex, with most of today’s AR patients being sensitised to multiple triggers and experiencing more
severe and persistent symptoms [11]. It has been suggested that the increase in severity and persistence of symptoms of AR may be associated with multiple sensitisation
and sustained exposure to traditional indoor allergens
such as fungal and mould spores [12, 13], as well as with
prolonged exposure, due to extended pollen seasons, to
perennial tree pollen, food and pet allergens [11]. Similarly, there is evidence that fossil fuel- (kerosene and gas)
generated air pollutants in the home [11], indoor cleaning
products [14], diet [15, 16] and psychological stress [11, 17]
may increase the risk and/or sensitisation to allergens and
contribute to the increasing prevalence of symptoms of
AR.

Epidemiological studies suggest that the prevalence of
AR has increased progressively over the past 30 years in

 

368 Int Arch Allergy Immunol 2011;155:367-378

westernised societies and presently affects up to 40% of
the population worldwide [18,19], with data from Europe
indicating between 23 and 30% of the population being
affected [20, 21] and data from the US indicating between
10 and 30% of adults being affected [22]. Importantly,
data from studies in 6- to 14-year-old children have indicated that the prevalence of AR has doubled over the past
two decades [23-26], with up to 40% of children being affected [22, 27]. More recent data suggest that the prevalence of AR in children is still on the increase worldwide,
although there are large variations among the countries,
with more low- to mid-income countries showing increased prevalence [28].

The health and socioeconomic impact of AR on adults
and society alike is well documented [29-32]. Reviews of
studies in children have similarly indicated that the burden of AR in children is great. The symptoms of AR,
apart from being bothersome, have the potential to lead
to both physical and mental complications in children
[31, 33]. The physical complications are often associated
with co-morbid conditions, including otitis media and
effusion, recurrent and/or chronic sinusitis, snoring and
asthma, whereas the mental complications are associated
with sleep, poor school performance and hyperactivity,
which can result in increased disturbances in learning,
performance, behaviour and mood [31, 33]. Indeed, the
Pediatric Allergies in America survey [34] has recently
provided compelling evidence that children with nasal
allergies experience substantially more physical, mental,
emotional and social problems than children who do not
have allergies, and that the increased burden of sympoms frequently undermines restful sleep, leading to impairments in learning and cognition through absenteeism as well as activity avoidance [34]. The survey also
indicated that healthcare providers overestimated the paients’ and parents’ satisfaction with disease management
as well as the benefit of medications used for the treatment of nasal allergies in children, thus suggesting that
he burden of AR on children was likely to be significantly underestimated [34].

 

Management of AR in Paediatric Patients

Treatment of AR in children involves the use of a variety of medications together with allergen and irritant
avoidance measures, and can often be achieved in primary care for most patients [35]. Pharmacologic management encompasses the use of both over-the-counter
(OTC) and prescription drugs including oral and intra
 

Pampura/Papadopoulos/Spiéak/Kurzawa
nasal H,-antihistamines, intranasal steroids (INS), decongestants, cromones, anti-leukotrienes and immunotherapy, of which the antihistamines and INS are most
frequently used as first-line treatment, depending on the
severity of symptoms of AR [34, 35]. Decongestants are
advised to be used for short periods of time, while antileukotrienes are increasingly used in patients with both
AR and asthma.

Although immunotherapy has recently gained popularity in some parts of the world, this form of therapy may
not always be available or possible, especially as it needs
to be performed over a long period and under supervision
by fully trained physicians [35]. Moreover, a systematic
review of randomised controlled trials evaluating the effects of inhalant allergen immunotherapy (by cutaneous-, sublingual-, nasal- or oral-specific administration)
on symptoms and medication use in 1,619 children and
adolescents with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis showed that
evidence for efficacy was conflicting and varied from being moderate to not effective [36]. As immunotherapy often involves treatment with a single allergen extract over
a period of 3 years or more, it is possible that variation in
efficacy documented by this systematic review was at
least partly a consequence of sensitisation to multiple allergens and differences in experimental setting and design, patient selection and other parameters related to
immunotherapy. Nevertheless, a position paper from the
World Allergy Organisation has recently indicated that
while subcutaneous immunotherapy is not generally prescribed to young children, primarily because of safety
concerns, sublingual immunotherapy may lead to adverse events in 5-15% of the children younger than 5
years of age [37]. Furthermore, there are still many unmet
needs with sublingual immunotherapy use in children,
among which are the lack of optimal dose and dosing frequency of allergen administration, lack of data for longterm efficacy, duration of treatment, preventive capacity,
sublingual immunotherapy use in preschool children, efficacy in patients unresponsive to pharmacotherapy and
safety of sublingual immunotherapy with multiple allergens [37].

 

Intranasal Steroids

Although the INS are generally regarded as the treatment of choice and the gold standard for symptoms that
are more than mild [34, 35], there is concern with unwanted systemic effects, including bone mineral loss,
growth retardation, adrenal suppression and ocular disturbances, with long-term use in children. Moreover, the
Pediatric Allergies in America survey [34] has indicated

 

Levocetirizine: A Suitable Choice in
Paediatric Allergic Diseases

hat about one third of the children who used a prescripion nasal spray (mostly INS) to treat their AR in the past
4 weeks did not achieve relief from all or most of their
symptoms and over half (51%) experienced decreased effectiveness of their medication in relieving their sympoms over the course of the day or night [34]. Furthermore, dripping down the throat, bad taste and burning
sensation, the most bothersome side effects of the prescription nasal sprays, were often sufficiently bothersome
‘0 cause the child to stop taking the medication, request
a new medication or be non-adherent with their physician’s instructions.

 

H,-Antihistamines

Symptom relief with H,-antihistamines is still the
predominant treatment choice for both AR and urticaria in children. The first-generation H)-antihistamines
have a reportedly worse tolerability and safety profile
than the newer second-generation drugs; however, surprisingly the former are widely available as OTC and as
prescription medications in developing and many developed countries for the treatment of AR and urticaria in
hildren as young as 2 years of age [38]. Furthermore,
first-generation H1-antihistamines are widely found as
active ingredients in medications for insomnia [39, 40]
as well as cough and cold [41, 42]. It is now recognised
hat the adverse effects, namely sedation, sleepiness or
drowsiness, as well as difficulties in learning and cogniive processing associated with first-generation H,-antihistamines are a consequence of their rapid absorption
and their ability to readily cross the blood-brain barrier
where they bind with high affinity to the cerebral H,receptors [38, 43]. Although first-generation Hj-antihisamines are used to ‘calm children down’ and to make
hem sleep better, there is evidence that these agents may
also lead to paradoxical central excitation, restlessness,
insomnia or seizures in some patients [38]. Indeed, studies investigating the effects of H,-antihistamines on
sleep patterns in healthy volunteers have demonstrated
that first-generation H)-antihistamines such as chlorpheniramine [44, 45] and promethazine [46] can significantly disturb sleep structure/architecture, as indicated
by increased latencies in sleep onset and rapid eye movement sleep and reduced duration of rapid eye movement
sleep and overall sleep, compared with placebo or fexofenadine, a second-generation H-antihistamine. Given
the prevalence of use of paediatric medications containing H,-antihistamines and the concerns about the potential adverse effects of these agents coupled with lack of
adequate data on the efficacy and safety of these medica
fay

tions, it is not surprising that regulators and practitioners alike have expressed a range of concerns about medications for sleep [40] as well as cough and cold [41, 47].
Indeed, the US Food and Drug Administration has recently conducted a public awareness campaign on the
safe use of non-prescription OTC cough and cold medicines in children, and issued a nationwide public health
advisory that strongly recommended against the use of
these products in children under 2 years of age because
of the risk of serious and potentially life-threatening side
effects [48]. More specifically, this campaign was aimed
at parents and caregivers to both highlight the dangers
of these medicines and make specific recommendations
on avoiding these dangers, namely that children should
not be given medicines intended for adults, that a check
should be made for the active ingredients in the medicine, that two or more medicines containing the same
active ingredients should never be given together, that
only measuring devices made and supplied for measuring the medicines should be used, and that manufacturers’ directions on how to use the medicines should be
followed carefully. A recent position paper of the Global
Allergy and Asthma European Network reinforced the
understanding of the scientific community about the
dangers of first-generation antihistamine use, drawing
attention to the fact that these medications have been
implicated in civil aviation, motor vehicle and boating
accidents, deaths as a result of accidental or intentional
overdosing in infants and young children, and suicide in
teenagers and adults [49].

Second-generation Hj-antihistamines generally do
not readily cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore
have a lower potential for side effects of the central nervous system, compared to first-generation H,-antihistamines [50]. Additionally, the majority of second-generation Hj-antihistamines bind to H)-receptors with greater
specificity and have comparatively longer half-lives, thus
respectively reducing or eliminating the potential for anticholinergic side effects and permitting use as once or
twice daily dosage. Indeed, some second-generation H)antihistamines are much more adapted for use in children due to a better therapeutic index (risk/benefit ratio)
and have been approved for treatment of AR and urticaria in very young children.

Although the H,-antihistamines are commonly used
for the treatment of both AR and chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) in children, recent reviews have indicated
that, in comparison with adults, only a limited number of
trials of these agents have been conducted primarily in
children with AR, and that data from well-designed trials

 

370 Int Arch Allergy Immunol 2011;155:367-378

in children are generally lacking [38, 43, 51]. There are
many reasons for lack of data in children. Besides the considerable and challenging ethical considerations of conducting trials in patients too young to give consent themselves [38, 43], there are often difficulties in enrolling
children into clinical trials because of the parents’ and
physicians’ concerns about the potential side effects of the
active ingredients as well as other ingredients such as sugar and excipients in medicines [43, 51]. Conversely, parental concern about the lack of symptom relief if the child
was randomised to the placebo group also plays a vital
role in parents not wishing to enrol their children in placebo-controlled studies [43]. Similarly, practical and economic difficulties, including the need to conduct multiple resource-consuming and often long-term safety and
pharmacokinetics studies in different age groups from
he neonatal period to adolescence, the requirement for
specially trained paediatric staff to conduct the trials,
variability in symptom reporting, medication adminisration, and collection of other data resulting from children spending time with multiple caregivers [38, 43], are
major factors upon which pharmaceutical companies are
incentivised or not to progress with trials in paediatric
patients. Although real-life observational studies are not
a substitute for clinical trials, they do nevertheless offer a
different perspective and means for obtaining informaion about a particular medication in the paediatric population. Despite limitations such as slightly less rigorous
assessments and the influence ofa placebo effect and other confounding factors, large-scale observational studies
explore patient, parent and physician perception and satisfaction with treatment and disease management [52],
and thus reveal real-life treatment acceptance and compliance.

Presently, only three Hj-antihistamines (cetirizine
53, 54], levocetirizine [55] and loratadine [56]) have been
investigated for long-term safety in the paediatric popuation. Both cetirizine and its follow-up compound levocetirizine have a complete and comprehensive set of safey data over an 18-month treatment period in atopic children aged 1-3 years of age. The study of loratadine
collected safety information over a period of 12 months
in a similarly aged paediatric population. Since levoceirizine is the only antihistamine launched in the 21st
century with safety data over a very long treatment period
of 18 months [55], the studies of levocetirizine are further
reviewed to evaluate the suitability of this agent as a treatment option for the management of AR and CIU in children.

Studies Investigating the Efficacy and Safety of
Levocetirizine in the Treatment of Allergic Disease
in Paediatric Patients

The efficacy and safety of levocetirizine has extensively been studied over the last few years in 6-month- to
12-year-old children suffering from AR and CIU. These
studies can be generally subdivided into studies involving cohorts of children aged <6 years and 6-12 years,
based primarily on dosing using liquid formulations or
tablets, respectively.

Studies in Children <6 Years of Age

Cranswick et al. [57] first investigated the PK and PD
profile of levocetirizine over a period of 90 days in 15 children aged 12-24 months and suffering from recurrent
cough and other allergy-related symptoms. Following a
baseline histamine cutaneous challenge test on day 1, all
children were treated with a levocetirizine dose of 0.125
mg/kg, from a 5 mg/ml oral solution, and blood samples
were collected at regular times for up to 12 h for analysis
of levocetirizine. From day 2 onwards, the children were
administered the same dose of levocetirizine, twice a day
for 90 days, and visited the laboratory for control examination at days 3-6, 30, 60 and 90. At days 3-6 and day 90
morning pre-dose blood/urine samples were collected
and a histamine cutaneous challenge test was performed
to assess the inhibition from baseline in the wheal and
flare response. The PK parameters indicated that levocetirizine was absorbed rapidly from the gastrointestinal
tract and attained mean peak plasma levels (Cay) 1h
(tmax) following administration. The elimination half-life
(ty/2) of levocetirizine was found to be about 4 h and the
volume of distribution (Vq/F) was low (0.37 I/kg, approx.
4.3 litres), indicating an overall low potential for adverse
effects. Indeed, the lack of drug-related clinical adverse
events or adverse laboratory findings confirmed that levocetirizine 0.125 mg/kg twice daily, given to 1- to 2-yearold children, over 90 days, was well tolerated. Furthermore, assessment of histamine-induced wheal and flare
responses demonstrated that levocetirizine 0.125 mg/kg
twice daily completely inhibited histamine-induced
wheals and flares (100% inhibition) at days 3-6 and by
>98% at day 90, suggesting high antihistaminic potency
of this agent in 1- to 2-year-old children at this dose.

As levocetirizine is the pharmacologically active enantiomer of racemic cetirizine, it has been possible to characterise the population pharmacokinetics of levocetirizine in atopic children aged 1-4 years [58, 59] using the
large database from the Early Treatment of the Atopic

 

Levocetirizine: A Suitable Choice in
Paediatric Allergic Diseases

Child (ETAC®) study [53, 54], the first well-controlled,
long-term prospective study to investigate the effect of an
antihistamine (cetirizine) in very young children. Retrospective analysis of data by non-linear mixed effects modelling has shown that in very young children both the oral
clearance and the volume of distribution of levocetirizine
are markedly influenced by the weight of the child and
increase linearly with increasing weight [58, 59]. Conversely, eosinophilia, allergic disease, sensitisation to allergens, use of concomitant medications (corticosteroids,
penicillins, macrolides and hydroxyzine) and occurrence
of diarrhoea or gastroenteritis did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levocetirizine. Assessment of the area under the curve for plasma levocetirizine concentrations at
steady state indicated that this was similar to that observed in adults dosed with levocetirizine 5 mg once daily [58]. Collectively, these findings suggest that in children
aged 1-4 years or weighing 8-20 kg, levocetirizine dosing
should be based on body weight and that administration
of levocetirizine 0.125 mg/kg twice daily would lead to
similar exposure to levocetirizine as in adults taking the
recommended therapeutic dose of 5 mg once daily.

Compared with other commonly employed secondgeneration antihistamines levocetirizine is characterised
by a favourable PK profile, comprising a shorter elimination half-life than that for desloratadine, ebastine, fexofenadine and loratadine [60-62], and a markedly lower
volume of distribution than that for desloratadine [61,
62]. Moreover, levocetirizine is not metabolised in the liver via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system and does not
have the potential for drug interactions with inhibitors of
he cytochrome P450 enzyme system or other drugs
which are metabolised via this system [60]. Indeed, to our
nowledge, no data exist for possible drug interactions
between levocetirizine and cytochrome P450 inhibitors/
drugs metabolised via this pathway in children.

The reliable tolerability and consistent safety profile of
evocetirizine in the paediatric population suggested by
he findings for its PK properties in children aged 1-4
years has recently been confirmed by a prospective, longerm, multi-national study (Early Prevention of Asthma
in Atopic Children; EPAAC), which reported safety of levocetirizine 0.125 mg/kg twice daily in 1- to 3-year-old
children with atopic dermatitis [55]. Overall, 510 atopic
children were randomised to receive either levocetirizine
drops 0.125 mg/kg or placebo twice daily for 18 months
in a double-blind manner. Safety was assessed using numerous parameters, including any treatment-emergent
adverse events and the days on which symptoms of asthma or urticaria were recorded by parents or guardians in

diary cards, the numbers of children discontinuing the
study due to adverse events, height and body mass measurements, assessment of psychomotor development (including developmental milestones for gross and fine motor development as well as speech and language) and laboratory tests. The authors demonstrated that there were
no significant differences between the levocetirizine- and
placebo-treated groups with regard to the incidence of
overall or serious adverse events, drug-related adverse
events or the adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation of the study medication. The most common
adverse events were related to upper respiratory tract infections, transient gastroenteritis symptoms or exacerbations of allergic disease, in both groups. Indeed, not a
single case of somnolence, irritability or anxiety was reported as a neurologic or behavioural adverse event in the
levocetirizine-treated group. Similarly, there were no significant differences between the levocetirizine- and placebo-treated children with regard to age-appropriate development in height and body mass, attainment of all
psychomotor developmental milestones or physiologic
changes in haematology and biochemistry tests over the
course of the entire 18-month treatment period. Although the similarly designed ETAC study [53, 54] has
also shown treatment with cetirizine 0.25 mg/kg twice
daily for 18 months to be safe and not significantly different from placebo with respect to any safety assessments in 1- to 3-year-old children, a comparison with the
findings for levocetirizine in the EPAAC study [55] indicates that overall neurologic/behavioural events were less
frequently reported with levocetirizine (6.3% of the children) than with cetirizine (16.3% of the children), with
large differences noted in the incidence of somnolence,
irritability/nervousness, insomnia and fatigue (table 1).
More recently, two randomised, double-blind, parallelgroup, placebo-controlled, multi-centre studies have specifically investigated the safety of treatment with levocetirizine 1.25 mg and matched placebo, once or twice daily,

 

372 Int Arch Allergy Immunol 2011;155:367-378

for 2 weeks, in 69 infants aged 6-11 months and 173 children aged 1-5 years, respectively, with AR or CIU [63]. The
two study cohorts were treated with levocetirizine or placebo using a ratio of 2:1, and safety of treatment was evaluated according to treatment-emergent adverse events,
changes in weight, vital signs, electrocardiogram parameters and haematologic and biochemical laboratory tests.
The overall incidence of adverse events was similar in both
levocetirizine- and placebo-treated groups in both studies,
with 64-70.8% of the infants and 35.1-35.6% of the 1- to
5-year-old children experiencing one or more adverse
events. Most of the adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity, with mostly gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea, teething and constipation) in the infant group. Assessment of the change from baseline in vital signs and
laboratory parameters showed no clinically relevant
changes or significant differences in any outcome measures in the levocetirizine- and placebo-treated groups in
either study cohort. Similarly, assessment of change in
electrocardiogram parameters showed no significant
changes in levocetirizine or placebo-treated groups in
both studies, and none of the patients had a prolonged corrected QT interval. These findings suggest that levocetirizine 1.25 mg/day is very well tolerated in infants as young
as 6 months of age and that 2.5 mg/day is a well-tolerated
dose for 1- to 5-year-old children with AR or CIU [63].

Apart from safety and tolerability, the efficacy of levocetirizine in treating AR and CIU in very young children
has also been demonstrated in recent studies. One open,
multi-centre, exploratory study investigated the acceptability and safety of levocetirizine 1.25 mg twice daily for
4 weeks in thirty 2- to 6-year-old children with seasonal
or perennial AR [64]. Parents/guardians scored symp‘oms severity on a 4-point scale of 0 (absent) to 3 (severe)
and noted the adverse events experienced on daily record
cards over the duration of the study. Findings indicated
hat the total four symptoms score (T4SS; for sneezing,
rhinorrhoea, nasal pruritus and ocular pruritus) was decreased from a mean baseline value of 3.08 + 2.14 to 1.98
+ 1.92 (95% CI: -1.60 to —0.60) at the end of the 4-week
reatment period. Although a decrease was also noted in
he nasal congestion score, the magnitude of the fall in
his parameter was not documented. The study further
indicated that there were no treatment-related serious adverse events or withdrawal of any child from the study
due to an adverse event, during the 4-week treatment period. These findings, however, are limited in that this was
an open-label and non-placebo-controlled study, and
thus need to be confirmed in other well-controlled trials
ina larger cohort of this patient population.

 

 

Pampura/Papadopoulos/Spiéak/Kurzawa
Another randomised, double-blind, parallel-group,
multi-national, long-term study has demonstrated that
levocetirizine 0.125 mg/kg twice daily is efficacious in the
treatment and/or prevention of urticaria in children aged
1-2 years [65]. The EPAAC study protocol was essentially
employed to investigate the effect of treatment with levocetirizine drops 0.125 mg/kg twice daily or placebo twice
daily for 18 months in 510 children with atopic dermatitis. Assignment to treatment group was made according
to preselected randomisation factors at baseline, including sensitisation to grass pollen, house dust mite allergen
and egg, maternal history of asthma, and country of residence. Over the course of the study, parents/guardians
recorded the days during which urticaria was observed
on diary cards, and these episodes were validated by investigators during 8 scheduled visits and any additional
visits as needed. The study demonstrated that baseline
characteristics were similar for both treatment groups,
with regard to demographics, severity and duration of
atopic dermatitis and sensitisation to allergens. Over the
course of 18 months’ treatment significantly fewer children treated with levocetirizine (27.5%) experienced urticaria compared with children treated with placebo
(41.6%; p < 0.001). Similarly, both the mean number of
urticaria episodes and the number of days with urticaria
were significantly lower in the levocetirizine-treated
group than in the placebo-treated group. Assessment of
these measures in the subgroups of children with and
without history of urticaria at enrolment demonstrated
that the number of children with urticaria as well as the
mean number of urticaria episodes and the mean number of days with urticaria were also significantly reduced
in the levocetirizine-treated group compared with the
placebo-treated group (fig. 1). These findings suggest that
levocetirizine is not only efficacious in treatment of urticaria, but may also be efficacious in preventing/delaying
the onset of urticaria in children with atopic dermatitis.

Studies in Children Aged 6-12 Years

The pharmacologic profile of levocetirizine has been
investigated in children aged 6-11 years [66]. Fourteen
children weighing 20-40 kg and suffering from mild AR
were each administered a single dose of levocetirizine

authors showed that mean maximum plasma levocetirizine concentrations were attained after a mean time of
1.2 h (tmax) and cleared at the mean terminal elimination
half-life of 5.7 h (ty2). A comparison of the elimination
half-lives of levocetirizine and other commonly employed H,-antihistamines suggests that levocetirizine appears to be eliminated faster than the other H,-antihistamines also in this age group [60, 61]. Moreover, as shown
in younger children aged 1-2 years [57], the mean oral
clearance rate of 0.82 ml/min/kg and the mean volume of
distribution (0.4 1/kg) were also found to be low in this
patient cohort [66] and were lower than those for desloratadine [61]. Assessment of histamine-induced wheal
and flare responses further demonstrated that levocetirizine 5 mg significantly inhibited both histamine-induced
wheals and flares from pre-dose baseline values from 1 to
28 h, with mean maximum 97% inhibition of wheals occurring from 2 to 10 h after dosing and mean maximum
93% inhibition of flares occurring from 2 to 24 h after
dosing. These results were accompanied by 3 children reporting upper respiratory events, attributed to the underlying allergic diseases, 2 children reporting gastrointestinal symptoms considered unrelated to the study medication, and 3 children reporting fatigue attributed by the
authors to the intensity of the study and considered to be
possibly related to the study drug.

Recently, Simons et al. [67] have correlated the levocetirizine-mediated inhibition of the histamine wheal and
flare response noted in these children with the peripheral
H,-receptor occupancy by levocetirizine in 6- to 11-yearold children with AR. The authors showed that the peripheral Hj-receptor occupancy of levocetirizine at 4 and 24h
after dosing were 94 and 60%, respectively, corresponding
to 95-85% flare suppression and 100-70% wheal suppression during this period. Moreover, these values at 4 and 24
h after dosing in children are similar to the values of 90
and 57% in adults, lending support for once daily levocetirizine 5 mg dosing in children aged 6-11 years [67].

The safety and efficacy of levocetirizine 5 mg once daily in the treatment of seasonal AR and perennial AR has
been investigated in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trials [68, 69]. The first study
investigated the efficacy of levocetirizine 5 mg once daily
for 6 weeks in 177 grass and/or weed pollen-sensitised children aged 6-12 years, with seasonal AR [68]. All children
scored the severity of their rhinorrhoea, sneezing, nasal
pruritus and ocular pruritus (T4SS) as well as nasal congestion on a scale of 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) in daily diary
cards. Additionally, change from baseline in health-related
quality of life was assessed using the Paediatric Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (PRQLQ), and
parents, physicians and children assessed the global evolution of disease on a scale of 0 (marked worsening) to 7

 

374 Int Arch Allergy Immunol 2011;155:367-378

(marked improvement). The study showed that levocetirizine was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the severity of mean T4SS from baseline over the
entire study period (p<0.001) and nearly twice as effective
as placebo over the first 2 weeks of treatment. Levocetirizine also significantly improved nasal congestion over the
first 5 weeks of treatment and led to overall greater improvements from baseline in individual domain and overall PRQLQ scores from week 2 onwards, compared with
placebo. Over the first 2 weeks of treatment, 80-85% of
parents/guardians, physicians and children were satisfied
with the disease improvement with levocetirizine treatment, compared with only 53-61% of parents/guardians,
physicians and children in the placebo group. Safety assessments further indicated that the two treatment groups
were not significantly different with regard to incidence of
adverse events. Headache, bronchitis and epistaxis were
he most commonly reported study adverse events, with 10
of them considered by the investigator to be treatment reated, 5 in each group. None of the adverse events were serious and only 1 placebo-treated child prematurely disconinued treatment because of safety issues.

Using a similar design, the study in children with perennial AR investigated the effect of levocetirizine 5 mg
once daily for 4 weeks on T4SS and PRQLQ scores in 306
children aged 6-12 years [69]. The investigators also recorded their global evaluation of disease evolution at the
end of treatment. The results demonstrated levocetirizine
to significantly improve the T4SS (p< 0.01) at weeks 2 and
4 of treatment as well as PRQLQ overall scores (p < 0.015)
at weeks 1 and 2 of treatment, compared with placebo
(fig. 2). Indeed, a significant correlation was noted between the improvements from baseline in T4SS and improvements in PRQLQ overall score at week 2 of treatment
(r = 0.51; p < 0.001). Analysis of the 50% responder rate
above placebo, which was considered as the level of clinical significance, indicated that the likelihood of symptom
severity being halved over the first 2 weeks was 3-fold
greater with levocetirizine than with placebo (p = 0.01).
The investigators rated 57.1% of the children in the levocetirizine group as markedly or moderately improved,
compared with 44.7% of the children in the placebo group.
Assessment of safety parameters demonstrated that levocetirizine was not significantly different from placebo
with regard to incidence or type of most common adverse
events, treatment-related adverse events, or withdrawal
from the study. Headache, upper respiratory tract infection and influenza were the most commonly reported
study adverse events, with 7.8 and 5.9% of the levocetirizine- and placebo-treated children, respectively, experi

encing events judged as related to the study medication; 2
children from the placebo group discontinued the study
due to sinobronchitis and aggravated asthma, and 2 levocetirizine-treated children discontinued due to upper respiratory tract infection and otitis media.

More recently, the international Observational Survey
in Children with AR evaluated parents’ and physicians’
satisfaction with efficacy and tolerability of any oral Hjantihistamine treatment in children with allergic diseases [70]. A total of 4,581 children aged 2-12 years were
enrolled from 424 primary care/specialist allergy clinics
across 7 countries in Europe and Asia. Of these, 66.5% of
the patients suffered from AR and 14.5% of the patients
from CIU as primary conditions. Parents and physicians
of eligible children scored questionnaires evaluating their
satisfaction with efficacy, tolerability and overall satisfaction with the H,-antihistamine used as well as the impact
of this medication on the child’s sleep and school performance and their willingness to use/recommend the same
H,-antihistamine in the future. The authors reported
that both parents and physicians were significantly more
satisfied with the use of second-generation Hj-antihistamines than with the use of first-generation H,-antihistamines. Assessment of the most commonly used secondgeneration Hj-antihistamines indicated that levocetirizine was the most frequently used, while fexofenadine
and azelastine were the least frequently used in the study

cohort. Indeed, the most common use of levocetirizine
was reflected by generally both the parents’ and physicians’ mean satisfaction scores for efficacy, tolerability
and global satisfaction for levocetirizine being highest,
and, together with fexofenadine, significantly greater
than those for the other second-generation Hj-antihistamines. Assessment of physicians’ and parents’ (fig. 3) satisfaction scores according to 2- to 6-year-old and 7- to
12-year-old age groups also indicated levocetirizine to
generally score higher for efficacy, tolerability and global
satisfaction than the other second-generation H,-antihisamines in both age groups. Although with generally lower scores, fexofenadine, desloratadine and cetirizine were
better perceived by physicians and parents than loratadine and azelastine. Similarly, the parents generally rated
levocetirizine higher than the other H,-antihistamines,
with fexofenadine scoring nearly as well as levocetirizine,
for their positive impact on their child’s quality of sleep,
ability to function at school and quality of school activiies (fig. 4). The number of parents and physicians willing
‘0 use or recommend the same antihistamine treatments
were generally high in this observational study, at 92.1
and 92.6%, respectively. Clemastine was the antihistamine with the lowest number of physicians (50%) willing
o recommend it to their patients. In terms of adverse
events, this large observational study confirmed that second-generation antihistamines were associated with few

er tolerability issues than first-generation antihistamines;
for example, 22.1% of patients treated with hydroxyzine,
24.0% treated with cyproheptadine, 27.8% treated with
clemastine and 30.0% treated with chlorpheniramine reported adverse events, compared with 1.8% of patients on
desloratadine, 2.0% on levocetirizine, 2.4% on fexofenadine, 2.5% on loratadine and 4.7% on cetirizine.

Collectively, the findings of this real-life study suggest
that parents and physicians were more satisfied with second-generation antihistamines, with levocetirizine and
fexofenadine being the most preferred among the H)-antihistamines currently employed for treatment of allergic
disease in children aged 2-12 years, with regard to efficacy, tolerability as well as the impact on their child’s
sleep and school activities [70].

Conclusion

Children appear to be more affected than ever before
and suffer from both persistent and severe symptoms.
Due to the limited number of clinical trials in children
the amended Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2007 now
requires all new drugs for children to be properly assessed
for ‘the safety and effectiveness of the drug or the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant
pediatric sub-populations’ [71]. Levocetirizine is one of

 

376 Int Arch Allergy Immunol 2011;155:367-378

the most extensively investigated antihistamines for safety and efficacy in children of different ages ranging from
6 months to 12 years. Compared with cetirizine [72], desloratadine, fexofenadine and mizolastine [73], levocetirizine seems to have a favourable PK profile with respect to
absorption, plasma protein binding or volume of distribution, suggesting a potentially greater therapeutic index
for this antihistamine. Real-life studies have indicated
good satisfaction levels with levocetirizine for the majority of patients.

In conclusion, the use of the first-generation H,-antihistamines should undoubtedly be limited or discontinued in children suffering from AR or CIU and physicians
should, whenever possible, prescribe only the new secondgeneration Hj-antihistamines to children. In view of the
data currently available for pharmacokinetics, clinical
safety/tolerability, efficacy and general preference for levocetirizine by both parents/guardians and physicians, levocetirizine seems a suitable treatment option for AR and
chronic urticaria in children aged 6 months to 12 years.
