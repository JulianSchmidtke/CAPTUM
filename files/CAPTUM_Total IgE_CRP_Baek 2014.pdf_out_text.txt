severity.

Introduction

Various scoring systems for urticaria severity exist.
The Urticaria Activity Score (UAS) primarily assesses
the key symptoms of urticaria, which are wheals and
pruritus.' A previous study validated this system by
showing that UAS was positively correlated with quality of life impairment in patients with chronic urticaria
(CU).? However, this scoring system lacks objectivity,
as it relies largely on the patient's descriptions of
symptoms. Therefore, an additional objective criterion
for evaluating disease severity is needed.

A series of studies by Asero et al.*” previously
showed that the coagulation cascade is activated in
CU. They found that tissue factor (TF) from eosinophils
in patients with CU activated the extrinsic coagulation
cascade, resulting in conversion of prothrombin to
thrombin.* Thrombin has been shown to be capable of
inducing oedema by increasing vascular permeability
and stimulating mast cell degranulation, and the
authors concluded that thrombin probably plays an
important role in the pathogenesis of CU.> Several
studies have shown an association between urticaria
severity and laboratory markers of the coagulation/
fibrinolysis pathway, including prothrombin fragment

contradictory reports about the reliability of these
potential markers. For example, in a recent study, IL6, IL-9, IL-18, IL-31, neopterin and VEGF were not
increased in CU.!°

Most previous studies have focused primarily on
assessing disease severity in patients with CU,
whereas studies involving both AU and CU have
rarely been reported in the literature. The aim of the
present study was to evaluate the ability of some of
the aforementioned laboratory markers (D-dimer,
CRP and total IgE) to predict disease severity in cases
of AU and CU.

Methods

The study was reviewed and approved by the
institutional review board of the Korea University
Guro Hospital. Patients were informed about the aims
and details of the investigation, and gave written
informed consent.

Patients

The study was conducted at the Korea University
Guro Hospital, which is an 877-bed referral hospital
in Seoul, Korea. A retrospective analysis of medical
records, laboratory test results and interview
responses from patients with urticaria who visited the
Department of Dermatology between June 2011 and
March 2013 was carried out. Only patients with
spontaneous urticaria were included; patients with
physical urticarias were excluded based on their clinical history. Patients who were taking medications
that could have influenced the coagulation/fibrinolysis
pathway such as acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel, warfarin or heparin were excluded from the study.
Patients who had a medical history of concurrent
inflammatory infection, asthma, allergic rhinitis or
atopic dermatitis were also excluded because these
can affect laboratory results.

Our department has standardized clinical investigations and treatment regimens for patients with
urticaria, which includes clinical interview, laboratory
tests and standardized antihistamine prescription.

Laboratory tests

At the initial visit, blood samples were collected from
all patients. D-dimer levels were measured using an
automated latex agglutination method (STA-R Evolution®; Diagnostica Stago, Asniéres, France), and levels

796 Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2014) 39, pp795-800

of < 0.5 «g/L were considered to be within the normal
range.

CRP levels were measured by an automated latexenhanced turbidimetric immunoasssay (TBA-200FR°L:
Toshiba Medical System, Tokyo, Japan), and levels of
<5 mg/L were considered to be within the normal
range.

Total IgE levels were measured by immunoradiometric assay (SR300°I Stratec Biomedical AG, Birkenfeld,
Germany), and levels of < 91 IU/mL were considered
to be within the normal range for adults. For children,
cut-off values for each age group were determined
according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Clinical interview

At the follow-up visit, patients were interviewed by
trained dermatologists. At that time, a detailed medical
history including current medications was obtained.
The duration and type of urticaria were also recorded.
The average UAS during the time between the initial
visit and the follow-up visit (typically, 7-10 days) was
measured. Responses to prescribed antihistamines were
recorded by the patient as none, poor to partial, or
good to complete.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS software (version 20.0 for Windows; SPSS Inc, Chicago,
IL, USA). Correlations were calculated using Spearrank correlation coefficient. Comparisons
between the group with raised D-dimer levels and the
group with normal D-dimer levels were made using
Mann-Whitney U-test or x? tests. P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results

Demographic characteristics of patients

The medical records and laboratory results of 116
patients were initially analyzed in this study, and of
these, 17 patients with physical urticaria (2 of whom
also had atopic dermatitis) were excluded, as were 5
other patients because of the medications they were
taking. This left 94 patients, who were included in the
study. The patients had a mean age of 39.0 years and
a female predominance. Only 13 patients with spontaneous urticaria reported also having angio-oedema
(Table 1).

Comparisons between the raised D-dimer group and
the normal D-dimer group

There were 39 patients (41.8%) with a raised D-dimer
level, and 55 (58.5%) with a D-dimer level within
normal limits. The raised D-dimer group had significantly higher UAS than the normal D-dimer group.
Additional analysis showed no significant difference
between the two groups in the response to antihistamine (Table 2).

Discussion

The EAACI/GA?LEN/EDE/WAO guideline recommends
the UAS for evaluation of disease activity in patients
with urticaria.! Although this scoring system is easy
and convenient, it depends primarily on subjective
descriptions given by patients. Therefore, it lacks a
quantitative component, and may not be entirely
accurate.!° Several studies have been conducted to
identify additional objective biomarkers of disease

severity in cases of urticaria. However, most of these
studies, with the exception of one study by KasperskaZajac and Brzoza,*° included only patients with CU.

The most widely studied biomarkers for measuring
urticaria severity belong to the coagulation/fibrinolysis
pathway. Use of these biomarkers was originally
suggested by Asero et al.* who reported as indirect evidence that the proportion of skin test-positive patients
substantially increases if an autologous plasma skin
test (APST) is performed instead of an autologous
serum skin test (ASST). They also showed that Fy42
levels,” which reflect thrombin generation, are significantly raised in patients with CU compared with
healthy control subjects. Furthermore, some patients
with urticaria experience symptom relief with anticoagulants such as heparin*” or warfarin,?! or with antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid.* These results
directly support the involvement of the coagulation/
fibrinolysis cascade in the pathogenesis of urticaria.
Several studies have proposed additional components
of this pathway, such as D-dimer level,*7?1°!7
Fy4.°? FDP!°!7 and soluble fibrin monomer complex’ as potential markers for urticaria severity.

As previously described, TF from eosinophils in
patients with CU activates the extrinsic coagulation
cascade, resulting in conversion of prothrombin to
thrombin.* When this conversion takes place, F,42 is
released into the circulation. Thrombin subsequently
converts fibrinogens to fibrin monomers, which are
covalently linked as fibrin polymers by factor XIIla.
Finally, fibrin is degraded by plasmin, which creates
EDP and exposes the D-dimer antigen.!°?* Therefore,
the D-dimer level reflects formation (coagulation pathway) and digestion (fibrinolysis) of fibrin.!° The present study showed that a substantial percentage of

© 2014 British Association of Dermatologists
patients with urticaria had raised D-dimer levels, and
that these correlated significantly with disease severity.
As expected, patients with raised D-dimer levels had a
higher UAS than patients with normal D-dimer levels.
These results suggest that D-dimer level can be used
as a reliable marker of disease severity for both AU
and CU. Additionally, these results suggest that the
coagulation/fibrinolysis pathway might be activated in
a subset of patients with urticaria. However, whether
the elevation of D-dimer level contributes to the
pathogenesis of urticaria or is an epiphenomenon
remains to be determined. It is important to note that
low D-dimer level can also be found in patients with
high UAS. This suggests that activation of the
coagulation/fibrinolysis pathway is not always present
in the pathogenesis of urticaria, and raises the
possibility of different pathogenesis among patients.

Interestingly, response to antihistamine did not
differ significantly between the raised and normal
D-dimer groups. Therefore, urticaria with a raised
D-dimer level does not necessary require treatment
with an anticoagulant or antifibinolytics, as most
cases will respond to a traditional antihistamine.
However, this finding was not consistent with the
findings of a recent study that suggested D-dimer as a
biomarker for antihistamine-resistant CU.?? Further
studies are required to clarify the relationship between
D-dimer and antihistamine response.

It is important to recognize that a raised D-dimer
level in patients with urticaria is not due to an
ongoing intravascular coagulopathy such as active
thromboembolism. Fujii et al.2* previously reported
that activation of the coagulation/fibrinolysis cascade
occurs extravascularly, primarily in the dermis. They
also found that thrombin generated in patients with
urticaria is instantly inactivated by tissue antithrombin III, and that fibrinogen degradation products flow
backwards into the systemic circulation through the
hyperpermeable vasculature.

CRP is known to be a very sensitive marker for
AU-phase responses associated with conditions such as
infection, inflammatory disease, malignancy and
trauma.*? Previous studies have shown that CRP
levels are raised in certain patients with CU, and that
CRP levels correlate with disease activity.!°-1* Additionally, previous studies reported that CRP levels correlated significantly with levels of IL-6.!7 Some
investigators have suggested that IL-6 elevation is
characteristic of the active phase of CU, and that
increased CRP levels are caused by IL-6.'°-?> The present study failed to show a significant correlation
between CRP level and urticaria severity. Therefore,

D-dimer level and severity of urticaria e Y. S. Baek et al.

CRP cannot as yet be considered a definite marker for
urticaria severity, and further studies are needed to
determine the true relationship between urticaria
severity and CRP level.

Kessel et al.!? previously showed a significant association between increased total IgE and CU severity.
They hypothesized that this relationship may be
explained by the effects of IgE on mast cell activation
and degranulation. In our study, a substantial percentage of patients had increased levels of total IgE. However, there was no significant relationship between
total IgE level and urticaria severity. This may be due
to differences in urticaria severity scoring methods or
statistical analysis.

The study had several limitations. Firstly, it was a
retrospective study with a limited number of patients
at a single referral hospital. In addition, it did not
assess laboratory markers repeatedly, and did not
include other laboratory markers such as F,42 and
FDP. Further prospective studies in larger populations
conducted at multiple centre are required to expand
further on our findings.

Conclusion

D-dimer level can be used as a marker of disease severity for both acute and chronic urticaria. However,
CRP and total IgE are not as reliable in predicting disease severity.

 

What's already known about this topic?

* Several laboratory markers, including D-dimer,
CRP and total IgE, have been used as possible
markers of severity in CU.

 

 

What does this study add?

+ D-dimer level can be used as a marker of disease severity for both AU and CU.

* CRP and total IgE are not reliable markers in
predicting disease severity for either AU or CU.
