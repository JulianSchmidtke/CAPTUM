safety of the high-affinity, anti-IgE therapy

MEDI4212 in non-Japanese and Japanese
subjects with atopy and/or diagnostic
IgE >30 IU/mL.

Methods: Subjects with atopy and/or baseline
IgE >301U/mL were randomized to a single
dose of subcutaneous (5, 15, 60, 150, or
300 mg) or intravenous (300mg) MEDI4212,
subcutaneous omalizumab, or placebo.
Following administration, pharmacokinetic,
pharmacodynamic [IgE (free and total), and
FceRI expression], and
assessments were made.

Results: MEDI4212 rapidly suppressed free
serum IgE to a_ greater

cellular safety

extent than
omalizumab; however, recovery of free IgE to
baseline in MEDI4212-dosed subjects was rapid
when compared with the slow and gradual
recovery seen in omalizumab-dosed
individuals. The loss of IgE suppression
corresponded with a rapid decrease of serum
MEDI4212. FceRI expression on dendritic cells
and basophils was reduced following MEDI4212
dosing. MEDI4212 was well tolerated by
subjects; adverse events were generally of low
severity and no subjects discontinued due to
adverse events.

Conclusions: The increased potency of
MEDI4212 may be of clinical interest for
individuals with high-diagnostic IgE levels
where more extensive IgE suppression is
required for clinical response. However, the
modest duration of free IgE suppression below
the target concentration noted with MEDI4212
in this study suggests limited potential for
dosing schedule advantages over omalizumab.

INTRODUCTION

Atopy is a hypersensitivity syndrome defined as
a propensity to rapidly generate
immunoglobulin (Ig) E antibodies following
exposure to minimal quantities of common
allergens such as pollen, dust mites and certain
foods [1]. Atopy presents clinically as allergic
diseases such as allergic asthma, allergic
rhino-conjunctivitis, and atopic dermatitis [2].
Allergic diseases are among the most common
health issues worldwide [3] and can markedly
interfere with a patient’s quality of life [4].

The role of IgE antibodies in allergic disease
is well documented and clinically validated [5,
6]. IgE released from B lymphocytes binds to
and cross-links high-affinity IgE receptors,
FceRI, on the surface of mast cells and
basophils, triggering cellular activation and
degranulation that drives inflammatory
responses [5]. Increased serum IgE levels can
provide a positive feedback loop of enhanced
allergic sensitization [7]. T-helper type 2 cells
can be stimulated by mast cells and basophils

4 Adis

that have undergone cellular activation in
response to IgE [5]. Additionally, effector
functions in monocytes and eosinophils can
also be induced by IgE [8, 9], and IgE-mediated
cross-linking of FceRI on plasmacytoid dendritic
cells (pDC) can induce interleukin-10 secretion
and inhibit interferon-« production [10, 11].
Anti-IgE therapy inhibits binding of IgE to its
receptors [6], and can downregulate FceRIla on
human basophils [12, 13], mast cells [14], and
dendritic cells [15]. Omalizumab is a humanized
monoclonal antibody (mAb) against IgE which
has been shown to reduce asthma exacerbation
rates, emergency visit rates, and asthma
symptoms compared with placebo in patients
with moderate to severe allergic asthma [16, 17].
Omalizumab is currently licensed for the
reatment of moderate to severe and severe
asthma [18], however, the use of omalizumab is
restricted by upper limits in baseline IgE
<7001U/mL (USA); <1500IU/mL (EU)], and
patient weight [<60 kg for IgE >600-700 IU/mL
(USA); <50 kg for IgE 1300-1500 IU/mL (EU)]
18]. Additionally, while omalizumab is also
effective at treating chronic idiopathic urticaria
19], its efficacy and clinical benefit in other

 

allergic conditions is not yet proven [2, 6]. There
exists a need for optimized anti-IgE treatments,
with greater potency for IgE suppression and less
frequent dosing regimens than omalizumab,
which can also be used in patients with higher
baseline IgE levels and greater body weight.
Pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD)
modeling data has demonstrated that anti-IgE
mAbs with increased affinity may be beneficial
for the treatment of patients whose IgE levels or
body weight falls outside the dosing
requirements for omalizumab [20]. As such,
novel anti-IgE therapies with higher affinities
for IgE are being widely studied to fulfill these
needs [21, 22].
Adv Ther (2016) 33:225-251

MEDI4212 is a human mAb which targets
the IgE pathway with high-affinity by
selectively binding IgE and_ blocking its
binding to FceRI and FceRII/CD23 (low-affinity
IgE receptor) [23]. Pre-clinical ex vivo analysis
demonstrated that MEDI4212 binds human IgE
with an affinity of 1.95 pM (>100-fold greater
than the affinity of omalizumab) and is more
potent than omalizumab at preventing IgE
binding to FceRI and suppressing endogenous
IgE levels in human sera [23].

The objectives of this first-in-human study
were to assess the safety, tolerability,
and PD of single
ascending subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous
(IV) doses of MEDI4212 in adult subjects with
atopy and/or baseline IgE >30 IU/mL. The focus
of the PK and PD assessments were to evaluate
the effects of single SC and IV doses of
MEDI4212 and omalizumab on serum IgE

immunogenicity, PK,

concentrations (free and total) and on FceRI
receptor expression on basophils and dendritic
cells, and how the effects of single doses of
MEDI4212 compared with that of single doses
of omalizumab.

METHODS

This was a phase I, randomized, placebo/
omalizumab-controlled, first-in-human
dose-escalation study (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier, NCT01544348) conducted at seven
sites in the USA between January 24, 2012 and

June 12, 2013.
Subjects

Eligible subjects were non-Japanese or Japanese
men or women aged 18-60 years who were of
non-childbearing potential with a current
diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma,

227

or atopic dermatitis, and/or diagnostic IgE
concentrations >30IU/mL (some
subjects were deemed healthy).

Japanese
Inclusion
criteria included a body weight of 45-150 kg
(45-90 kg for omalizumab administration) and
a forced expiration volume in 1s (FEV)
of >80% of predicted value; study participants
who did not have a diagnosis of asthma with
FEV, <80% predicted were included if deemed
free of lung Non-prohibited
medications for the management of identified

disease.

comorbidities were permitted. Japanese subjects
with serum IgE >30 IU/mL were included in the
study to broaden the understanding of the
effects of a single dose of MEDI4212 on safety,
PK, and PD in Japanese subjects. Japanese
subjects were born in Japan, had a valid
Japanese passport, had not lived outside Japan
for more than 5 years at the time of screening,
and had parents (and both sets of grandparents)
who were Japanese.

Exclusion criteria included: exposure to an
anti-IgE mAb within 12months prior to
screening, hyper IgE syndrome, prior history of
immune complex disease/type 3 hypersensitivity
reactions, or prior infusion reaction to mAb
administration. Prohibited medications included
oral corticosteroids, medium-high-dose inhaled
corticosteroids/long-acting beta2-agonists as
defined in the Global Initiative for Asthma
guidelines [24], immunosuppressives, and beta
blockers. Subjects must not have received allergy
immunotherapy within 7 days of investigational
product administration.

All procedures followed were in accordance
with the ethical standards of the responsible
committee on human _— experimentation
(institutional and national) and with the
Helsinki Declaration of 1964, as revised in
2013. Informed consent was obtained from all
patients for being included in the study.

Study Design

Subjects were screened within 28 days prior to
dosing, and subjects were admitted to the study
site 1 day prior to dosing (inpatient period; day
0). Subjects were randomized to dose cohorts on
day O using interactive web/voice-response
systems. Subjects were pooled according to
their screening diagnostic IgE concentrations
as follows: Group) A,  30-7001U/mL
(low-diagnostic IgE); Group B, >700-1200 IU/
mL (high-diagnostic IgE); Group C,
IgE >1200 IU/mL (high-diagnostic IgE); Group
D, 30-500 IU/mL (low-diagnostic IgE); Group
E, >700 IU/mL (high-diagnostic IgE); and Group
F, >30 IU/mL (low-diagnostic IgE). Body weight
of subjects were 45-150 kg (Groups A, B, and C),
45-90 kg (Group D), and 45-150 kg (Groups E
and F). Non-Japanese subjects from Groups A-E
were randomized to cohorts 1-6 to receive a
single dose of MEDI4212 (Fig. 1), omalizumab
(Group D), or placebo (Fig. 1). Japanese subjects
from Group F were randomized to cohorts 7-9
to receive a single dose of MEDI4212 or placebo
(Fig. 1). The numbers of subjects from Groups
A-F who were randomized into each cohort are
displayed in Fig. 1. Within cohorts 1-6, subjects
were stratified by screening diagnostic IgE
concentrations as follows: low-diagnostic IgE,
30-700 IU/mL; high-diagnostic IgE, >700 IU/
mL or >1200 IU/mL (Fig. 1). Subjects who were
randomized to cohort 4a to receive MEDI4212
150 mg SC or omalizumab 150 or 300 mg SC
had a diagnostic IgE of 30-500 IU/mL (classified
as low-diagnostic IgE). Japanese subjects in
cohorts 7-9 had diagnostic IgE >30 IU/mL.
Investigational product was administered on
day 1. Within each dosing cohort, MEDI4212 was
administered to the second subject 24 h after the
first. After a further 24h, the remaining subjects
within the cohort were administered MEDI4212.

Dose escalation to a new cohort was only initiated
after at least 75% of subjects in the previous
cohort had completed 7 days of follow-up without
the occurrence of any significant safety events. For
the two lowest dose cohorts a minimum of four
subjects was required for dose escalation, and for
the subsequent cohorts a minimum of seven
subjects was required for dose escalation. If no
safety concerns were identified, subjects were
discharged on day 3 after completion of study
procedures and were followed-up for 12 weeks
after dosing.

Assessments

Assessments were made on days 0, 1 (pre-dose
and post-dose), 2, 3, 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, 43, 57, and
85. Assays used for PK, PD, and immunogenicity
assessments were internally validated by
MedImmune. For data analysis of PK/PD
assessments, days-after-dosing was used rather
than study day (ie., “study day 1” equals
“O days after dosing”).

Pharmacokinetics Assessments

For SC MEDI4212, blood samples for PK
assessment were taken on day 1 (pre-dose) and
on all subsequent study visits; for ['V MEDI4212
(cohort 6), blood samples were taken pre-dose,

 

2h+ 15 min post-dose, and on all subsequent
study visits.

To measure MEDI4212, diluted serum
samples, standard curve calibrators and quality
control (QC) samples were

microtiter plate wells coated with a mouse

incubated in

monoclonal MEDI4212 anti-idiotype antibody
(clone IgE-023). After incubation and washing,

timepoints at terminal elimination phase were
excluded from the ty, calculation, as AUCo_ins,
CL, CL/F, and V,, V,/F could not be determined
through WinNonlin when the t, was not
available.

Immunogenicity

Immunogenicity was assessed on days 1
(pre-dose), 15, 43, and 85 using a validated
ECL assay to detect anti-MEDI4212 antibodies
in serum samples. A tiered approach to detected
anti-drug antibody (ADA) screening/
confirmation/titration assay was employed.
This assay was a homogeneous double
bridging assay. All samples including positive
control and the negative control were diluted in
buffer containing FceR1-Fc receptor and
pre-incubated for approximately lh. A
polyclonal antibody to MEDI4212 served as
the positive control. The screening assay
method utilized biotinylated and
ruthenium-labeled MEDI4212 as the capture
and detection reagents, respectively.
Pre-incubated samples including positive and
negative controls, biotinylated MEDI4212, and
ruthenium-conjugated MEDI4212 were mixed
and incubated at room temperature for
approximately 2h. Antibody to IgE (clone
#7E6.1, MedImmune) was also added to the
mixture to block non-specific signals. The
mixture was subsequently incubated on a

(Meso Scale Discovery). In the confirmatory
assay, screening-positive samples were tested
with and without MEDI4212 for specificity.

Pharmacodynamics Assessments
The sampling frequency for free and total IgE
was identical to PK assessments. Minimal

detected by addition of ruthenium-labeled
mouse anti-IgE antibody clone 2C7.3
(detection reagent, 2C7.3-TAG, MedImmune)
for approximately 1h at room temperature.
After washing, MSD Read Buffer T was added to
the plate and the ECL signal for each plate well
was measured by an MSD Sector Imager. The
minimal required dilution was 1:9, and the
lower limit of quantitation was 5.553 pg/mL in
100% human serum.

Surface expression of FceRIa on basophils
and dendritic cells was measured in
non-Japanese subjects from blood samples
taken at screening and days 1 (pre-dose), 8, 29,
and 85. FceRIa surface expression was analyzed
in an identified subset of MEDI4212 subjects
who achieved and maintained full IgE
suppression (<1 IU/mL) from start of therapy
through day 29 (28 days after dosing). Sample

Demographics and_ baseline clinical
characteristics for non-Japanese and Japanese
subjects are given in Table 1. Japanese subjects
had a median [minimum
(min)—maximum(max)] body weight (68.8
[58.0-96.2] kg vs 79.4 [55.3-117.9] kg) and a

lower median (min-max) age (29.0 [21-57]

lower

years vs 43.5 [20-59] years) than non-Japanese
subjects. Non-Japanese subjects were
predominantly white (45/60, 75%) and male
(40/60, 66.7%); Japanese subjects were mostly
male (91.7%). Median (min-max) baseline FEV,
percent predicted in cohorts 1-6 and 7-9 were
86.5 (67.0-116.0)% and 99.5 (82.0-117.0)%,
respectively. Five Japanese subjects had no
significant findings in their medical history
relating to atopic or allergic disease.

Pharmacokinetics

Individual serum concentrations following a
single dose of MEDI4212 or omalizumab are
presented in Fig. 2; mean serum concentrations
over time are presented in Fig.S1 in the
supplementary material. PK parameters are
summarized in Table 2.

Non-Japanese subjects with low-diagnostic
IgE (30-700 IU/mL) tended to have a longer ty,
and lower CL/F than those with high-diagnostic
IgE (>700 IU/mL; Table 2a, b). Generally, t,, and
CL/F increased with increasing dose. Median
AUCo-_ing tended to increase with increasing
dose, and median values tended to be greater
in low-diagnostic IgE subjects compared with
high-diagnostic IgE subjects at the same dose.
The estimated bioavailability for 300mg SC
MEDI4212 was 32.9% and 15.9% for subjects
with low-diagnostic IgE and high-diagnostic
IgE, respectively.

For Japanese subjects, the CL/F appeared to
be lower and exposures (AUCp_ins) appeared to
be greater compared with non-Japanese subjects

Fig. 2 Individual serum concentrations following a single
dose of MEDI4212. Individual serum concentrations in
non-Japanese and Japanese subjects following a single dose
of MEDI4212 (5 mg SC, 15 mg SC, 150 mg SC, 300 mg
SC, or 300 mg IV) or omalizumab. Japanese subjects
(diagnostic IgE concentration >30 IU/mL) received 60 mg

with low-diagnostic IgE at the same dose
(Table 2a, c).

Pharmacodynamics

Free and Total IgE Concentrations

A rapid suppression in free IgE was observed in
most MEDI4212-treated subjects (Fig. 3; Fig. S2
in the supplementary material). In
non-Japanese subjects with low-diagnostic IgE,
MEDI4212 doses >60 mg suppressed free IgE
below the lower limit of quantification
(LLOQ; <1.172 ng/mL). MEDI4212 suppressed
free IgE below the LLOQ at doses of 300 mg in
subjects with high-diagnostic IgE levels
(>700 IU/mL). In the high-diagnostic IgE
group, 150 mg SC MEDI4212 did not suppress
free IgE as judged by the group mean (Fig. S2);
however, free IgE was suppressed to the LLOQ
in three of five subjects and to 1.284 ng/mL in
one individual. Only one individual displayed

SC, 150 mg SC, or 300 mg SC MEDI4212. The LLOQ for
MEDI4212 (83.34ng/mL) and omalizumab (205.76 ng/
mL) are shown as a dotted line and measurements below the
LLOQ are plotted at half of the LLOQ. JV intravenous,
LLOQ lower limit of quantitation, SC subcutaneous

insignificant suppression of free IgE; this subject
had diagnostic IgE > 4000 IU/mL (MedImmune,
data on file). MEDI4212 doses of 60mg
suppressed free IgE below the LLOQ in
subjects with diagnostic IgE of 700-1200 IU/
mL. Omalizumab (150mg or 300mg SC)
suppressed free IgE to a minimum of 5.23 ng/
mL (Fig.3; Fig. S2). In Japanese subjects,
MEDI4212 doses >150 mg rapidly suppressed
free IgE below the LLOQ.

The duration of free IgE suppression below
24ng/mL (101U/mL) was dependent upon
MEDI4212 dose and diagnostic IgE levels; a
longer duration of free IgE suppression appeared
to be associated with the high-dose/
low-diagnostic IgE groups (Table 2).
Low-diagnostic IgE subjects who were dosed
with 300 mg IV MEDI4212 showed a median
(min-max) duration of suppression of 56.0
(42.0-56.0) days. (min-max)
duration of suppression in omalizumab-treated

Safety and Tolerability

The primary objective of this study was to
evaluate the safety and tolerability of SC and
IV MEDI4212. In this study, a total of 39
subjects reported >1 treatment-emergent AE
(TEAE). The percentages of subjects
reporting >1 TEAE were similar in the placebo
(8/17, 47.1%) and MEDI4212 groups (29/61,
47.5%). In the omalizumab group, 2/6 (33.3%)
subjects reported >1 TEAE. Collectively, the
percentage of subjects in MEDI4212-dosed
groups who had>1 TEAE was greater in

non-Japanese subjects (25/43, 58.1%) than
Adv Ther (2016) 33:225-251

Japanese subjects (4/18, 22.2%). TEAEs reported
by >2% of non-Japanese and Japanese subjects
in any treatment group are given in Table 3. The
reported TEAEs (>10%

non-Japanese — subjects

incidence) from
(cohorts 1-6) were upper respiratory tract
infection and urticaria in MEDI4212-treated
subjects and upper respiratory tract infection
in placebo-treated subjects. The
incidence of reported TEAEs was low in

Japanese subjects; the frequently

overall

most
reported TEAEs in Japanese subjects were back
pain (MEDI4212-treated subjects) and upper
respiratory tract infection (placebo-treated
subjects).

Across all subjects (cohorts 1-9), the majority
of TEAEs were Grade 1 in severity. There were
no deaths, Grade 4 (life-threatening) or
treatment-emergent SAEs, and no
discontinuations from the study as a result of
an AE. Two non-Japanese subjects (placebo and
300 mg IV MEDI4212) reported TEAEs of Grade 3
severity (upper respiratory tract infection and
asthma, respectively). Of those treated with
omalizumab, two subjects (33.3%) reported one
Grade 1 TEAE each (rash
compression). A total of six subjects, all from
the non-Japanese group, reported a total of 11
TEAEs that were considered to be related to
MEDI4212: injection-site pain, injection-site

and nerve

paresthesia, myalgia, dizziness, bronchospasm,
dyspnea, pruritic rash, urticaria (reported by
three subjects), and _ flushing. Of the
MEDI4212-related TEAEs, three reported
incidences of urticaria (two 150 mg SC subjects
and one 300 mg IV subject) and one incidence of
bronchospasm (300mg IV) were of Grade 2
severity. During the study, there were no
clinically relevant changes in _ laboratory
parameters, vital signs, electrocardiogram, or

spirometry measurements.

Immunogenicity

Across cohorts 1-9, a total of 78 subjects
(placebo and MEDI4212-treated) were tested
for the presence of ADAs against MEDI4212.
Only one sample tested positive for ADA; this
sample was collected on day 1 before
administration of MEDI4212 from a subject
from __ the 150, mg SC  MEDI4212
high-diagnostic IgE group. This subject was
not excluded from PK/PD analyses as all
samples collected post-dose from the subject
tested negative for ADAs.

DISCUSSION
This randomized, double-blind, placebo/
omalizumab-controlled, phase I _ study

investigated the PK, PD, and safety data of
single ascending doses of the high-affinity
anti-IgE mAb, MEDI4212, in adult subjects
with and without atopy who had diagnostic
IgE concentrations >30 IU/mL.

Following administration of MEDI4212,
concentrations of free serum IgE were rapidly
reduced below detectable concentrations
(LLOQ, 1.172 ng/mL; 0.488 IU/mL)
demonstrating that MEDI4212 potently and
effectively suppresses free serum IgE. Increased
concentrations of total IgE were observed
suggesting that MEDI4212:IgE complexes were
cleared more slowly than free IgE alone,
consistent with results seen previously for
omalizumab [22, 25, 26].

The suppression of free serum IgE by
MEDI4212 was greater than that observed for
omalizumab; MEDI4212 doses >60 mg SC (in
subjects with low-diagnostic IgE) or 300 mg SC
(subjects with high-diagnostic IgE) suppressed
free IgE below the LLOQ, whereas omalizumab
(in our study) at doses of 150 or 300 mg SC

suppressed free IgE to a minimum
concentration of 5.23ng/mL. The 106-fold
greater affinity of MEDI4212 for IgE compared
with omalizumab [27] very likely translated into
a greater suppression of free IgE by MEDI4212
which is in
published
high-affinity anti-IgE mAbs _ were
effective than omalizumab at reducing free
serum IgE [21, 22].

As in previous studies [21, 22], we observed

agreement with previously
results demonstrating that
more

that the duration of free IgE suppression by
MEDI4212 appeared to be shorter in individuals
with high baseline IgE levels. A similar duration
of free IgE suppression was observed in
omalizumab-treated subjects (150 or 300 mg
SC) and subjects receiving 150mg SC
MEDI4212. The median baseline diagnostic IgE
level in MEDI4212-treated subjects tended to be
greater than that of omalizumab-treated
subjects. It appeared that the duration of free
IgE suppression was similar for omalizumab and
MEDI4212; however, the recovery of free IgE to
baseline was faster in subjects receiving
MEDI4212. than in those receiving
PK/PD modeling — of
omalizumab has demonstrated that there is a

omalizumab. As

relationship between free IgE suppression and
clinical outcomes [28], these results indicate
that although MEDI4212 is a potent suppressor
of free IgE, the dosing frequency is likely to be
similar to omalizumab as a result of the
duration of suppression by MEDI4212 being
comparable to that of omalizumab. The
measured free IgE suppression of MEDI4212 in
this study appears similar to QGEO31 [22];
however, as MEDI4212 has a higher affinity
than QGE031 (1.95 vs 139 pM, respectively),
MEDI4212 might be a more complete IgE
inhibitor. To accurately evaluate the affinity
difference, it would be necessary to determine

247

the affinity of MEDI4212 and QGE031 with
identical methodology.

The recovery of free IgE levels in
MEDI4212-treated subjects was associated with
a rapid decrease of free MEDI4212, and PK
analysis demonstrated that MEDI4212
exhibited target-mediated drug disposition
with fast elimination at all tested doses up to
300 mg IV. Median ty, values for MEDI4212 of
1.80-3.67 days (high-diagnostic IgE group) or
3.98-7.93 days (low-diagnostic IgE group) were
15.8 days for
omalizumab. Shorter f,, values were observed
in subjects who received the lowest SC doses of
MEDI4212 and/or subjects who had highest
diagnostic IgE,

shorter compared’ with

consistent with previously
reported results [22]. The linear clearance of
free MEDI4212 was 0.345 L/day, greater than
the reported clearance of free omalizumab [26,
29], and the estimated SC bioavailability for
MEDI4212 was much lower than that of
omalizumab. The lower bioavailability and
faster clearance of MEDI4212 in subjects with
higher diagnostic IgE levels could result from
the greater binding affinity of MEDI4212 for IgE
driving the formation of higher order
complexes, or the formation of MEDI4212:IgE
complexes in extravascular compartments.

The duration of IgE suppression and
MEDI4212 exposure were greater in Japanese
subjects than in non-Japanese subjects. The
small number of subjects, and lower baseline
IgE levels and lower body weight of Japanese
subjects may be contributing factors to the
longer ty, smaller volume of distribution, and
slower clearance observed in Japanese subjects
compared with non-Japanese subjects.

Several studies have demonstrated that there
is a relationship between diagnostic IgE and
FceRI expression; high IgE correlates with high
expression of FceRI [15, 30]. In this study we

4 Adis
248

have also demonstrated that surface expression
levels of FceRIo. on MDC1s, pDCs, and basophils
at baseline were strongly correlated with
diagnostic IgE levels. Previous studies have
demonstrated that suppression of free serum
IgE is followed by a dose- and time-dependent
suppression of FceRI on the surface of basophils
[22]. As with omalizumab [12, 14], surface
expression of FceRI was downregulated on
mDCs, pDCs, and basophils in
MEDI4212-treated subjects, and appeared to
correlate with the reduction in free serum IgE.
QGE031 most likely also reduces FceRI on mDCs

and pDCs, although only reduction on
basophils was reported [22]. Following
MEDI4212 administration the — greatest

percentage decreases in FceRI expression from
baseline were observed in subjects who had
high expression of FceRI« or high-diagnostic IgE
at baseline. This is consistent with the
recognized concept that FceRIa expression is
regulated largely by IgE levels [13, 15, 31]. The
degree of downregulation appeared similar in
subjects dosed with omalizumab and
MEDI4212, similar to results observed with the
high-affinity IgE QGEO31 [22]. As surface FceRI
expression is regulated by binding to IgE [32],
and omalizumab is able to suppress more than
90% baseline IgE, it is possible that the greater
IgE suppression by MEDI4212 may not have
translated into a measurable difference in FceRI
down-regulation. Furthermore, low levels of
FceRI receptor expression on the cell-surface
may be maintained in a manner that is
independent of the levels of free IgE [22].
Results from this study have also
demonstrated that the expression levels of the
remaining FceRIla at day 29 (28days after
MEDI4212 dosing) were not correlated with
baseline IgE concentration, suggesting that
FceRIa surface expression in the near-complete

4 Adis

Adv Ther (2016) 33:225-251

suppression of IgE was similar in most
individuals and independent from IgE levels
before dosing with MEDI4212. This indicates
that the upregulation of FceRIa as a result of
long-term high IgE levels is fully reversible with
anti-IgE therapy.

In this study, reported AEs were of low
severity (mostly Grade 1) and no post-dose
ADAs were detected. The most frequently
reported TEAE in non-Japanese subjects was
upper respiratory tract infection, which is not
an uncommon TEAE following administration
of an anti-IgE [22, 33]. The most frequently
reported TEAE in Japanese subjects, back pain,
has also been observed in previous clinical trials
of a high-affinity anti-IgE [22]. Thus, MEDI4212
demonstrated an acceptable safety profile that is
comparable to similar anti-[gE mAbs.

Limitations of this study were that it was a
single-dose study, and subjects were healthy or
had mild disease. In addition, the small
numbers of subjects in each dose group
precluded statistical comparisons between dose
groups. Moreover, only a limited number of
subjects (n = 10) with near-complete
suppression of IgE until day 29 (28 days after
dosing) were identified for the FceRI subset
analysis. Future studies with high-affinity IgE
therapies might reveal a statistically significant
difference.

CONCLUSIONS

This study demonstrated that the high-affinity
anti-IgE mAb MEDI4212 rapidly reduced free
serum IgE to a greater extent than omalizumab
in subjects with diagnostic IgE >30 IU/mL.
FceRI expression on the surface of dendritic
cells and basophils was also downregulated
following administration of MEDI4212, and
was comparable to downregulation observed
Adv Ther (2016) 33:225-251

in omalizumab-treated subjects. PK analysis
demonstrated that MEDI4212 was cleared
rapidly, coinciding with a rapid recovery of
free IgE to baseline levels. As such, MEDI4212
would not provide appreciable benefit over the
currently available therapy in terms of dosing
intervals, as frequent dosing of MEDI4212
would be required to maintain suppression of
free IgE. The increased potency of MEDI4212 at
suppressing free IgE compared with
omalizumab may be of clinical interest in
individuals for whom _  near-complete IgE
suppression is required for clinical response
(e.g., individuals with high-allergen specific
IgE).
