Background: Previous data have shown the high efficacy of omalizumab in chronic spontaneous urticaria
(CSU). However, factors that may be effective on the response to therapy, relapse rates after drug
discontinuation, and efficacy of retreatment remain unclear. This study aimed to determine the efficacy
of omalizumab in CSU refractory to conventional therapy, to identify possible factors affecting treatment
response and relapse, and also to evaluate the efficacy of retreatment on relapsed disease.

Methods: The data of CSU patients treated with 300 mg/month omalizumab for at least 3 months were
retrospectively analyzed. In order to evaluate the efficacy of treatment and retreatment, baseline and

 

Abe gE ERED follow-up concomitant medication score (CMS) and urticaria activity score (UAS) were calculated.
Management Possible factors affecting treatment response and relapse were identified.

Omalizumab Results: Twenty-five patients were included. The median duration of omalizumab therapy was 6 (6—12)
Retreatment months. Of the patients with baseline UAS 6 (5.5—6) and CMS 13 (10—15), 8 (32%) had complete response
Urticaria (UAS = 0) and 2 (8%) were non-responders after 3 months of therapy. None of the complete responders

were positive for IgG-anti-TPO. After discontinuation of omalizumab therapy, 11 (61%) patients experi
enced relapse and 10 of them received retreatment with omalizumab. Half of the patients had complete

response, and half had partial response (UAS = 1—4) after retreatment. No treatment related adverse

events were documented.

Conclusions: Omalizumab has high efficacy in both the treatment and retreatment of CSU; however,

relapse rates after discontinuation are high. Autoimmune markers may be helpful in predicting treat
ment response and relapse.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (formerly called chronic idiopathic urticaria) (CSU) is a disease characterized by recurrent
itching, wheals and/or angioedema that lasts for more than 6 weeks
in the absence of a precipitating external factor. Since the disease
may sometimes last for years,' it negatively affects the patients’
quality of life and may cause socioeconomical problems. Nonsedating H1-antihistamines are the drug of choice for the firstline treatment and up to a four-fold dose increase is recommended if there is no improvement.” However, high dose antihistamines are ineffective in approximately half of the patients,’ and
in these cases leukotriene receptor antagonists, cyclosporine A, H2

antihistamines or systemic glucocorticoid combinations are also
used in addition to H1-antihistamines.** Recently, studies on the
high efficacy of omalizumab in patients that are refractory to conventional therapy have been reported. Use of omalizumab in CSU
patients was approved both in the USA and the EU in 2014 and it
became the first drug approved for use in patients refractory to H1antihistamines.°°

Omalizumab (Xolair®, Novartis, Switzerland) is a monoclonal
humanized IgG antibody that attaches to unbound IgE and prevents
its attachment with the high or low-affinity receptors (FceRI and
FceRII) on mast cells, basophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes. Thus
it causes a decrease in free IgE levels and a down-regulation of
receptors on cell membranes.’ Its mechanism of action in CSU is not
fully understood. As a modification of allergic response is not aimed
at it is in asthma, a fixed dose of the therapy is recommended. Even
though the doses may differ among centers, the evidence-based
highest efficient dose is 300 mg/4 weeks.°?

Most previous studies including real life data are based on drug
efficacy. Knowledge on the optimal duration of treatment and

management after therapy discontinuation are not clear. Data on
the possible effective factors on treatment response, relapse rates
and retreatment efficacy are very limited. Thus in this study we
aimed to establish efficacy of omalizumab in CSU refractory to
conventional therapy, to identify factors that may be effective on
therapeutic response and relapse, and to evaluate the efficacy of
retreatment in relapsed cases.

Methods

This single-centered retrospective study evaluated the data of
patients diagnosed with CSU that were treated with omalizumab
from 2013 to 2016. The center is located within the university
hospital and it is the only reference allergy-clinical immunology
clinic in the city and the surrounding region.

Patients who were treated with omalizumab without any break
for at least 3 months were included. Omalizumab was administered
300 mg/4 weeks to every patient at the outpatient clinic under
surveillance. Concomitant medications were adjusted at monthly
controls according to the clinical response. The baseline and followup concomitant medication scores (CMS) of patients were calculated retrospectively. Symptom scores were obtained from patient
charts.

The CMS of patients were calculated in a similar way to previous
studies: antihistamines (regular dose, 2 points; 4 times the regular
dose, 8 points), oral glucocorticoids (<11 mg, 5 points; 11—25 mg,
10 points; >25 mg, 15 points), cyclosporine 3.0 mg/kg (8 points),
hydroxychloroquine (6 points) and montelukast (2 points).'°
Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated by urticaria activity score
(UAS). According to this, at their monthly follow-up, patients were
asked to score their symptoms categorically as wheals (none:
0 points, <20 wheals: 1 points, 20—50 wheals: 2 points, >50
wheals: 3 points) and pruritus (none: 0 point, mild: 1 point,
moderate: 2 points, severe: 3 points), making up O—G points in
total.?"!

According to the responses to omalizumab, patients were
grouped as follows: complete responders (UAS = 0 and no increase
in symptoms during follow-up), partial responders (UAS = 1-4),
and non-responders (UAS > 5 or gradually increasing UAS at
follow-up). The patient characteristics of the complete and partial
control groups were compared.

In all patients with complete or partial response, discontinuation of omalizumab was tried at a time after 6 months. Retreatment
was initiated if the recurred disease couldn't be controlled with
concomitant medications. The characteristics of patients who were
symptomatic and asymptomatic after discontinuation of omalizumab were compared. At the time of the study, 4 patients had not
completed their 6 month-therapy and 1 patient was resistant to all
therapies. Therapy discontinuation was not tried in these 5 patients
and they were excluded from that comparison. Study design is
summarized in Figure 1. Data related to other possible triggers and
comorbidities such as serum total IgE, phadiatop and sIgE for food
mix, vitamin B12, thyroid autoantibodies, eosinophil counts,
rheumatological markers, fecal Helicobacter pylori antigen, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythroid sedimentation rate (ESR), antiendomysium and anti-gliadin autoantibodies were recorded
retrospectively. Possible effects of these variables on clinical
response were evaluated.

Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Parameters were expressed as median (25—75 interquartile range;
IQR) unless stated otherwise. Chi-square, Mann—Whitney U and
repeated measures ANOVA tests were used for comparing variables.

Results

Patient characteristics are listed in Table 1. The majority of patients were female (72%), young and had few comorbidities. IgE
levels prior to therapy were slightly high. Seven patients (28%) were
positive for anti thyroid peroxidase (IgG-anti-TPO) and 3 (12%)
were positive for anti thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) autoantibodies. Six
patients (24%) had anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), one of them also
had SS-A and SS-B positivity. Nine patients (36%) were positive for
at least one of ANA, IgG-anti-TPO and IgG-anti-Tg antibodies. Fecal
H. pylori antigen was positive in 11 patients.

Median time from appearance of urticaria symptoms to omalizumab therapy was 44 (15—72) months. Baseline median CMS was
13 (10—15) and UAS was 6 (5.5—6). At the third and sixth months
CMS and UAS had decreased to 2 (0O—6) and 1 (0-1), respectively
(Table 2).

During the first three months, all patients had improved CMS
and UAS. After three months, 2 patients experienced worsened
symptoms and increased need for concomitant medication. They
were accepted as non-responders and omalizumab therapy was
discontinued after the 6th month and 10th month. One patient's
prior systemic steroid and cyclosporine treatments were stopped
until the 3rd month, but systemic steroid therapy was restarted due
to symptomatic worsening. However, since the symptoms were still
better than they were before omalizumab treatment, she was
accepted as a partial-responder and continued omalizumab treatment. The data of these three patients are given in Table 3.

Fourteen (58%) patients had complete response at the end of
their therapies. At the 3rd month, 8 patients (32%) had complete
response. None of these complete-responders had IgG-anti-TPO
autoantibody positivity when compared to partial-responders
(p = 0.058). The time from first symptoms to omalizumab therapy was also markedly shorter in complete responders; however,
the difference was not statistically significant [22 (7-51) months
and 47 (18—80) months, respectively, p = 0.12]. Relapse ratios did
not differ significantly between these two groups (p = 0.63)
(Table 4). Fecal H. pylori antigen, phadiatop, ANA and IgG anti-Tg
positivity, and CRP levels also did not differ between these
groups. Non-responders were not included in statistical analyses
since the number of patients was very low (n = 2).

Eleven patients experienced relapse and omalizumab was
restarted in 10 of them since other medications were not effective
enough. After the reinitiation of omalizumab, 5 of these patients
had complete response and 5 had partial response (therapy duration changing between 1 and 5 months). Seven patients achieved
remission after discontinuation. Time from the last omalizumab
dose was a minimum of 8 weeks and a maximum of 18 months for
these patients. When relapsed and non-relapsed patients were
compared, ANA was negative in all non-relapsed patients but 4 of
11 patients with relapse had positive ANA titers (p = 0.12) (Table 5).
Distribution of genders, CRP levels, and fecal H. pylori antigen and
phadiatop positivity were found similar between relapsed and nonrelapsed patients. Omalizumab was well-tolerated in all patients
and no drug induced adverse effects were recorded.

Discussion
This study shows the high efficacy and tolerability of omalizu
mab therapy in CSU patients refractory to combinations of high
dose non-sedating H1-antihistamines combined with montelukast,

systemic steroids or cyclosporine. Fifty-eight percent of patients
had complete response at the end of their therapies. After therapy
was discontinued at the 6th month, 11 patients (61%) experienced
relapse and 10 of them (91%) received retreatment with omalizumab since they had become refractory to other medications. After
reinitiation, half of these patients had complete and half had partial
response in 1—5 months.

The mechanism of action of omalizumab in CSU remains unclear. Even though a rapid clinical response from the very first day
of administration has been shown, relapses after discontinuation
suggest that the drug acts through a different mechanism than
modifying the underlying disease.'? One of the possible mechanisms is the presence of autoimmunity in these patients. An IgG
against FceRI or IgE, IgE against TPO or IgE against an unidentified
autoantigen are considered to be effective in the pathogenesis.'*
Nevertheless, at present no autoantibody alone can explain the
whole pathogenesis. Even though the mechanism of action is not
clear, the clinical efficacy of the drug in CSU has been shown in
several placebo-controlled studies and studies presenting real life
data.°'°'*~” Similarly, in our study, 32% of patients had complete
and 60% had partial-response at the 3rd month. Only 2 patients
were non-responders to omalizumab. A total of 513 flacons of the
drug were administered and no drug-related systemic adverse effect was reported. Two previous studies on the therapeutic responses of CSU patients reported complete response rates at the
end of treatment as 35.7% (5/14 patients) and 61.5% (8/13 patients).'*'° In a study of 68 CSU patients, Sussman et al. found that
the complete response rate at any time during treatment was 69%.
In the same study, treatment was discontinued in 5 patients since
they became refractory to therapy.'° Our data show the high efficacy of 300 mg/month omalizumab in CSU. Since its mechanism o:
action in CSU is not fully understood, which group of patients
would most likely have a better response cannot be predicted.
When evaluating factors on treatment response, Altrichter et al.
found that patients with IgE-anti-TPO autoantibodies responde

better to omalizumab and these patients also had markedly high
levels of IgG-anti-TPO antibodies.'® This study also showed IgEanti-TPO positivity in 54% of CSU patients. Thirty-six percent of
our patients were also positive for at least one type of IgG type
autoantibody. Interestingly, none of the complete responders had
IgG-anti-TPO positivity. Our results do not corroborate those of
Altricher et al.; however, since our sample size was too small to
prove this hypothesis, future studies are needed to assess whether
this subset of patients has better response to omalizumab.

The optimum duration of therapy and management of recurrent
symptoms after discontinuation of omalizumab are still on debate.
Previous studies reported a significant increase in symptoms after
therapy.” In a study in which patients were followed up after
omalizumab discontinuation, symptom scores increased up to 40
weeks but they never reached the baseline values.'? In another
study which evaluated omalizumab retreatment efficacy, which
only included omalizumab reinitiated patients, Metz et al.
demonstrated early relapse (2—8 weeks) in 23 and late relapse (4—7
months) in 2 of 25 CSU patients whose treatment was discontinued
due to complete response.”° All of these patients had a rapid and
complete response from the very first dose after reinitiation. In a

series of 51 CSU patients by the same researchers, after omalizumab
therapy was discontinued, 12% of patients achieved complete
remission in the 4—16 months follow-up period.” In our study,
after omalizumab discontinuation, 11 patients (61%) reported
worsened symptoms and 10 of them had to be retreated with
omalizumab since they were refractory to high dose H1antihistamines and steroids. There are two possible explanations
for the difference between our and Metz et al.'s relapse ratios. First
of all, our study included an isolated patient group with CSU,
whereas the previous study included both CSU and inducible urticaria patients. Secondly, in our study, at least 8 weeks had passed
from the last dose of omalizumab in symptom-free patients; even
so, any symptom that may develop during the long-term follow-up
of these patients may change the results. Thus we may suggest that
in this group of patients, the early symptom-free period may be
misleading and long-term follow-up is needed.

Since omalizumab acts through IgE, better response rates can be
expected in patients with higher baseline total IgE levels. Kessel
et al. showed a significant association between increased total IgE
levels and disease severity.” Also, free IgE decrease was shown to
be correlated with symptomatic reduction under omalizumab
therapy.'’ In our study, total IgE levels of complete responders
and relapsed patients were almost two-fold higher than partia
responders and non-relapsed patients, respectively, but, this

difference was not statistically significant. We ascribed this to our
study's small sample.

Interestingly, some partial-responders had complete response
after reinitiation, while some complete-responders had partial
response later. Based on these data, despite our small sample size,
we may argue that reinitiation of omalizumab may be a safe option
with variable efficacy.

Finally, all non-relapsed patients were negative for ANA, but not
for IgG-anti-TPO. This finding was not statistically significant when
compared with relapsed patients; however, it may have clinical
importance. In a large population study which compares ANA(+)
and ANA(-—) CSU patients, ANA(+) patients were found to be more
refractory to antihistamine therapy and needed four-fold standard
licensed dose more.’ Also, after 2 months of standard licensed dose
antihistamines, complete freedom from symptoms was reported to
be higher in ANA(—) patients (61.7% vs 49.5%; p = 0.035). Similarly,
Viswanathan et al. showed that the percentage of patients who were
refractory to antihistamines was higher in ANA(+) CSU patients.”*
Though speculative, ANA positivity may be a possible marker for
omalizumab resistance and relapses after discontinuation.

In conclusion, omalizumab seems to be an effective option for
patients with refractory CSU. It is highly efficient in relapsed patients who previously responded well. Autoimmune markers may
be helpful in predicting treatment responses and relapse and
identifying the pathophysiology and possible subtypes of the disease may guide therapeutic decisions.
