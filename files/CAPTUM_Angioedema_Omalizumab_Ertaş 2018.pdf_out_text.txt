Background/aim: Spontaneous wheals and/or angioedema lasting longer than six weeks are described as chronic spontaneous urticaria
(CSU). Omalizumab is used for the treatment of antihistamine-resistant CSU. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), plateletlymphocyte ratio (PLR), mean platelet volume (MPV), and platelet distribution width (PDW) are considered important indicators of
inflammation and platelet activation in chronic diseases.

We aimed to determine the NLR, PLR, MPV, and PDW levels in patients with CSU compared with healthy controls. We also aimed to
investigate the effects of omalizumab therapy on these parameters in CSU patients.

Materials and methods: This hospital-based, retrospective study included 143 patients with CSU and 132 healthy controls with a mean
age of 40.0 + 13.17 and 42.0 + 16.34, respectively. Patients with equal or higher-than-baseline UAS scores at week 12 of omalizumab
treatment were considered nonresponders, others were considered responders. We analyzed the neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelet
counts, NLR, PLR, MPV, and PDW before, during, and after omalizumab treatment and compared the results with those of healthy
controls.

Results: CSU patients presented higher baseline MPV (P = 0.035) and lower baseline PDW values (P < 0.001) than healthy controls.
There were statistically significant increases in the MPV (P < 0.001), MPV/platelet count (P = 0.005), and PDW (P = 0.003) and there
was a statistically significant decrease in the NLR (P = 0.018) during omalizumab treatment. The percent increase of MPV was low in
nonresponders (P = 0.009). Nonresponders had lower PDW values than responders (P = 0.040).

Conclusion: The increase in the MPV and PDW may be due to platelet activation during omalizumab treatment. The decrease in the
NLR may be regarded as an antiinflammatory effect of omalizumab. The effect of omalizumab on platelet and inflammatory markers
may be used to discriminate the responders from nonresponders.

Key words: Chronic spontaneous urticaria, inflammation, platelet, MPV, PDW, NLR, PLR, omalizumab

1. Introduction

Urticaria is a frequent symptom defined by the appearance
of wheals and angioedema (1). Chronic spontaneous
urticaria (CSU), which was defined by at least six weeks
of continuous or recurrent urticaria, is assumed to
occur in approximately 1%-2% of the population (1,2).
The current EAACI/GA*LEN/EDF/WAO _ guideline
on urticaria recommends that second generation H1
antihistamines (sgAH) should be used as the first line
treatment of CSU and that doses are increased up to fourfold if needed to achieve disease control. When this fails,

omalizumab is recommended to be used as a third line
treatment (3).
Omalizumab, a
antiimmunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody, is approved for
treatment of moderate or severe allergic asthma (4).
Recently, it has been approved for the patients with
antihistamine-resistant, severe CSU (4). It shows its effect
by binding IgE to the FceRI receptor on the surface of target

humanized monoclonal

cells, including mast cells and basophils, thereby reducing
receptor expression and the release of inflammatory
mediators (5). In addition, omalizumab has been shown

to be effective in 70%-80% of patients with CSU (6).
However, the cause of this nonresponse to omalizumab
treatment in patients with CSU is still unclear as realworld data concerning omalizumab in CSU patients are
still lacking (6-8). Clearly, new markers that can elucidate
omalizumab’s mode of action and new predictive markers
of anti-IgE treatment can improve our knowledge.

The mean platelet volume (MPV) is an index of
platelet size, while the platelet distribution width (PDW)
is an index of platelet anisocytosis, which results from
pseudopodia formation; these are both important markers
that significantly increase during platelet activation (9,10).
During the inflammation process, an increase or decrease
may be observed in the number and volume of platelets.
MPV has been identified as an inflammatory marker
in the literature; increased MPV has previously been
demonstrated in many diseases, including CSU and other
inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA),
familial Mediterranean fever, and cystic fibrosis (11,12). In
the literature, increased MPV and PDW levels were found
to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular
(CV)/cerebrovascular (CBV) events (12,13). In addition,
obtained by dividing the number of neutrophils by the
number of lymphocytes, the ratio of neutrophils to
lymphocytes (NLR) is considered an important indicator
of inflammation in chronic diseases. At the same time, high
NLRs are considered a bad prognostic factor in chronic
diseases. The platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) has recently
emerged as a simple marker that can be conveniently
calculated by dividing the platelet count by the lymphocyte
count of the whole blood count parameters, similar to
NLR (14,15).

We aimed to determine the changes in inflammation
parameters, such as the NLR, PLR, and platelet parameters
in patients with CSU compared with healthy controls.
We also aimed to investigate the short-term effects of
omalizumab therapy on the NLR, PLR, MPV, MPV/
platelet count, and PDW in patients with CSU. In addition,
we sought to reveal the predictive markers of omalizumab
therapy in patients with CSU using real-world data.

2. Materials and methods
n this study, we retrospectively analyzed CSU patients
who had presented to the outpatient clinic of Kayseri
Education and Research Hospital between January 2014
and April 2017. This hospital-based study included 143
patients with CSU and 132 healthy controls, and it was
approved by the local ethics committee.

CSU was defined by at least six weeks of continuous or
recurrent urticaria as mentioned in the current guidelines
(2). All the patients included in the study were resistant to
antihistamines, and they were patients with severe CSU.
We retrospectively analyzed the baseline neutrophils,
lymphocytes, platelet counts, NLR, PLR, MPV, and

 

 

1256

PDW before the omalizumab treatment compared with
healthy controls. We then observed the changes in these
parameters during omalizumab treatment at week 4 and
week 12.

Age- and sex-matched healthy adults who presented
to the outpatient clinic for regular control visits were
enrolled in the control group. The CSU patients who did
not respond to high-dose antihistamine therapy were
treated with a dose of 300 mg of omalizumab every 4
weeks. Seventeen of 143 CSU patients were excluded from
the analyses at week 4, and 29 were excluded at week 12
due to missing test results. The neutrophils, lymphocytes,
platelet counts, NLR, PLR, MPV, and PDW were analyzed
before the omalizumab injection at weeks 4 (n = 126) and
12 (n = 114) after omalizumab treatment initiation.

The activity/severity of CSU was assessed from the
urticaria activity score (UAS). Briefly, the number of
wheals and severity of pruritus were scored as follows:
number of wheals: 0 = no wheals, 1 = mild (<20 wheals/24
), 2 = moderate (21-50 wheals/24 h), and 3 = intense
wheals (>50wheals/24 h or large confluent areas of wheals);
pruritus: 0 = none,1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = intense
(2). In this study, patients with score of UAS equal to or
higher than three despite high dose antihistamine therapy
were accepted as patients with severe CSU. The response
statuses of the CSU patients were assessed at week 12.
Patients who had lower UAS than baseline UAS or UAS
= 0 were considered responders. Those with equal or
higher UAS than baseline UAS at week 12 of omalizumab
treatment were considered nonresponders (6,7).

Venous blood samples were collected in anticoagulant
specimen tubes containing K,EDTA (Becton Dickinson
Vacutainers). Complete blood count analyses were
performed using an automated complete blood cell
counter SysmexXN-9000 analyzer (Sysmex Corporation,
Kobe, Japan) in two hours.

 

2.1. Statistical analysis

Analyses were conducted using SPSS version 20 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA) and TURCOSA (Turcosa Analytics Ltd.
Co., Turkey) statistical softwares. Parametric variables were
presented as means and standard deviations, nonparametric
variables were presented as medians and interquartile
ranges (lower and upper quartiles). Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test and histogram analyses were used to determine
whether continuous variables were normally distributed.
Levene’s test was used for the evaluation of homogeneity
of variances. Number of cases and percentages were used
for categorical variables. Two independent groups of
parametric variables were compared using Student’s t-test.
For nonparametric variables Mann-Whitney U test was
administered. Categorical data were analyzed by Chisquare or Fisher's exact test, where applicable. The change
in MPV and MPV/Platelet count by time was investigated
ERTAS et al. / Turk J Med Sci

using repeated measures analysis of variance with paired-t
test as a post-test. Greenhouse-Geisser correction was
used when sphericity assumption was violated. Friedman
test with Wilcoxon signed rank test as a post-test were
used to evaluate differences between variables across time
(ie. NLR, PLR, PDW, and platelet count). A P-value less
than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

3. Results

There was no significant difference in the baseline
characteristics related to age and sex (Tables 1 and 2; P >
0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in
the neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet counts, NLR, or PLR
values between CSU patients and healthy controls (P >
0.05).

4 and week 12 of omalizumab treatment (Tables 3 and 4;
Figure 2).

3.3. New predictor factors of the omalizumab response
in patients with CSU

The increase of MPV was low in nonresponders during the
2 weeks of omalizumab treatment (P = 0.009; Table 4). At
week 4 of treatment, the nonresponders had statistically
significantly low PDW levels (P = 0.040; Table 4; Figure 3).
When grouping the patients according to disease duration
by the median of 36 months, the increase of PDW was
low in patients with longer disease duration (<36 months,
median, IQR; 1.27 (0 to 3.33); >36 months, median, IQR; 0
(-1.55 to 1.28), P = 0.012).

 

4. Discussion

The results of this study showed that most of the severe
CSU patients whose disease was resistant to antihistamines
exhibited higher MPV levels than the control group did
as found in previous studies (16-19). As an easy, costeffective, and less time-consuming marker, MPV is the
most studied platelet activation marker (17).

Our results confirm and complement earlier studies
showing that MPV is high in patients with severe CSU,
which is a comparable result to those of previous studies
(18,19). Although there is a previous publication that
did not find a link between platelet markers and CSU
(10), Chandrashekar et al. (17) found that high MPV and
PDW levels are correlated with severe CSU and platelet
aggregation. However, we observed low PDW values
in our study, which may have been due to a difference
in the current patient population, which consisted of all

1258

antihistamine-resistant and severe CSU patients. As in
our study, Magen et al. (18) showed that MPV is higher
in severe CSU patients than in both mild CSU patients
and the control group. This may have been due to the high
activity of inflammatory markers in severe CSU; the MPV
values may indicate the intensity of the inflammatory
process. As in the current study, prospective platelet
activation markers, such as the PDW and MPV/platelet
count, have been investigated in different diseases (17). In
fact, we found higher NLR levels in patients with severe
CSU than in healthy controls, although the difference was
not statistically significant. In addition, Karabay et al. (20)
found high NLR levels in CSU patients. This confirms a
possible inflammatory process in patients with CSU.
Omalizumab exerts its effects quickly, and it has
high treatment efficacy in patients with CSU who do
not respond to high doses of antihistamines (4). One of
the aims of this study was to investigate changes in the
markers of platelet function, such as the MPV, PDW, and
MPV/platelet count during omalizumab treatment in
a large patient population with antihistamine-resistant
CSU. This issue had not been previously addressed in CSU
patients. However, the effect of omalizumab therapy on
MPV was observed without finding any significant change
in a small patient group with asthma (21). Our results
indicate that, at week 12 of treatment with omalizumab,
there was a significant effect on the MPV, PDW, and MPV/
platelet count. In the current study, the size of platelets
was observed to increase during omalizumab treatment.
The mechanism of this effect of omalizumab had not been
investigated in patients with CSU before. Gasparyan et
al. (22) showed a similar effect on MPV during anti-TNF

(tumor necrosis factor) treatment in patients with RA.
They mentioned that excessive proinflammatory cytokines
and high acute-phase reactants can suppress the size of
platelets via the effects of megakaryopoiesis in patients
with inflammatory diseases (22). Similarly, it is known
that omalizumab shows its overall effects by stopping
the degranulation of mast cells; reducing the secretion
of mediators, cytokines, and chemokines; and showing
additional antiinflammatory effects (23). The larger size
of platelets could be due to lifting the suppression and
modulation of megakaryopoiesis during the omalizumab
therapy. We also found a statistically significant decrease
in the NLR during omalizumab treatment. This can be
accepted as a decrease of the inflammatory process in
severe CSU patients during the treatment. Gdkmen et al.

 

(24) showed a similar decrease of NLR and CRP (C-reactive
protein) levels during biological therapy in RA patients.
These results also confirm our hypothesis concerning the
suppression of inflammatory markers during omalizumab
therapy. MPV can be considered a possible biomarker to
predict omalizumab treatment response in patients with
CSU.

Thrombocytopenia can be seen as a side effect of
omalizumab, and this was previously shown in primates,
albeit not in humans (25,26). Although a slight decrease
was seen, there was no statistically significant change
in the thrombocyte counts in the current study (Table
4). The mechanism of thrombocytopenia in primates
remains unclear. Ledford (25) explained that it could
be because the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with the

highest binding affinity seem particularly prone to causing
thrombocytopenia; however, this effect could stem from
binding of complexes (mAb-IgE) to the surface of platelets
via an IgG receptor (25). In addition, platelets are the source
of inflammatory mediators implicated in histamine release
from basophils and mast cells (17). It can be hypothesized
that the large platelets seen during the therapy may be due
to a direct or indirect stabilizing effect of omalizumab on
platelets due to its possible antiinflammatory effects.

It was previously shown that omalizumab may be
associated with arterial thrombotic events in asthmatic
patients (27). Recently, Iribarren et al. (28) showed a
higher incidence rate of CV/CBV events in omalizumabtreated patients. The cause of the high risk of CV/CBV

1260

is still unknown (8,9). Platelets play a pivotal role in
arteriosclerosis and arterial thrombotic disorders (29);
high MPV and PDW levels are associated with a variety
of established risk factors, such as CV/CBV disorders.
In addition, platelets are thought to be involved in the
pathogenesis of CSU (17). The mechanisms of MPV
changes have not been fully explored yet. However, NLR is
known asa novel CV risk factor (30). The decrease of NLR
during omalizumab therapy may be considered a good
prognostic factor for CV/CBV.

Our findings also demonstrated that increasing levels
of MPV and levels of PDW are linked to the CSU response
at week 12 of omalizumab treatment; to our knowledge,
this is the first time this has been shown. A low increase

in the percentage of MPV during 12 weeks of omalizumab
treatment and a low value of PDW at week 12 were seen
in nonresponders (Figure 3). Long disease duration in
patients with CSU may be thought to be correlated with
the severity of disease. So, lower increase of PDW during
12 weeks of omalizumab treatment in patients with long
disease duration can be associated with the resistance to
omalizumab treatment. These results were associated with
the ineffectiveness of omalizumab treatment; however,
the explanation for this finding is still unclear. A possible
explanation related to nonresponder patients may be the
inability to bind to the omalizumab receptors (7), faster
clearance of omalizumab (7), or an unknown blocking
mechanism. Consequently, in the nonresponder group,
omalizumab did not show an effect either on clinical
examination or laboratory tests. Possible usage of MPV
and PDW values as inexpensive and easy biomarkers for
predicting the response of omalizumab in patients with
CSU needs to be emphasized as an important issue. On

the other hand, even though the mean values of MPV
(Baseline: 9.97, week 4: 10.30, and week 12: 10.49) and
median values of PDW (Baseline: 15.7, week 4: 15.8,
and week 12: 15.8) are close, the difference is statistically
significant. However, it is still unclear whether these
values may be useful parameters in clinical practice. More
comprehensive prospective studies are needed to elucidate
this issue.

In conclusion, MPV may be an important indicator
of inflammation in CSU, as well as in other diseases. The
subsequent increase of MPV, and other effects presented
on PDW and NIR can be regarded as the effects of
omalizumab on the platelets and peripheral blood cells
in patients with CSU. This finding is also supported
in that the MPV and PDW did not increase in the
nonresponder group. Our findings need to be investigated
with sophisticated in vivo and in vitro platelet activation
tests and other inflammation markers in comprehensive
prospective studies.
