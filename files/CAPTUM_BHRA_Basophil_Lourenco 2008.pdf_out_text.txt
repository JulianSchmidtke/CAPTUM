Background Basophils and mast cells are the main target cells in chronic idiopathic
urticaria (CIU). Besides the basopenia, intrinsic defects of the anti-IgE crosslinking signalling pathway of basophils have been described in CIU.

Objectives We sought to investigate the profile of expression of activation markers
on basophils of patients with CIU and to explore the effect of interleukin (IL)-3
priming upon anti-IgE cross-linking stimuli through expression of activation
markers and basophil histamine releasability.

Methods Evaluation of the surface expression of FceRIa, CD63, CD203c and
CD123 on whole blood basophils of patients with CIU undergoing autologous
serum skin test (ASST) was performed by flow cytometry. The effect of pretreatment with IL-3 in the anti-IgE response was analysed by the expression o}
basophil activation markers and histamine release using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Results Blood basophils of patients with CIU were reduced in number and displayed increased surface expression of FceRIx, which was positively correlated
with the IgE serum levels. Upregulation of expression of both surface markers

 

CD203c and CD63 was verified on basophils of patients with CIU, regardless o:

 

ASST response. High expression of IL-3 receptor on basophils was detected only
in ASST+ patients with CIU. Pretreatment with IL-3 upregulated CD203c expression concomitantly with the excreting function of blood basophils and induced a
quick hyper-responsiveness to anti-IgE cross-linking on basophils of patients with
CIU compared with healthy controls.
Conclusions Basophils of patients with CIU showed an activated profile, possibly
due to an in vivo priming. Functionally, basophils have high responsiveness to

 

IL-3 stimulation, thereby suggesting that defects in the signal transduction pathway after IgE cross-linking stimuli are recoverable in subjects with chronic
urticaria.

Chronic urticaria is a common skin disorder characterized by
recurrent and transitory itchy weals occurring regularly for
more than 6 weeks.’ In most patients the cause remains
unknown, in which case it is defined as chronic idiopathic
urticaria (CIU). CIU appears to be of autoimmune origin in a
substantial percentage of cases, as approximately 35-40% of
patients have circulating IgG antibodies directed against the
a-subunit of the high-affinity IgE receptor,” and an additional
5-10% have antibodies against the IgE molecule.* The auto

immune subgroup represents the most severe form of chronic
urticaria.''* Patients with chronic urticaria without autoantibodies still have no clear cause for their urticaria, but it has
been suggested that a population of patients has intrinsic basophil or mast cell defects, which may be the underlying cause
of hives in these patients. However, some caution is required
in extrapolating the results from circulating basophils to those
sequestered in the affected urticarial tissues, an issue that

requires further investigation.

980 Activation profile of basophils in chronic urticaria, F.D. Lourenco et al.

Basophils represent <0°5% of total leucocytes in peripheral
blood; they are generated and mature in the bone marrow
and circulate in the periphery as fully differentiated forms.
Stimulated basophils release preformed histamine, the major
mediator of urticaria, and newly synthesized factors, such as
leukotriene C, and interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13. In CIU, the
occurrence of basopenia has been well described, which has
been correlated with urticarial activity.*° One possible reason
for the reduced number of basophils in CIU is that these cells
are actively recruited into lesional skin.’

The activation markers on basophils have been parameters
for evaluating the degree of cellular activation in atopic
disease as well as in CIU, based on the allergens or seruminducing activity of basophils, respectively. In resting basophils, CD63 is anchored in the basophilic granule membrane
that contains histamine, and its exposure to the outside of
the cells reflects cell degranulation due to fusion between
granules and plasma membranes.* CD63 is expressed by different cell types, such as basophils, tissue mast cells, macrophages and platelets.” CD203c appears to be selectively
expressed on the basophil/mastocyte lineage.'° CD203c is a
multifunctional ectoenzyme called ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 3 (E-NPP3).'° Both activation
markers, CD63 and CD203c, under different kinetics, are
rapidly upregulated on basophils after stimulation with aller

from patients with CIU with positive autologous serum skin
tests (ASSTs) significantly upregulate basophil CD63 as we
as CD203c and correlate with basophil histamine release, particularly if highly sensitive donor basophils are used.'*'*
Most investigation has been focused on the CIU serum activity in the activation of donor basophils as a screening tool.
However, direct evidence of basophil activation in the
peripheral blood could also possibly be used to monitor urticarial activity. An enhanced expression of CD63 in basophils
in vivo that is not associated with serum factors has been
shown for patients with CIU.'®

IL-3 has been shown to improve basophil histamine release

 

upon stimulation with sera from patients with CIU, partially
converting nonreleaser basophils into cells that respond to sera
if they are unresponsive to anti-IgE but respond normally to
other secretory stimuli.'’ Basophils in patients with CIU are
considered to have possible specific intrinsic defects, such as
being hyporesponsive to anti-IgE,”"'**° but hyper-responsive
to healthy or patient serum. However, if there are some
intrinsic basophil defects in CIU, the effectiveness of IL-3
stimulation in anti-IgE cross-linking histamine release is
unknown.

In the current study, we sought to investigate the intensity of FceRIa receptor expression as well as expression of
the activation/degranulation markers CD203c, CD63 and
CD123 on blood basophils from ASST+ and ASST— patients
with CIU. In addition, we sought to explore the efficacy of
IL-3 priming upon anti-IgE stimulus through expression of
basophil activation markers and basophil histamine releasability.

Patients and methods

Study subjects

All patients with continuous CIU were selected from the Dermatological Outpatient Clinic of the Hospital das Clinicas de
Sao Paulo (HC-FMUSP). They had had weals at least four times
a week for 6 weeks or longer. Patients with physical urticaria,
urticarial vasculitis and food allergy were excluded. Antihistamines were withdrawn 48 h before the study, and none of the
patients was taking corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
drugs at the time of venipuncture. Samples from 29 patients
with CIU (five men and 24 women; median age 42:5 years,
range 20-66) and 26 healthy control (HC) individuals (eight
men and 18 women; median age 37 years, range 22-65) were
collected and stored at —70°C. All subjects gave written
informed consent, and the study protocol was approved by the
institutional ethics committee of the HC-FMUSP.

Autologous serum skin test

All patients underwent skin testing with autologous serum
(ASST) performed following standard methods”! with fresh
autologous serum injected intradermally into the volar forearm
skin. A positive skin test was defined as when the seruminduced weal was red and had a diameter 21:5 mm than that

of the saline-induced response at 30 min.

Flow cytometry analysis

To analyse the expression of FceRI or activation surface markers on basophils, cells were stained with a combination of
labelled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and measured by
means of flow cytometry. In brief, 100 tL of whole blood
was incubated for 30 min on ice with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled goat antihuman IgE (Caltag, Carlsbad, CA,
U.S.A.), phycoerythrin (PE)-labelled FceRI o-chain mAb
AER-37 (CRA1; Immunotech International, Marseille, France),
or their isotype-matched controls. Cells were initially gated
based on the histogram defined by forward scatter and side
scatter, and then a second gate of high-density FITC-IgE+ cells
was defined to select the basophil population. To evaluate the
specific activation markers, the follow mAbs were used:
R-PE-labelled CD203c; PE-labelled CD63 (Immunotech International); and PE-Cy5 (cyanin 5)-labelled CD123 [IL-3 receptor & (IL-3Ra), 9F5], from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, CA,
U.S.A.). After incubation, the cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/0°5%
(BSA), processed with a Coulter EPICS XL-ML flow cytometer
(Miami, FL, U.S.A.), and analysed with System II software. At
least 500 basophils were assessed. The absolute number of

bovine serum albumin

basophils in the peripheral blood was determined as the percentage of positive cells multiplied by the total leucocyte
count performed using the Cell-Dyn 1400 (Abbott, Chicago,
IL, U.S.A.). Data were expressed as net median fluorescence
intensity (MFI) (actual MFI — MFI of the irrelevant IgG

control). All incubation steps were performed at 4°C. For

anti-IgE stimulation assays, the gate on side scatter
with PE-CD203c+ cells or the gate with PE-CD63+ and highdensity FITC-IgE+ cells was defined to select the basophil

population, analysing at least 500 cells.

Basophil activation and histamine-release reaction

Whole blood (100 tL) was incubated with human recombinant IL-3 (4ng mL7'; BD Pharmingen) for 10 min at 37°C.
After incubation, the cells were incubated with 12°5 pig mL!
of anti-IgE (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) in PBS containing 0°3% BSA, 2 pmol L™' CaCl, and 1 pmol L™' MgCl, for
15 and 40 min at 37°C. After incubation, the reaction was
stopped with 100 wL of cold PBS/0:3% BSA solution containing 20 mol L™! ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid. The supernatants were separated by means of centrifugation for
histamine measurement and the cells for flow cytometry analysis. Spontaneous histamine release (basal) was evaluated by
measuring histamine concentration in the supernatant of
unstimulated cells. Aliquots of cells underwent four freeze—
thaw cycles to determine total basophil histamine content. The
results were expressed as percentage of total histamine content calculated by using the following formula: (sample —
basal) /(total — basal) X 100.

Histamine assay

Basophil histamine release as well as plasma histamine levels
were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA), instructions

according to the manufacturer’s

(a) 256

 

(Immuno-Biological Lab, Hamburg, Germany). The optical
density reading was performed at 450 nm in an ELISA microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, U.S.A.) with a
SOFT max PRO program.

Statistical analysis

Data are presented as means. The Mann—Whitney U-test was
used to compare variables between patients with CIU and HC
subjects. Correlations of data were analyzed by the nonparametric Spearman test. The Kruskal—Wallis test with Dunn’s
post-test was used to compare nonpaired data between three

sets of data. P < 0-05 was considered significant.

Results

Basopenia and FceRI surface expression on basophils
of patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria

To verify the expression of the high-affinity IgE receptor
(FceRI) on basophils from peripheral blood, patients with
CIU underwent skin testing with autologous serum (ASST).
Initial experiments were designed to quantify basophils in
peripheral blood and to ascertain the plasma histamine levels
of patients with CIU. To determine the absolute number of
blood basophils, the percentage of basophils stained for antiIgE by flow cytometry as shown in Figure 1 was multiplied
by the leucocyte number. The enumeration of basophils
showed marked basopenia in patients with CIU, independent
of a positive or negative ASST (Fig. 1). The occurrence of
basopenia in patients with CIU is well known through the use

through flow cytometry.® The reduced percentage and absolute number of blood basophils in patients with CIU was
comparable with the small amount of plasma histamine, that
was 14-fold lower than in HC individuals. For evaluation of
FceRIo expression, the AER-37 (CRA1) mAb was used, which
reacts with the o-chain of FceRI and does not block IgE binding.’* Figure 2(a) shows that basophils from patients with
CIU had a significantly higher expression of FceRIa compared
with basophils of the HC group; this was verified in both
ASST+ and ASST— patients with CIU. Total serum IgE levels
were found to be heterogeneous in patients with CIU (median
312'5 Ul mL', range 12-588°5), which were positively correlated (r = 0-567, P= 0-011) with MFI values of FceRIo
expression on basophils (Fig. 2b).

intense occurrence of activation markers in the peripheral
blood, as confirmed by CD203c and CD63 surface markers.

Therefore, we examined the effectiveness of IL-3

anti-IgE cross-linking, expression of CD203c on the basophils

anti-IgE-stimulated cells minus MFI from baseline expression).
Even with subtracting the CD203c baseline expression, a nota
ble increase of CD203c expression on basophils was detected.

It was noticed that throughout the time of anti-IgE stimulation, increasing CD203c surface expression occurred only on
basophils of the HC group, as basophils of patients with CIU
had already been upregulated at 15 min of stimulation. A similar profile of CD63 expression on basophils upon anti-IgE
stimulation was detectable between patients with CIU and HC
individuals, with both groups having increased CD63 expression with anti-IgE cross-linking (Fig. 4). As noticed for
CD203c, increasing CD63 AMFI during anti-IgE stimulation
was verified only on basophils from the control group.

The effect of preincubation with IL-3 upon anti-IgE stimulation of basophil histamine release was evaluated. As shown in
Figure 5, IL-3 treatment by itself induced an increased histamine release by basophils from patients, which was markedly
enhanced after 15 min of anti-IgE stimulation compared with
basophil histamine release from control subjects. Interestingly,
the patients whose histamine release upon anti-IgE stimulation
was above the median value (41:67 ng mL™') belonged to the
ASST+ subgroup (75%). After 40 min, unstimulated cells
from patients with CIU primed with IL-3 maintained an
increased basophil histamine release, whereas after anti-IgE
stimulation a similar level of histamine release was observed
between basophils from control individuals and _ patients.
These results indicate that IL-3 induces both the functional
ability to release histamine and upregulation of expression of
CD203c molecules on basophils of patients with CIU. More

Discusssion

The findings of this study demonstrated that basophils in
peripheral blood of patients with CIU have an activated profile, displaying increased FceRIa expression simultaneously
with upregulation of CD203c and CD63 expression. Treatment
with IL-3 by itself induced an enhancement of CD203c molecule expression and basophil histamine release in patients with
CIU. Functionally, the basophils in CIU are prone to IL-3
responsiveness, leading to an increased release of histamine
upon anti-IgE cross-linking.

We verified that the few basophils circulating in the peripheral blood of patients with CIU exhibited a high intensity
of FceRI% expression compared with the basophils from HC
individuals. Basopenia has been well documented in CIU,
which could be associated with urticarial activity, mainly in
patients with functional autoantibodies able to induce histamine-releasing activity in vitro.” In our findings, the marked
reduction of blood basophils was verified in both ASST+ and
ASST— patients with CIU. A positive correlation of FceRIo.
expression on basophils with IgE serum levels in CIU suggests
that enhancement of FcéRIa expression on the basophil surface is regulated by IgE. Therefore, variable IgE serum level
was found in patients with CIU. There is no relationship
between increased incidence of either atopic status or elevated
total serum IgE in patients with CIU.’* It is known that the
synthesis of FcéRI is constitutive, and that IgE stabilizes its

4

presence on the cell surface,** modulating the intensity of

effector responses.”” Indeed, other factors, such as IL-4, may
synergize with IgE in increasing the percentage of FceRI+
cells*® and the IgE-mediated FceRI expression on cord bloodderived mast cells.” Whether the upregulation of FceRIa on
basophils of patients with CIU is due to IgE, in synergy or not
with other serum factors, remains to be explored.

The activated status of basophils in CIU was verified by the
upregulation of expression of both CD203c and CD63, again,
regardless of in vivo serum reactivity. Peripheral blood CD203c
is exclusively and constitutively expressed on the outer basophil membrane.’ The biological significance of CD203c
(E-NPP3) expression on basophils remains unknown, but this
marker is upregulated very quickly in response to specific
allergens, anti-IgE, and anti-FceRI stimulation.'°'** Heightened expression of CD63 on basophils from patients with CIU
has been reported for enriched basophil preparations compared with those from nonallergic individuals, whereas no difference was found in CD203c expression.'® One reason for
the high CD203c expression found in our study is probably
the use of whole blood evaluation instead of an enriched cell
preparation. We evaluated basophil activation markers in
whole blood to avoid any interference on their constitutive
CD203c expression, as this molecule could be quickly upregulated in response to some stimuli.

The reduced number of blood basophils in CIU has been
suggested to occur by an active recruitment of these cells
from the circulation into weals by expression of endothelial
adhesion molecules in response to local chemokine and cytokine production.”’'? Migration of basophils through the endothelium is promoted by endogenous cytokines, such as IL-1,
IL-3, and several chemokines. In the presence of IL-3,
chemotaxis is selectively enhanced in basophils by transendothelial migration.” IL-3 exhibits diverse effects on human
basophils, including development,*° growth and differentiation factor,*! migration,” histamine release, and augmentation of cytokine generation as well as inhibition of
apoptosis.*? Moreover, IL-3 stimulation is able to convert
anti-IgE nonreleasing basophils into releasing basophils,
showing recoverable defect(s) in the signal transduction pathway after IgE cross-linking. '”

The findings showed that IL-3 stimulation is able to induce
upregulation of CD203c expression on basophils from patients
with CIU, concomitantly with the release of histamine. If
CD203c upregulation represents a distinct point in the signalling pathway or a different functional endpoint, it seems likely
that CD203c upregulation, degranulation, and histamine
release occur simultaneously in response to IL-3 priming.
Differently from in vivo CD63 upregulation in patients with
CIU, IL-3 stimulation upon anti-IgE stimuli was detected similarly on basophils of patients and controls. Only some of them
had an increased CD63 expression upon anti-IgE stimuli. In
fact, preactivation of the basophils with IL-3 does not upregulate CD63 expression, whereas it has been observed to increase
assay sensitivity.** The mechanism for the improved assay sensitivity is unknown, but early events of upregulation were
found at the level of Raf-1-Mek-Erk.**

Activation profile of basophils in chronic urticaria, F.D. Lourengo et al. 985

In general, basophils from patients with CIU have been
considered to be hyporesponsive to anti-IgE stimulus,*”*''*
suggesting an abnormal regulation of the signalling path
19,20
way.

We observed for the first time that preincubation
with IL-3 induced a hyper-responsiveness for anti-IgE stimulus
in the CIU group compared with the control group. Kinetics
of anti-IgE cross-linking demonstrated that IL-3 induced a faster histamine release from basophils of patients with CIU than
from those of HC individuals, probably due to their in vivo
activated phenotype. Curiously, the basophils of some ASST+
patients with CIU released more histamine upon anti-IgE stimulus. Also, these patients showed high expression of IL-3Ra
on basophils, which may explain their hyperactivity to IL-3
priming for degranulation. Although basophils from CIU are
less responsive to some stimuli, they are hyper-responsive to
serum either from healthy individuals or from patients with
ClU.”° The serum factor responsible for the increased responsiveness of basophils of patients with CIU has not yet been
identified, but it is not clearly related to the presence of serological factors such as histamine release activity and/or FceRIa
autoantibodies.** Although it is hard to interpret findings with
surviving peripheral blood basophils in patients with CIU, our
finding suggests possible intrinsic basophil defect(s) that renders them susceptible to circulating mediator(s), as verified by
the hyper-responsiveness following pretreatment with IL-3.
Furthermore, the peculiar activated profile of basophils in
patients with CIU may possibly contribute to their migration
into lesional skin.

In summary, our data show an activated profile of blood
basophils in patients with CIU, possibly due to an in vivo priming. Upregulation of marker activation/degranulation was
coincident with the high intensity of FceRIa on basophils
from patients with CIU. Furthermore, in CIU, IL-3 treatment
by itself as well as upon IgE cross-linking induced the histamine-excreting function of basophils, suggesting a recoverable
defect in the signalling transduction pathway on basophils of
patients with CIU.
