ABSTRACT

Background: The question how second-generation antihistamines (sgAHs) should be used

when chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is under control with omalizumab is still

unanswered.

Objective We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of as-needed sgAHs in patients with

well-co

ntrolled urticaria under omalizumab treatment.

Methods: Patients from four different urticaria centers who were treated with omalizumab

300 mg/4 weeks for at least 3 months, had well-controlled urticaria (Urticaria Control Test:

16>UCT=12) and were using sgAHs only if needed, were included in this study. In order to

assess effectiveness of sgAHs, change in the itch, hives and total itch-hives scores before and

after sgAHs were evaluated using modified urticaria activity score-twice daily.

 

Results: Fifty-three patients [38 female (71.7%)] with mean age 41.1 + 11.4 years were

included in this study. Median sgAH intake per patient throughout the 4 week-intervals was 3

(2-5) ta

 

blets. sgAH intake decreased itch, hives and total itch-hives scores 45.7% + 52.9,

 

 

42.4% + 39.1 and 50.2% + 51.1, respectively (p<0.001 for all). This decrease was similar in

both isolated-urticaria and urticaria-and-angioedema phenotypes. Baseline IgE levels were
positively correlated with the decrease of three symptom scores (r=0.31, p=0.05; r=0.375,
p=0.017; r=0.31, p=0.05, respectively) that showed in patients with higher baseline total IgE

levels, as needed sgAH intake decreased the symptom scores less.

Conclusions: Our study showed that sgAHs may still be an effective option for the treatment
of the intermittent symptoms in patients with well-controlled urticaria under omalizumab
treatment. Baseline total IgE levels may be used as a potential biomarker for sgAH

effectiveness in these patients.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) presents itself with the development of transient
hives (wheals) and/or angioedema lasting longer than 6 weeks or more, without any external
trigger. CSU affects nearly all age groups in the population. It has an estimated life time
prevalence of approximately 0.5-1%, and its prevalence has an increasing trend (1). CSU
causes severe impairment in patients’ quality of life (QoL) (2). The aim of treatment in CSU
is complete disease control with absence of signs and symptoms, and normalization of QoL
(3). Second-generation H1-antihistamines (sgAHs) are the recommended first-line treatment
option for CSU and increasing sgAHs dose up to fourfold as the second-line treatment is

recommended in case of inadequate control with standard dose of sgAHs. For the

antihistamine refractory patients, omalizumab is the only licensed third-line approach, of
which the clinical efficacy and safety in CSU has been shown in several clinical trials and

real-life studies (3-5).

The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI)/Global
Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA2LEN)/European Dermatology Forum
(EDF)/World Allergy Organization (WAO) guideline on urticaria recommends omalizumab
as an add-on treatment option to sgAHs (3). The guideline also recommends using
pharmacotherapy following the principle of “as much as needed and as little as possible”
aiming complete symptomatic relief (3). However, since there is no adequate literature
support, the guideline does not give clear recommendations on whether sgAHs should be
discontinued in order to lessen the pharmacotherapy after initiation of omalizumab. An
opinion on this subject suggests rapid discontinuation of sgAHs after omalizumab is initiated
in all patients since these patients were already resistant to antihistamines before (6, 7).
Supporting this idea, in a review of 16 studies, it has been shown that omalizumab was
effective without the need for concomitant sgAHs in up to 60% of patients (5). Another
opinion on how to manage sgAHs together with omalizumab opposes rapid discontinuation of
sgAHs since they may still be effective (6). As shown in our previous studies, in clinical
practice we also try rapid discontinuation of sgAHs in the first 3 months of therapy in wellcontrolled urticaria [urticaria activity score over 7 days (UAS7) < 6 or urticaria control test
(UCT) = 12], and recommend the patients to use sgAHs only as-needed in case of intermittent
urticarial symptoms (6, 8). Previous studies showed that there were patients that develop

intermittent symptoms although they fulfill the well-controlled urticaria criteria under

omalizumab. A pooled analysis of ASTERIA-I, ASTERIA-II and GLACIAL studies
demonstrated that after treatment with omalizumab 300 mg/4 weeks for 12 weeks, complete
response (UAS7=0) was noted in 49%, 54% and 47%, and well-controlled urticaria
(UAS7<6) was noted in 67%, 76% and 62% of the patients, respectively (9). The 15-22%
difference between the complete response and well-controlled urticaria groups points out the
patients who still have intermittent urticarial symptoms although the disease is under control

with omalizumab.

Even though we recommend these patients to use as-needed sgAH whenever they are
symptomatic, the effectiveness of this treatment is not clear. Therefore, this study aims to
investigate the effectiveness of as-needed sgAHs in patients with well-controlled urticaria

under omalizumab treatment.

METHODS

This study involves CSU patients under omalizumab treatment from four different
urticaria centers in Turkey. All patients were treated with 300 mg doses of omalizumab every

4 weeks for at least 3 months. In all centers, in order to assess the disease control in the

previous interval, patients underwent UCT scoring (UCT=16 defined complete controlled
urticaria, 16>UCT=12 defined well-controlled urticaria and UCT<12 defined poor-controlled
urticaria) in every visit and omalizumab was administered at the very same visit. To evaluate
the effectiveness of as-needed sgAHs, all patients were recommended to lower and, if
possible, discontinue daily sgAHs and to use sgAHs as-needed from the very first visit, which
was a routine procedure applied in all centers apart from this study. Other than this, routine

medical treatments of the patients, if any, were unchanged.

Patients who consented to enroll in the study were given urticaria activity score-twice
daily (UAStp) form, which was developed and validated previously to assess disease activity
and modified by us for this study to evaluate the effectiveness of as-needed sgAHs (10).
According to this modified scoring system, during an interval, patients assessed sgAH-free

days according to the standard UAStp as itch (0O= none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe itch

 

severity at each assessment) and hives (O=none, 1=1-6, 2=7-12, 3=>12 hives at each

 

assessment) scores for each half of the day (every 12 hours). On the days with an as-needed
sgAH intake, patients scored the severity of their symptoms for the 4 hours before and after
the sgAH use according to these scores. In standard UAS 7p evaluation, arithmetical mean of
the scores from the first and second half of the day were calculated. Since the aim of our study
is to determine the possible changes in the itch and hives severity with sgAH intake,
arithmetical daily mean of the scores before and after the sgAH use were not calculated,
instead, scores before and after sgAH use were calculated separately, compared to each other
and mean percentage change between the scores after sgAH use was calculated. All patients

scored their daily symptoms and recorded the number of sgAHs for a single 4-week interval.

Patients who 1) had concomitant inducible urticaria, 2) had isolated-angioedema phenotype,
3) had poor-controlled urticaria at the end of 3 months of omalizumab treatment, 4) did not
use any sgAH during an interval, or 5) could not discontinue routine daily sgAHs, were
excluded from the study. Demographic information, baseline IgE values and UCT scores of
intervals were obtained from the patient charts. This study was approved by the institutional

ethical committee (Erciyes University Medical Ethical Committee, decision no: 2020/179).

Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 17 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois,
USA). Since all variables were not normally distributed, within-group comparisons were
made using Wilcoxon test and between-group comparisons were made using the MannWhitney U-test. Correlations between continuous variables performed using Pearson

correlation. p< 0.05 was considered significant.

RESULTS

 

Fifty-three patients [38 female (71.7%)] with the mean age of 41.1 + 11.4 years were
included in this study. Twenty-eight patients (53%) had isolated-urticaria and 25 (47%) had
urticaria-and-angioedema phenotype. Mean baseline total IgE level prior to omalizumab

treatment was 333.1 + 508.9 IU/mL.

 

 

Mean UCT scores in the evaluation visits was 13.05 + 1.19 points. Omalizumab was
administered 300 mg every 4 weeks, and during a single interval all patients used as-needed
sgAHs 188 times in total. Median sgAH intake during 4 weeks-intervals was 3 (2-5) tablets
per patient. UCT scores and sgAH intake frequency of the same interval showed a negative

correlation (r= -0.441; p=0.003).

Mean itch, hives and total itch-hives scores before and after as-needed sgAH intake

 

were listed in Table 1. Mean total itch-hives score was 2.69 + 1.45 points before as-needed

 

sgAH intake, and decreased to 1.64 + 1.58 points after sgAH intake (p<0.001). When itch and
hives scores were evaluated separately, both scores decreased significantly similarly after

sgAH intake (Table 1).

(p<0.001 for all).

In addition, patients with higher baseline total IgE levels showed significantly less

improvement in itch, hives and total itch-hives scores after as-needed sgAH intake (r=0.31,

 

 

p=0.05; r=0.375, p=0.017; r=0.31, p=0.05, respectively) (Figure 1). No such correlation was

found between baseline total IgE levels and sgAH intake frequency or UCT scores.

DISCUSSION

Our study showed that in CSU patients with well-controlled urticaria under
omalizumab treatment, sgAHs decreased itch and hives scores approximately 45% when
needed during an omalizumab treatment interval. This decrease was similar in both isolated
urticaria and urticaria-and-angioedema phenotypes.

Release of histamine following mast cell degranulation plays a central role in the
development of signs and symptoms of CSU (11). Thus, H1-antihistamines have been the
standard care of CSU. However, it was shown that rate of response to standard doses of
antihistamines in CSU patients was 38.6% and increasing the dose of antihistamines were
likely to increase the response rate in up to 60% of the patients (12). Omalizumab, the first
humanized anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, has become the mainstay treatment option for the
antihistamine refractory patients in recent years. Although effectiveness of omalizumab in
CSU has been shown in several studies, there are still many unanswered questions on how to

manage omalizumab treatment in CSU. One of these questions is whether sgAHs should be

discontinued in cases where the disease is under control with omalizumab. In our previous
review, we discussed on this question despite most of our answers were based on expert
opinions (6). As far as we know, there is no study directly dealing with this subject. In their
recent study, Ensina et al performed a retrospective analysis and showed that over 24 months
treatment with omalizumab, 27.2% of the patients were able to stop taking sgAHs and their
urticaria were still continued to be controlled only with omalizumab monotherapy (7). They
also found that accompanying angioedema or response rate to omalizumab did not create a
difference in the use of sgAHs and proposed that sgAHs may be no longer necessary in some
patients once the disease is controlled with omalizumab. In another retrospective real-life
data, Andag et al also showed that it was possible to treat 33% of their study group with
omalizumab monotherapy without antihistamines (13). A review dealing with this subject
showed that omalizumab was effective without the need for concomitant sgAHs in up to 60%
of patients (5). It was shown that up to 70% complete response (UAS7=0 or UCT=16) rate
could be achieved with omalizumab treatment (4, 14) and it is clear that when complete
response was achieved with omalizumab, sgAHs may no longer be necessary. However, as in
our study, there is also a patient group that has well controlled urticaria but not complete
response (0<UAS7<6 or 16>UCT=12) with omalizumab. Our results showed that as the
disease control rate decreased during intervals, these patients used more sgAHs, and this asneeded sgAH intake was effective on suppressing urticarial symptoms, independent from the

presence of accompanying angioedema.

Another interesting finding of our study is that as-needed sgAHs were less effective in

patients with higher baseline total IgE levels. Over the past years, two endotypes of CSU were

postulated: type-I autoimmune (autoallergic) CSU and type IIb-autoimmune CSU (15).
Indirect line of evidence suggests that these two endotypes differ in their serum biomarker
profiles and response to treatments. Type-I autoimmune endotype have been suggested to
have higher baseline total IgE levels, have faster and higher rates of response to omalizumab
treatment and higher response rates to sgAHs (14-16). Similar to previous studies our
patients’ baseline total IgE levels were high (17), and we had a rapid and high response rate
with omalizumab in the first 3-months of treatment. Therefore, we believe majority of our
patient group consisted of type-I autoimmune endotype. It was reported that patients with type
I[b-autoimmune endotype, which were classified with indirect markers of type IIbautoimmune endotype like higher baseline CRP levels, lower blood basophil counts and
antinuclear antibodies positivity, were more likely to have resistance to antihistamines when
compared to type-I autoimmune endotype (18-20). Although it might seem to interfere with
our results, it would be inappropriate to compare our results with these findings since it is
important to note that previous findings reflect the antihistamine resistance prior to
omalizumab treatment. A possible explanation for the lower sgAH effectiveness in patients
with higher baseline total IgE levels may be that these patients had better symptomatic
improvement after omalizumab and had lower symptomatic scores before sgAHs, thus the
possible decrease with sgAH intake would be less. However we eliminated this possibility
since we found no such correlation between baseline total IgE levels and symptomatic scores
prior to sgAH or number of sgAH intake during the interval. Another hypothetical
explanation is that despite the significant suppression of mast cell degranulation, and

therefore, urticarial symptoms after omalizumab treatment, intermittent degranulation of mast

cells and histamine release still continues at a minimal level, and this time standard dose
sgAHs may be sufficient to block action of histamine and competes with it at receptor level.
However, we do not have any explanatory data on this subject and further studies

investigating the underlying mechanisms are needed.

Our study has some limitations. First is the low number of the patients enrolled in the
study. Secondly, we used UAS 7p to score symptoms before and after sgAH intake. Although
it has been modified for our study, we are aware that this patient reported outcome measure
(PROM) was not mainly validated for such purpose, but we had to use this tool since there
was no other PROM that was feasible for our study. Thirdly, we did not evaluate the possible
effects of sgAHs on angioedema in patients with urticaria-and-angioedema phenotype.
Although angioedema activity score (AAS) was a validated tool to determine disease activity
in recurrent angioedema patients (21), we did not use this PROM. Fourtly, since this was as
observational study, we did not change the antihistamines that have been already used by the
patient; which might have resulted in efficacy diversities between different sgAHs (22).
Therefore, it would be more appropriate to use the same agent in future studies. Lastly, it is
known that H1-antihistamines are inverse agonists and also have anti-inflammatory activities
(23). Although our study showed that as-needed sgAHs were effective in symptomatic
improvement, further studies are needed to investigate whether this inverse-agonist and antiinflammatory effects of sgAHs cause any significant difference between as-needed and daily

regimes. To answer this question, comparative studies are needed.

In conclusion, our study showed that in patients with well controlled urticaria under

omalizumab, as the UCT scores decreased during an interval, patients tended to use more as

needed sgAHs and these sgAHs had significantly decreased itch and hives scores. In addition,
we also found that baseline total IgE levels may be used as a potential biomarker for sgAH
effectiveness in patients under omalizumab treatment. We believe our findings may provide
guidance for individualized treatment planning and antihistamine management in CSU

patients under omalizumab treatment.
