Background: Urticaria and atopic dermatitis are representative allergic skin diseases that can be mediated by IgE.
Measuring levels of specific IgE can be used to confirm causative agents of these skin diseases. Objective: To analyze results from the multiple allergosorbent test chemiluminescent assay (MAST-CLA), which measures specific IgE in the
presence of a causative agent/allergen, in IgE-mediated skin
diseases. Methods: A total of 404 patients with urticaria,
atopic dermatitis or pruritus were enrolled in the present
study. Positive rates of specific IgE as well as total serum IgE
from the MAST-CLA were compared. Results: Positive rates
of specific IgE were highest in atopic dermatitis patients,
followed by urticaria, and then pruritus, with 57.0%, 37.1%,
and 20.8%, respectively (p <0.05). House dust mite species
were the most common allergens in both atopic dermatitis
and urticaria skin diseases. There were no differences in the
overall MAST-CLA results between acute and chronic
urticaria. The relative positive rate of inhalant allergen was
significantly higher in adult than in child atopic dermatitis
patients. Conclusion: Results from the MAST-CLA showed
diversity among the three disease groups, and within each
disease group, with different positive rates of specific IgE, a
different mean allergen number per patient, and so on.
Therefore, we concluded that MAST-CLA could be a useful
diagnostic tool for various allergic skin diseases. (Ann

INTRODUCTION

 

With allergic diseases (or allergies), knowing the relationship to specific or potential allergens is important to determine the best therapeutic intervention and subsequent
prevention. Diagnosing allergic diseases involves taking a
detailed medical and personal history, a physical examination, and either in vivo or in vitro testing for relevant
allergens. Although a skin prick test is the most widely
used method and is considered the gold standard for
determining specific antigen(s), it has several disadvantages, including a high percentage of false positives, antihistamine interference, and invasiveness. To circumvent
these disadvantages, various in vitro analyses, including
the radioallergosorbent test (RAST), Pharmacia CAP test
(CAP), and the multiple allergosorbent test chemiluminescent assay (MAST-CLA) were developed. MAST-CLA is a
simple method that can test for 35 common allergens
simultaneously, and thus it is suitable as a screening test.
Employing a very sensitive chemiluminescence technique,
MAST-CLA is safer than other methods that use a radioactive isotope. Also, MAST-CLA was reported to have a
relatively high sensitivity, specificity, and correlation rate
when compared with the skin prick test in previous studies’.

Currently, MAST-CLA is one of the most popular tools
used in the Republic of Korea to diagnose allergic skin
diseases, including atopic dermatitis and acute/chronic
urticaria. This laboratory test, measuring specific IgE, is
helpful in confirming causative agents of these diseases. In
the present study, we analyzed MAST-CLA results from
patients, who had visited the Department of Dermatology
at Boramae Hospital, and who were diagnosed with
atopic dermatitis, urticaria and pruritus. We analyzed the
results within each disease group according to different
epidemiological factors. Furthermore, we compared the
results among these three disease groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

 

We reviewed results from the MAST-CLA that had been
carried out between December 2005 and August 2007 at
the Department of Dermatology, Boramae Hospital. The
three most common diseases for which MAST-CLA was
prescribed were urticaria, atopic dermatitis, and pruritus.
A total of 404 patients, with these diseases, were enrolled.
Positive rates of specific IgE from the MAST-CLA results
were compared among the three disease groups.

Methods

1) Patient data

Age, sex, major symptom, diagnosis, and disease duration
were evaluated by reviewing patient’s medical records
retrospectively. Atopic dermatitis patients were divided
into children or adults group. Reflecting the recent
upward trend in the upper age limit of pediatric patients,
we defined a child as a person younger than 18 years of
age; this included neonates, infancy, adolescence, and
puberty. Urticaria patients were divided into an acute or
chronic group, by 6 weeks of disease duration - widely
used in many references.

2) MAST-CLA

Patient blood samples were checked by using the Korean
food panel of the MAST-CLA (MAST-Immunosystems,
Mountain View, CA, USA). This assay can simultaneously
measure 35 different specific IgE antibodies. Associated
allergens consisted of those from food, mold, pollen, as
well as inhalant allergens, all of which Korean people
show a positive reaction most frequently. The test
procedure was the method described in Kim et al.’. Class
2 or more was considered a positive reaction.

3) Statistical analysis

The statistical analysis was conducted with SPSS software
(SPSS v. 15.0). Using the chi- square test, positive rates of
specific IgE from the MAST- CLA were compared among
the different groups. ANOVA was used to compare
positive rates of each disease group for a specific allergen.

RESULTS
Distribution of the patients

 

Table 1 summarizes the clinical characteristics of the 404
patient subjects, with a disease distribution of 245 urticaria, 135 atopic dermatitis, and 24 pruritus patients.
Overall, subject ages ranged from 8 months to 76 years,
with a mean of 31.37 years. In the urticaria group, the
mean age was 37.45 years (1~55 years), with 109 males
and 136 females. Mean disease duration was 13.22
months; 112 were diagnosed with acute, and 133 with
chronic urticaria - persisting beyond 6 weeks. In the atopic
dermatitis group, the mean age was 13.41 years (8 months
~52 years); 93 were children under the age of 18 years,
and 42 were adults. Of these, 71 were male, and 64 were
female. Mean disease duration was 13.2 months (1 day ~
20 years).

Positive rates of specific IgE

Positive rates of specific IgE (number of patients who
showed a positive reaction for one or more specific
allergens out of the total number of patients) were
significantly different among the three disease groups. In
atopic dermatitis patients, 77 out of 135 showed a positive
reaction with a positive rate of 57.0%. In urticaria
patients, 91 of 245 showed a positive reaction with a
positive rate of 37.1%. In pruritus patients, 5 of 24
showed a positive reaction with a positive rate of 20.8%
(Fig. 1). The mean allergen number per patient, who
showed a positive reaction, was highest at 4.0 in the
atopic dermatitis group, followed by 3.3 in the urticaria
group, and 2.4 in the pruritus group.

Analysis of MAST-CLA Results as a Diagnostic Tool in Allergic Skin Diseases

In atopic dermatitis

As mentioned above, the positive rate of specific IgE in
atopic dermatitis was 57%. We analyzed this positive rate
of specific IgE in atopic dermatitis patients according to
different clinical characteristics and conditions.

1) Positive rates and personal/family history

A personal history (PHx) whether the patients had other
atopic diseases was mentioned in 96 of a total 245 atopic
atients. Among these 96 patients, 34 patients (35.4%)
had other atopic diseases. Twenty-one patients (21.9%)
had allergic rhinitis, 10 patients (10.4%) had urticaria, and
3 patients (3.1%) had asthma. Positive rate of specific IgE
was significantly higher in PHx (+) patients at 65.2% than
in PHx (—) patients at 49.4% (p< 0.05).

Existence of family history (FHx) of atopic dermatitis was
recorded in 54 patients. Among them, 22 patients (40.7%)
had a FHx of atopic dermatitis. Positive rate of specific IgE
was higher in the FHx (+) group at 68.5% than in the FHx
(—) group at 52.5% (p<0.05).

2) Positive rates and age

In atopic dermatitis, we compared the results of children
(age under 18 years) with adult patients. Positive rate of
specific IgE in the adult group was higher than in the child
group (64.3% vs. 52.7%), with a statistical significance (p
<0.05). Mean allergen number per patient, of those who

showed a positive reaction, was higher in the adult group
than in the child group (6.7 vs. 2.3). Table 2 shows the
number of positive specific IgE in adult and child atopic
dermatitis patients.

3) Common allergens

Table 3 shows common allergens in atopic dermatitis. In
general, the most common allergen in atopic dermatitis
was Dermatophagoides farinae (D. farinae) (43.0%), followed by Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (D. pteronyssinus) (40.0%) and house dust (25.2%). Shrimp (10.4%)
and cat (8.9%) were next. The five most common allergens in adults were identical to those of total atopic dermatitis patients. In children, although the first, second, and
third most common allergens were identical with total
atopic dermatitis, the fourth was beef, and the fifth was
cow's milk and crab. Among food allergens, the most
common was shrimp (10.4%); the second, crab (8.1%);
the third, baker’s yeast (6.7%); the fourth, beef (5.9%); and
the fifth, rice (5.2%).

Generally, a positive rate for inhalant allergens (48.9%)
was higher than that for food allergens (29.6%). A positive
rate for food allergens showed no significant difference
between adults and children (28.0% vs. 33.3% respectively). However, a positive rate for aeroallergen was higher
in adults (64.3%) than in children (41.9%), with p<0.05)
(Fig. 2).

In urticaria

1) Positive rates and acute/chronic

As mentioned above, a positive rate of specific IgE in
urticaria was 37.1%. There was no statistically significant
difference in positive rates of specific IgE between acute
and chronic urticaria (38.3% vs. 34.2%). Mean allergen
number per patient, of those who showed a positive
reaction did not show any significant difference, either

(data not shown).

2) Common allergens and acute/chronic

The three most common allergens of urticaria were
identical to those of atopic dermatitis, although the
positive rates in urticaria patients were significantly lower
than in atopic dermatitis patients. The first was D. farinae
(25.9%), the second was D. pteronyssinus (22.4%), and
the third, house dust (11.4%). Mugwort (5.7%) and
cockroach mix (5.3%) followed after house dust. No
allergen showed significantly different positive rates
between acute and chronic urticaria.

Specific allergens that showed different positive rates
between urticaria and atopic dermatitis were baker’s yeast
(p=0.000), beef (p=0.003), chicken (p=0.007), peanut
(p=0.014), rice (p =0.022), tuna (p =0.014), house dust (p
=0.000), D. farinae (p=0.000), D. pteronyssinus (p=
0.000), cow's milk (p=0.019), shrimp (p=0.029), and
alternaria (p=0.019). All values were higher in atopic
dermatitis.

 

In pruritus

Five (20.8%), of a total of 24, pruritus patients were positive for one or more specific allergens. The most common
allergens were house dust and Dermatophagoides, which
each of three patients had a positive reaction. However,
detailed analysis was not carried out in the pruritus group,
because the number of patients, who showed a positive
reaction for specific IgE, was too small.

DISCUSSION

 

There are several allergic skin diseases that can be mediated by IgE, and atopic dermatitis is one of them. It is a
chronic recurrent skin disease that usually occurs in children. Although the precise etiology of atopic dermatitis has
not been clarified, it is now widely accepted that serum
IgE has a key role in pathogenesis. Another representative
skin disease that can be mediated by IgE is urticaria. Urticaria is classified into immunologic and non-immunologic; in immunologic urticaria, lgE-mediated immune response is one of the main etiologic factors. Pruritus is
defined as a sensation that leads to a desire to scratch. It is
a predominant symptom for a varying number of skin
diseases, but it may also be a diagnostic term when it is
the only symptom in the absence of any specific skin
lesion. There are numerous causes of pruritus. A type 1
immune reaction can be one cause, especially when a
pruritic symptom appears several minutes to hours after
exposure to a causative agent. Laboratory tests that
measure specific IgE could be used to confirm causative
agents.

38 Ann Dermatol

In the present study, we measured specific IgE in urticaria,
atopic dermatitis, and pruritus patients using MAST-CLA,
and analyzed the results. A recent technique, the MASTCLA technology is a simple, practical and safe approach
for in vitro measurement in the diagnosis of allergic diseases. It can test simultaneously for 35 common allergens,
found in any environment, using a fluorescent antigenantibody reaction. We tried to analyze the MAST-CLA results within each of these three disease groups, and moreover, to compare the results among disease groups.
Although there are several prior studies that analyzed
specific IgE in atopic dermatitis using MAST-CLA*””’, few
have worked with two or more diseases, or have compared the results among and within various diseases as in
our study.

A positive rate of specific IgE was highest in atopic dermatitis (57.0%), followed by urticaria (37.1%) and pruritus
(20.8%) - with statistical significance. A positive rate in
atopic dermatitis and urticaria was in agreement with that
of previous studies in Korea’’. Mean allergen number per
patient of those who showed a positive reaction was
largest in atopic dermatitis (4.0), compared with urticaria
(3.3) and pruritus (2.4). Mean allergen number in atopic
dermatitis was similar to the results of a recent study in
orea’.
n atopic dermatitis patients, the positive rates were different according to the various epidemiological factors.

 

Patients who had a personal or family history of other
atopic diseases showed higher positive rates of specific IgE
than patients who had no histories. This correlates with
the well-known fact, patients who have a personal or

 

amily history of atopy show higher total and specific IgE°.
Comparing results of child and adult atopic patients,
positive rates of specific IgE were significantly higher in
adults (64.3%) than in children (52.7%). This is in accordance with the previous report by Kim et al.’ in which
positive rates of adult patients were significantly higher
than that of children (71.2% vs. 45.6%). In other previous
studies, there was an age-specific difference in positive
rates, generally low in children under 10 years, high in the
second and third decade of life, and decreasing after the
fifth decade*’. However, Tanei and Katsuoka’? reported
that 14 of 16 senile atopic patients, with a mean age of
76.9 years, showed a high positive rate of 87.5% for
antigen-specific IgE antibodies. Therefore, further evaluation for an age-specific positive rate of specific IgE in a
larger population is needed. Although the positive rates
between adults and children showed minimal difference
in this study, mean allergen number per patient, of those
who showed a positive reaction, was significantly higher
in adults than in children (6.7 vs. 2.3).
Analysis of MAST-CLA Results as a Diagnostic Tool in Allergic Skin Diseases

With respect to common allergens of atopic dermatitis, the
most prevalent was D. farinae, followed by D. pteronyssinus, and house dust, consecutively. This result is in
accordance with previous studies*””, although the precise
positive rates showed some discrepancies in each study.
This reconfirmed that the most common allergen in
allergic skin diseases is the house dust mite; D. farinae
and D. pteronyssinus are known to be main sources of
house dust allergens''’'?. These allergens are considered
to be the most important causative allergens in allergic
asthma and perennial rhinitis'”"*, and they also might be
an essential causative allergen in atopic dermatitis.
Teplitsky et al.'? reported that atopic dermatitis patients
showed a higher prevalence of mites, which could be involved in allergic sensitization and disease exacerbation,
on their skin than did healthy individuals. Furthermore,
repeated topical application of a crude extract of Dermatophagoides can induce atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions
in NC/Nga mice'®'”, Moreover, previous in vitro studies'®'?
demonstrated that house dust mites induce inflammatory
cytokines in human keratinocytes via enzyme activity or
gene expression. The fourth most common allergen was
shrimp, and the fifth, cat. Although the first through third
most common allergens were identical in previous studies, the fourth and the fifth were variable. In atopic dermatitis, Lee et al.’ reported that the fourth most common
allergen was cockroach mix, and the fifth, crab, whereas
Kim et al.’ reported that oak, rye and Aspergillus followed
after house dust allergens. The five most common
allergens in adults were identical with that of total atopic
dermatitis patients. However, in children, although the
irst, second, and third most common allergens were
identical with total atopic dermatitis, the fourth was beef,
and the fifth was cow’s milk and crab. Among food
allergens, the most common was shrimp, then crab,
‘ollowed by baker’s yeast, beef, and rice, consecutively.
The proportion of aeroallergen to food allergen was higher
in adults. Food allergy is a well-known aggravating factor
or atopic dermatitis, especially in moderate to severe
child atopic dermatitis patients”°. However, similar to the
resent study, patients showed higher positive reactions to
inhalant allergens rather than to food allergens as they
aged in previous studies®”'. This is possibly due to the fact
that most patients develop tolerance to some food allergens, whereas they get exposed to more new aeroallergens that can induce an allergic reaction over time. With
respect to just food allergens, children showed relatively
higher positive rates for milk and beef; on the other hand,
adults showed relatively higher positive rates for shrimp
and crab. These results are explained by the fact that milk
and beef are foods to which one is frequently exposed in

 

 

infancy, so that most develop tolerance; whereas, people
are exposed to crustaceans, such as crab or shrimp,
relatively later in life. Higher positive rates for crustacean
allergens in adults might be also explained by the fact that
the relative proportions of aeroallergen that cross-react
with crustacean is higher in adults. It has been described
that cockroach, shrimp and crab can cross react with
house dust mites via the tropomyosin allergen’*. Hence,
we have to be cautious when analyzing the results among
these kinds of allergens.

In urticaria, the first, second, and third most common
allergens were identical with that of atopic dermatitis,
while the fourth was mugwort, and the fifth was a
cockroach mix. Likewise, in atopic dermatitis, the first
through third most common allergens were identical in
previous studies, but the fourth and the fifth were variable.
The fourth most common allergen was shrimp in Miyamoto et al.'', whereas in Park et al.°, pollen, molds and
cockroach were the fourth, fifth and sixth respectively. In
our present study, mugwort in urticaria and cat in atopic
dermatitis were especially common allergens, apart from
house dust allergens, and those that can cross-react with
them.

In our study, there was no significant difference in the
positive rate of specific IgE between acute and chronic
urticaria. There was no specific allergen that showed
different positive rates between the two groups. These
results indicate that given enough time, a high percentage
of currently acute urticaria cases may become chronic.
Additionally, arbitrary categorization of urticaria into
acute or chronic, by a cutoff time of 6 weeks, could be
meaningless, as the causes may be identical. Urticaria is
commonly classified into acute and chronic disease on the
basis of the disease duration of 6 weeks. Some foods,
drugs, or infections are known to cause acute urticaria;
whereas, with chronic urticaria, it is difficult to find an
obvious cause, except in the case of physical urticaria. In
Lee et al.*, using MAST-CLA, D. farinae was the most
common (21.4%) allergen in chronic urticaria, followed
by D. pteronyssinus (21.4%), house dust (7.1%) and
shrimp (4.3%). This is consistent with the results of our
present study, although positive rates of house dust and
shrimp were higher in the current study. Similarly,
Caliskaner et al.’’ reported that the most common allergen
of chronic urticaria was the house dust mite (24.7%) - by
using a skin prick test. They also reported that house dust
mites were the only allergen that had a significantly
different positive rate between urticaria patients and
healthy controls. Moreover, the positive rate in urticaria
was lower than in atopic dermatitis, consistent in our
study.

Vol. 22, No. 4, 2010 39
JW Shin, et al

We measured and analyzed specific IgE for several allergic diseases using MAST-CLA. This study is meaningful, in
that we not only analyzed results within each disease
group, but we also compared across different and related
IgE-mediated diseases. We compared disease groups by
identical laboratory methods and conditions. Among the
previous studies mentioned above, discrepancies in
positive rates of specific IgE existed even though investigations involved the same disease. These discrepancies
might be caused by a disparity in subject populations or
different laboratory conditions. This present retrospective
study provides a cross-sectional analysis among three different diseases. Therefore, our results may assist clinicians in understanding etiology and determining causative
agents of particular diseases, which may share an
underlying mechanism. However, further investigation is
needed to elucidate to what degree these allergens induce
clinical symptoms in related diseases.
