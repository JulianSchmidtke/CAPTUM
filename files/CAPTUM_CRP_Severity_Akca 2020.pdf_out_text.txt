cant indicator of systemic inflammation. We investigated the potential correlation
between serum levels of hsCRP and N/L ratio, as well as urticaria activity, in CSU
patients. We included 52 CSU patients treated at the Dermatology Polyclinic of
Beysehir State Hospital between August and October 2020, and 50 controls. The
7-day UAS were graded mild, moderate, or intense. We measured N/L ratios, erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESRs), and the levels of hsCRP, 14, and thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) in each group. The anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TG) and
anti-microsomal antibody (anti-TPO) levels of CSU patients were also assayed. There
were no significant differences in hsCRP, T4, or TSH levels between the groups;
however, both the ESR and N/L ratio were significantly higher in CSU patients hsCRP
(P = .96), T4 (P = .07), TSH (P = .67), ESR (P < .001), N/L(P < .001). No correlation was
evident between the UAS day 7 (UAS7) score and the hsCRP level or the N/L ratio
(P = .528 and P = .387). Of all the CSU patients, 19.2% tested positive for anti-TPO
and 9.6% were positive for anti-TG; these data were not correlated with the UAS7
(P = 1 and P = .637). Inflammation plays a role in CSU. Although we did not find a correlation between the UAS and either the hsCRP level or the N/L ratio, the ESR and

N/L ratio were higher in CSU patients than in controls.

cytokines that stimulate hsCRP production (interleukin-6 and tumor
necrosis factor-a), and enzymes including matrix metalloproteinase-9
play pivotal roles in CU pathogenesis. Correlations between inflammatory indicators (such as the neutrophil/lymphocyte [N/L] ratio) and disease activity and prognosis have been defined in patients with various
dermatological diseases.** During the acute phase, the levels of these
inflammatory indicators correlate with the UAS and disease severity.>’”
We investigated the correlations between serum levels of hsCRP and

N/L ratio, as well as CSU disease activity.

2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS

We included 52 CSU patients aged 18 to 60 years treated at the Dermatology Polyclinic of Beysehir State Hospital between August and
October 2020, and a control group of 50 acne vulgaris patients
aged 18 to 55 years without any additional systemic disease. All
patients and controls signed consent forms stating that they had
been briefed on the study, and were then included. Patients with urticaria alone or urticaria/angioedema more than 6 weeks in duration
formed the CU group. We evaluated urticaria patients as suggested
by the EAACI/GA (2)/LEN/EDF/WAO? guideline; patients who
lacked inducible forms of urticaria were diagnosed with CSU. The
exclusion criteria were pregnancy, lactation, kidney or liver dysfunction, the use of medication to treat such conditions, a history of
systemic inflammatory disease, and/or systemic immunosuppressive
treatment within the prior month. We recorded age, sex, duration
of disease, medications taken, and any additional systemic disease.
The 7-day UAS (UAS7 scores) were graded mild, moderate, or intense
(Table 1).2 The Ethics Committee on Human Research of Aksaray
University approved the study (approval no. 2020/08-04 dated
31 August 2020).

2.1 | Laboratory results

Following an 8-hour fast, venous blood samples were assayed in terms
of the N/L ratio, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and the levels
of hsCRP, T4, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The levels of
anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TG) and anti-microsomal antibody (anti-TPO) in
CSU patients were also measured. Serum levels of hsCRP were determined via immunoturbidimetry (Roche/Hitachi Module, Mannheim,
Germany). TSH, anti-TG, and anti-TPO levels were determined using a
Roche/Hitachi Cobas 602 autoanalyzer.

2.2 | Statistical analyses

The data analyses were performed with SPSS Statistics Pack version
25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY). We calculated percentages and means, and
used the chi-square, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney U, and
Spearman correlation tests as appropriate. A P-value of <.05 was con
sidered to reflect statistical significance.

3 | RESULTS

Of the 52 CSU patients, 67.3% were female; the mean age of all
patients was 37.87 + 12.10 years. Of the 50 controls, 56% were
female; the mean age of all controls was 32.00 + 10.47 years (Table 2).

The ESR and N/L ratio were higher in CSU patients than in controls (P < .001) (Table 3).

The UAS7 scores indicated that 37 CSU patients had mild to
moderate disease and 15 had acute disease. The mean UAS7 score
was 21.27 + 13.00. The ESR was positively correlated with the N/L
ratio. The TSH and T4 levels were negatively correlated (Table 4).

4 | DISCUSSION

Urticaria can be clinically subgrouped into spontaneous and inducible
(physical) urticaria. If disease persists on every day over at least
6 weeks, CSU (spontaneous urticaria) is diagnosed; this is the most
common type that develops in the absence of any external stimulus.”
Overall, 15% to 25% of subjects experience at least one lifetime urticaria flare-up; 0.1% to 1% of such patients (often young adults aged
20-40 years; more commonly females) develop CU.1* The mean age
of our CSU patients was 37.87 years; 67.3% were female. These
demographic data are consistent with those of the literature. Both

the UAS and disease severity must be considered when treating

CSU patients, as must an etiology-oriented full blood count, hsCRP.
level, the ESR, and other patient-specific data.? The ESR reflects inflammatory activity and increases with age.2° One study reported an
increased ESR in patients with classic urticaria, although the increase
was not urticaria-specific.1t We found that the ESR was significantly
higher in CSU patients than in controls, perhaps because the mean age
of CSU patients was higher than that of controls. CSU features an
inflammatory, acute-phase skin response’; the circulatory hsCRP levels
change.!? We found that serum levels of hsCRP and the N/L ratio were
significantly higher in CSU patients than in controls. In some previous
studies, the mean serum level of hsCRP and the N/L ratio were significantly higher in CSU patients than in controls.1**4 In Aleem et al's
study, an increased CRP level was correlated with an enhanced systemic inflammatory response in CSU patients, although any role for
CRP in terms of urticaria pathogenesis remained unclear. However, the
CRP level reflected CSU activity. In contrast, Lu et al’® found no significant differences in the serum levels of hsCRP between CSU patients
and healthy volunteers, as in our study. Aktas Karabay et al’? did not
find a correlation between the N/L ratio and urticaria activity; we did
not find a correlation between hsCRP levels and N/L ratio or the UAS7

score (Table 5). Although the N/L ratio may not correlate directly with
disease activity, more data are required. Recent clinical and laboratory
research has found that autoimmune mechanisms play important roles
in the etiopathogeneses of 40% to 45% of CSU cases, although the
connections remain poorly understood.” Autoimmune thyroid disease in CSU patients has been extensively researched. The thyroid
autoantibody-positive rate ranges from 6.5% to 57%, and Hashimoto's
thyroiditis is particularly prevalent in urticaria patients.1®1? In one
study,2° 19% of CSU patients were anti-TPO positive, and at least one
of the relevant indicators was positive in 37 of 100 patients, 8% of
whom were anti-TG-positive. However, autoantibody levels did not
correlate with disease severity. We found that 19.2% of CSU patients

were anti-TPO-positive, and 9.6% were anti-TG-positive, but these

data did not correlate with the UAS7 score.

5 | CONCLUSION

It is known that CSU is correlated with inflammation. Our study
showed this correlation in line with the literature. We are of the opin
ion that further studies on wider populations are needed in order to

evaluate other factors that affect the urticaria activity.
