What is already known about this topic? The activation of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) on basophils and mast
cells is crucial for the immediate hypersensitivity responses in subjects with atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, and allergic

rhinitis.

What does this article add to our knowledge? Basophil FceRI expression is significantly upregulated in chronic

spontaneous and inducible urticaria. Patients who present negative autologous serum/plasma skin test, undetected levels
of antithyroid antibodies, or satisfactory clinical response to omalizumab exhibit higher FceRI levels.

How does this study impact current management guidelines? Although further multicenter studies are needed to
corroborate these findings, the assessment of basophil FceRI expression might be relevant in daily clinical practice
supporting an autoimmune pathogenesis and predicting response to anti-IgE treatment.

BACKGROUND: The high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI)
expression on effector cells has been poorly characterized in
patients with chronic urticaria (CU) to date.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the FceRI expression on blood
basophils in a large cohort of patients with CU and its potential
relationship with relevant features of the disease.

METHODS: Basophil FceRI expression was measured by flow
cytometry in 287 patients with CU (192 with chronic
spontaneous urticaria and 95 with chronic inducible urticaria) at
their initial evaluation in our department. A control group of
healthy nonatopic individuals was included to provide reference
data, and the effect of antihistamine and anti-IgE therapy on the

basophil FceRI expression was also evaluated in a cohort of
patients with CU.

RESULTS: The median FceRI expression was found significantly
higher in patients with CU compared with healthy controls
(P< .0001). A positive correlation was found between serum IgE
levels and basophil FceRI expression (R = 0.422; P < .001).
Significantly higher FceRI levels on basophils were detected in
patients with CU who presented with concomitant atopic
features (P = .003), negative autologous serum skin test

(P = .002), negative autologous plasma skin test (P = .009), or
undetected levels of antithyroid antibodies (P = 0.01). Baseline
FceRI expression was not related to the activity and duration of
the disease, and was not significantly modified during
antihistamine therapy; however, it correlated with the clinical
response to omalizumab (P = .003).

needed to corroborate these findings, the assessment of basophil
FceRI levels might be relevant in daily clinical practice

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common skin condition characterized by the recurrent appearance of itchy wheals and/or
angioedema for longer than 6 weeks.' It is classified into 2
subtypes: chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), when the lesions
occur without an obvious stimulus, and chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU), when symptoms are induced by different triggers,
for example, low temperatures, heat, pressure, or exercise.'”
Existing evidence demonstrates that CU symptoms may have

major detrimental effects on quality of life, including daily
activities and emotional well-being.”

The pathophysiology of CU involves the activation and
degranulation of effector cells, such as basophils and mast cells,
and the subsequent release of proinflammatory/pathologic
mediators that play a key role in the development of CU
symptoms.*” As of yet, it is unclear completely what causes such
activation and degranulation. One of the most attractive explanations in most of the patients is the autoimmune mechanism, in
which effector cells are activated by IgE or IgG through the highaffinity IgE receptor (FceRI) located on the surface of basophils,
mast cells, and antigen-presenting cells.°° Thereby, crosslinking
of FceRI with the complex IgE-autoantigen (type I autoimmunity) or with just IgG or the complex IgG-IgE (type Ib autoimmunity) would cause the activation/degranulation of effector
cells with the consequent release of preformed mediators and
newly synthetized active substances.”'”

Despite its supposed importance in the disease pathogenesis,
the FceRI expression on effector cells has been poorly characterized in patients with CU to date. Therefore, we sought to
investigate the FceRI expression on blood basophils in a large
cohort of patients with CSU and ClndU to answer the following
questions: (1) Are basophil FceRI levels increased in patients
with CU? (2) Are there clinical features that modulate the FceRI
expression in patients with CSU or CIndU? (3) Is the FceRI
expression modified during treatment in patients with CU? and
more important, (4) Is the assessment of the FceRI expression
relevant in daily clinical practice?

 

 

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Subjects and study design

This prospective study included patients with CSU or CIndU
referred to the Urticaria Clinic of the Department of Dermatology of
Hospital del Mar (Barcelona) during the period from January 2014
to June 2018 (ethical approval no. 2012/4913/I). After a systematized clinical protocol, a thorough and structured history (including
age, sex, disease duration, disease severity, personal history of atopic
features [ie, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and/or allergic
asthma], presence of angioedema, and concomitant subtypes of CU)
and laboratory analyses (including total serum IgE levels, thyroid
function, and levels of antithyroid antibodies [ATAs]: antithyroid

peroxidase [anti-TPO] and antithyroglobulin [anti-Tg]) were performed in all patients at the initial evaluation. In addition, autologous serum skin test (ASST), autologous plasma skin test (APST),
and/or standardized inducible testing were performed (when
appropriate) as part of the routine study protocol. CIndU diagnosis
was based on the patients’ clinical history and the results of standardized provocation testing.” As the main objective of the present
investigation, peripheral blood samples were obtained from patients
with CU to measure the FceRI expression on basophils by flow
cytometry. To avoid potential interferences, patients who were under treatment with biologic therapies (including omalizumab), oral
corticosteroids, and/or other immunosuppressive agents were
excluded from the study. Blood samples from a group of healthy
controls [HCs] without a family and personal history of CU or
atopic features were also evaluated to obtain reference data.

n addition, FceRI levels were assessed in a cohort of patients with
CU at different time points to investigate the effect of antihistamine
and anti-IgE therapy on the basophil FceRI expression. For antihistamine treatment, FceRI levels were measured at the baseline

 

evaluation and at least 1 month after the initiation of therapy
(nonsedating H1-antihistamines, doses ranging from | to 4 times the
recommended dose depending on the patient’s symptoms severity).
Response to therapy was defined as an improvement in the patients’
signs and symptoms achieving a 7-day urticaria activity score (UAS7,
a composite score of itch severity and hive count over 7 days; range,
0-42) <6 and/or an Urticaria Control Test (UCT, a validated tool
for assessing disease control in daily practice; range, 0-16) > ig
On the other hand, as the effect of omalizumab on the FceRI

 

expression in patients with CSU has been extensively studied in

recent investigations, '~"'> we have focused on the analysis of the
kinetic of FceRI levels during anti-IgE therapy in patients diagnosed
with pure CIndU. Thus, the FceRI expression was evaluated in
patients with ClndU who showed unsatisfactory response to antihistamines and were therefore treated with subcutaneous injections
of omalizumab 300 mg monthly. Basophil FceRI levels were
measured on day 0 and on weeks 4, 8, and 20 of treatment (ie,
before the Ist, 2nd, 3rd, and 6th injections), and response to therapy

was evaluated at 6 months of treatment according to the UCT score.

 

Most primary endpoints of the study (eg, evaluate the basophil
FceRI expression as a potential biomarker of disease activity, disease
duration, therapeutic response, and for confirming CSU and
distinguishing it from HCs) were prespecified at the initiation of the
investigation. Nevertheless, some observations, such as the FceRIIgE correlation and the differences in FceRI expression regarding the
“autoimmune” condition in patients with CSU, were evaluated after
the data collection was completed.

Basophil cell preparation and flow cytometry for the
FceRI expression

Flow cytometry analysis was performed following standard
procedures. '* Briefly, 150 [LL of anticoagulated blood was incubated
on the same day of collection during 20 minutes at 4°C with an
excess of human immunoglobulins to block unspecific binding.
Afterward, blood was stained with anti-CD123-PE (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, Calif) and anti-CD193-APC (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH,
Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) to identify basophils and with antiFceRla-FITC (clone CRAI; eBioscience, San Diego, Calif) or an
isotype control to establish the expression of FceRI on the surface of
blood basophils. It should be taken into account that, after fine
tuning the technique and evaluating the FceRI expression using

separately anti-CD123-PE and anti-CD193-APC markers, similar

basophil FceRI levels were observed in terms of mean fluorescence
intensity (MFI; Figure E1, available in this article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org); however, both antibodies were
simultaneously used to avoid FceRI positive dendritic cells. The
samples were then lysed and fixed using the FACS Lysing Solution
(BD Biosciences) and analyzed by flow cytometry in a FACSCanto
using the FACSDiva software. At least 2 x 10° events were acquired.
Levels of the basophil FceRI receptor were expressed as MFI. Instrument settings (eg, scatter and voltage settings and compensation
matrix) and experimental conditions (eg, antibody clones and dilution) remained constant for all samples throughout the study. To
ensure consistency in the analysis, the same investigator processed

 

and analyzed all samples and 2 independent researchers correlated
the levels of basophil FceRI expression and the clinical scores.

Serum IgE levels, levels of ATAs, and ASST/APST
Total IgE and levels of circulating anti-TPO and anti-Tg antibodies were analyzed in serum by a chemiluminescence immunoassay technique using the IMMULITE 2000 XPi System (Siemens,
Munich, Germany). The ASST was performed in patients with CSU
as previously described.'* Briefly, venous blood was taken at the
initial evaluation, and samples were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10
minutes and the serum was separated. For the APST, citrated blood
was centrifuged at room temperature to separate the plasma. Afterward, patients received intradermal injections of 50 ML of fresh
undiluted autologous serum and 50 [LL of autologous plasma on the
volar forearm. Similar volumes of 0.9% NaCl saline and 100 mg/mL
histamine were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. A
positive ASST/APST was considered when the diameter of seruminduced wheal was >1.5 mm compared with the saline-induced
response at 30 minutes.

Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were performed for each variable, using
median, range, and percentiles 25th (P25) and 75th (P75) for

quantitative variables, and absolute (n) and relative (%) frequencies

 

for categorical variables. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to
compare the FceRI receptor expression between patients with CSU,
ClIndU, and HCs. Pearson’s correlation was used to evaluate the
association of the FceRI receptor expression with serum IgE levels,
blood basophil count, disease duration, and scores of disease severity.
The paired samples test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used
to evaluate changes in FceRI levels during treatment with antihistamines and omalizumab, respectively. All analyses were carried out
with the SPSS 22.0 statistical package, and a P value < .05 was
considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Demographics and FceRI expression in the study
population

During the study period, 287 patients with CU were referred
to our clinic and were therefore included in the analysis. Of
these, 192 (66.9%) patients suffered from CSU predominantly
and the remaining 95 (33.1%) from pure CIndU (54 cold urticaria, 15 symptomatic dermographism, 10 solar urticaria, 7
cholinergic urticaria, 7 delayed pressure urticaria, 1 contact urticaria, and 1 aquagenic urticaria). In addition, 46 HCs were
included to obtain reference data. Clinical and demographics
eatures of the study population are summarized in Table I.

Regarding basophil FceRI levels, the median (P25-P75) FceRI
expression was found significantly higher in patients with CU
compared with HCs (9033 [5864-13,630] of MFI vs 4743
2771-7580] of MFI, respectively; P < .0001; Figure 1).
However, among patients with CU, no significant differences
regarding the FceRI expression were found in patients with CSU
compared with those with pure CIndU (9234 [5934-13,534] of
MFI vs 8932 [5566-13,919] of MFI, respectively; P = .826;
Figure 1). It should also be mentioned that no significant dif
erences were observed regarding total serum IgE levels and
basophil count between these 2 groups of patients (CSU vs pure

lower blood basophil numbers than HCs (P = .005).

FceRI

variables
Some clinical and laboratory variables had significant associ
expression and clinical and _ laboratory

ation with the basophil FceRI expression in our cohort of patients with CU. Thus, subjects who presented with concomitant
atopic features showed significantly higher FceRI levels than
those without a personal history of atopic dermatitis, allergic
rhinitis, and/or allergic asthma (median [P25-P75] FceRI
expression: 11,534 [6561-15,649] of MFI vs 8583 [543813,109] of MFI, respectively; P = .003). Likewise, higher
basophil FceRI levels were detected in patients with CSU with
negative ASST compared with those with positive ASST (median
[P25-P75] FceRI expression: 10,684 [7352-16,150] of MFI vs
8061 [1301-12,726] of MFI, respectively; P = .002; Figure 2). A
similar trend was found regarding the APST result (median
[P25-P75] FceRI expression: 10,403 [6992-15,515] of MFI in
APST negative patients vs 7903 [1243-13,601] of MFI in APST
positive patients; P = .009; Figure 2). The FceRI expression also
differed among patients with CU depending on the levels of
circulating ATAs, with lower FceRI levels in patients with
elevated ATA levels (ie, >35 UI/mL of anti-TPO and/or >40
Ul/mL of anti-T'g; median [P25-P75] FceRI expression: 6442
(1621-11,141] of MFI vs 9396 [6261-13,793] of MFI;
P= .010; Figure 2).

 

 

 

 

 

 

We also investigated whether the basophil FceRI expression in
patients with CU could be associated with total serum IgE levels
and/or blood basophil count. A positive correlation was found
between IgE levels and the FceRI expression (R = 0.422;
P < .001; Figure 3). Conversely, no association was detected
between blood basophil count and FceRI levels (R = 0.095;
P= 5132)¢

FceRI expression and disease activity and duration

Disease activity was evaluated by using the UAS7 in patients
with CSU and appropriate threshold tests in patients with
ClIndU (eg, the critical temperature threshold [CTT] and the
critical stimulation time threshold [CsTT] assessed by the
TempTest 3.0 in patients with cold urticaria).!”'” In this case,
the basophil FceRI expression was not found associated with
disease activity in patients with CSU (R = 0.114; P = .156), or
with the CTT (R = 0.062; P = .708) and the CsTT (R = 0.010;
P = .953) in patients with cold urticaria. Regarding CU prognosis, disease duration, defined as the time from symptoms onset
to the initial evaluation, was also not found associated with the
basophil FceRI expression in patients with CU (R = 0.031;
P= 613).

FceRI expression and therapeutic response

FceRI levels were evaluated in 60 subjects (47 CSU and 13
ClIndU) during antihistamine therapy (median [range] number
of months on therapy before follow-up measurement: 3 [1-21]
months). In this group of patients, the FceRI expression was

not significantly modified during treatment (P = .118; Figure 4,
A). Furthermore, no significant differences were observed
regarding the baseline FceRI expression in responders and nonresponders to antihistamines (P = .787). On the other hand, in
the 14 patients diagnosed with pure CIndU who received
treatment with omalizumab (9 cold urticaria, 3 solar urticaria,
and 2 symptomatic dermographism), a significant drop in the
basophil FceRI expression was observed after the first injection
(median [P25-P75] reduction from baseline at 4 weeks: 86.4%
[83.7-93.6]; P = .003; Figure 4, B), and such reduction was
maintained throughout the whole treatment (median reduction
from baseline at weeks 8 and 20: 90.3% and 88.0%, respectively). At 6 months of anti-IgE therapy, 11 (78.6%) patients
achieved significant clinical improvement (UCT > 12), whereas
3 (21.4%) subjects were considered to have poorly controlled
disease (UCT < 12). Interestingly, these omalizumab “nonresponders” showed very low baseline FceRI levels (median
[range] FceRI expression: 2547 [1172-3778] of MFI in “nonresponders” vs 13,591 [7982-18,512] of MFI in “responders”).

DISCUSSION

FceRI is a molecular complex expressed on the surface of mast
cells, basophils, antigen-presenting cells, and eosinophils, and its
activation appears to be critical for the immediate hypersensitivity response that is characteristic of allergic diseases.'®
Thereby, the FceRI expression has been found significantly
upregulated in subjects with atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma,
and allergic rhinitis compared with healthy nonatopic
individuals.'”7° Likewise, the results obtained from the present
large cohort study demonstrate that the FceRI expression on
circulating basophils is also substantially increased in patients
with active CSU and ClIndU. Although the exact functional
significance of elevated FceRI expression on effector cells in
allergic conditions is not completely understood, accumulated
evidence suggests that these receptors could enhance their roles as
effector cells in allergic inflammation.'? It has also been postulated that the elevated FceRI expression might profoundly alter
the spectrum of allergen-presenting cells available to present
allergens to T cel Is,°° and that FceRI downregulation may be

 

 

followed by an increase in the threshold above which degranulation of effector cells is triggered.'” Taken together, our observations support the involvement of FceRI on the complex
inflammatory response that occurs in patients with CSU and
ClIndU, and also support the assumption that circulating basophils play an important role in the pathophysiology of CU.
Several lines of evidence also support a regulatory role for
serum IgE in the expression of its high-affinity receptor on
human mast cells and basophils." Thereby, a very strong association (correlation coefficient close to 1) has been found
between serum IgE levels and FceRI expression on effector cells
in a great variety of disease states, particularly in atopic individuals, but also in other IgE-driven conditions like hyper-IgE
syndrome or helminth infestation.'”°* Although the basis for
this correlation has not been elucidated in detail, it has been
suggested either that there are similar regulatory mechanisms to
both IgE levels and IgE receptor or that IgE itself upregulates or
stabilizes surface expression of the receptor leading to elevated
expression in allergic diseases.*! However, such association has
not been previously evaluated in patients with CSU and CIndU.
According to our results, in these conditions, which are not
considered classic allergen-driven diseases, this potential association IgE-FceRI expression seems to be weaker (R = 0.422),
suggesting that there must be other regulatory mechanisms with
a significant influence on the FceRI levels in patients with CU.
In addition, it does not appear that certain CU features, such as
the activity/severity or the duration of the disease, may play an
important role in the regulation of the FceRI expression on
effector cells.
Previous studies have indicated that approximately 30% to
60% of patients with CU may have an autoimmune etiology on
the basis of various pieces of laboratory and clinical evidence.°”** Such autoimmune background is supported by the
identification of circulating autoantibodies against FceRI or (less
commonly) IgE that may induce activation of basophils and mast
cells, secretion of histamine, and recruitment of inflammatory
cells.°°* The detection of such autoantibodies may have a
complex methodology with variable sensitivity and specificity
and, as of yet, is not fully implemented in routine clinical
practice.”* Accordingly, several tests have been proposed to

 
J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT
VOLUME Mf, NUMBER

evaluate such autoimmune mechanism in patients with CU.
Among them, 2 of the most accessible and used in daily practice
are the ASST/APST and the detection of circulating ATAs,
because accumulated evidence demonstrates that autoantibodies
to FceRI are more frequently identified in patients with positive
ASST and/or elevated ATA levels,” which may be in line with
our findings. Thus, according to our results, patients with
negative ASST/APST or undetected ATAs showed significantly
higher basophil FceRI levels, suggesting that these autoantibodies
against FceRI (or other functional autoantibodies that bind to
the FceRI receptor) that are presumably present in patients with
autoimmune CU could interfere in the measurement of the
basophil FceRI expression, reducing their levels detected by flow
cytometry. Thereby, although there was an overlap of values
between both groups of patients, it could be said that the
assessment of the basophil FceRI expression may help distinguishing CU individuals according to the potential pathogenic
mechanism of their disease. These observations could have
important implications for clinicians, because patients with CU
with an autoimmune etiology may present distinctive clinical
features and patterns of therapeutic response.°** Further
research is needed to see whether the FceRI measurement can
distinguish autoimmune patients without this overlap.

Given the emergence of new therapies in CU, there is a
growing interest to look for objective biomarkers that reliably
predict the effectiveness of a specific therapeutic intervention.
Thus, many clinical and laboratory parameters have been claimed
to correlate with the response to therapy in CU during the last
years.”** ° However, there are no validated biomarkers in clinical
practice for this disease to date. In the particular case of omalizumab, previous data from our group and Metz et al demonstrated that the fast clinical improvement achieved during
omalizumab therapy in patients with CSU is associated with a
rapid and sharp reduction in the FceRI expression on effector
cells that is maintained throughout the whole treatment.'”!?”!
Furthermore, recent investigations have shown that patients
with CSU who do not respond to omalizumab therapy have
lower baseline FceRI levels on basophils compared with
responder patients, >? suggesting that this biomarker may
represent a potential predictor of omalizumab response in CSU.
Similarly, in the present study, we have observed that this trend
can also be applied in patients with CIndU, because nonresponders to omalizumab showed almost undetectable baseline
FceRI levels. The reason why these patients show very low
basophil FceRI expression is not yet fully understood. Genetic
variability or some masquerading factors could be plausible
explanations, because previous studies have shown that experimental molecular changes in the subunits of this receptor can
affect its expression on the cell surface.*? Although further
multicenter prospective studies are needed to confirm such
observations, these findings might have an important impact in
daily practice, allowing physicians to early identify patients who
will not benefit from omalizumab therapy.

Regarding antihistamines, previous data have also suggested
the existence of a possible link between certain aspects related to
the IgE receptor and the response to this treatment in patients
with CU. Thus, for example, Guo et al identified a single
nucleotide polymorphism in the FCERIA gene (a gene that
encodes the @-chain of the FceRI) that might be associated with
the therapeutic efficacy of nonsedating antihistamines in Chinese
patients with CSU. However, to our knowledge, the effect of

 

 

 

 

 

 

DEZAETAL 7

antihistamine therapy on the FceRI expression has not been
previously evaluated. In this sense, we could not find an association between FceRI levels and response to antihistamine
therapy in our cohort of patients with CU, because the basophil
FceRI expression was not significantly modified during treatment
and no differences regarding this parameter were observed
between responder and nonresponder patients.

Some limitations of the present study should be pointed out.
The analysis was done based on data from real clinical practice,
and therefore, some comparisons may not have reached statistical
significance probably due to a small sample size and insignificant
power to show statistical differences (a prior sample calculation
was not addressed). A matching procedure for some variables (eg,
age and sex) was not used for the selection of the control group.
The overlap of 25 to 75 ranges between ASST/APST positive
(autoimmune) and negative patients, even though the median
values were significantly different, may limit the blood basophil
FceRI expression clinical relevance. Further studies in larger
patient populations are needed to see how distinct the 2 populations are, to determine the amount of overlap, and to establish
a cutoff value for the FceRI expression that might provide an
optimal sensitivity and specificity. Although the evolution of the

 

basophil FceRI expression appears to be similar as in patients
with CSU, the limited number of patients with CIndU treated
with omalizumab in the present study does not allow drawing
firm conclusions about the baseline FceRI expression as a
biomarker of omalizumab response.

In summary, the FceRI expression on blood basophils is
significantly upregulated in subjects with CSU and CIndU
compared with healthy nonatopic individuals. The association
between serum total IgE levels and basophil FceRI expression in

 

CU is weaker than in other classic allergic diseases, suggesting
that there must be other regulatory mechanisms with an
important influence on the FceRI levels in this disease.
Furthermore, significantly higher FceRI levels might be detected
in patients with CU who present with concomitant atopic features, negative ASST/APST, or undetected levels of ATAs.
Although the FceRI expression would not provide information
regarding CU activity and prognosis, its assessment might be
relevant in daily clinical practice, helping physicians to identify
those patients with the suggested autoimmune pathogenesis
(driven by IgE or IgG autoantibodies against FceRI). More
extensive studies would be useful to confirm this observation and
to define the clinical value of FceRI expression in blood basophils
as a potential biomarker of omalizumab response.
