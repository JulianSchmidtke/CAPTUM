Plasma D-dimer levels and clinical response to
ciclosporin in severe chronic spontaneous
urticaria

To the Editor:

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a skin disorder characterized by
the continuous or intermittent eruption of short-lived wheals,
sometimes associated with angioedema, for more than 6 weeks.
Second-generation H1 antihistamines are able to control the
disease in most cases, but a significant proportion of patients do
not respond, show a heavily impaired quality of life,! and pose a
challenge for the physician. Severe CU is frequently characterized
by an increase in plasmatic markers of thrombin generation and
fibrinolysis,” * possibly as a consequence of tissue factor expression by activated eosinophils.*° The activation of coagulation
and fibrinolysis decreases until complete normalization during
remission.’ Recent studies found that elevated D-dimer plasma
levels might be considered a marker of antihistamine-resistant
CU.° Omalizumab proved effective in a large proportion of patients with antihistamine-resistant, severe cases of CU but is still
unavailable in many settings including this one, whereas
ciclosporin is much more easily available and its efficacy, known
for many years, is supported by both case series and controlled
trials.” The present study investigated the behavior of D-dimer
plasma levels in patients with severe CU undergoing ciclosporin
therapy. The study investigated 29 patients (men/women, 9/20;

mean age, 46 years; range, 11-75 years) with severe,
antihistamine-resistant CU seen during the last 4 years. Patients
showed a mean disease duration of 34.0 + 44.9 months (range,
3-150 months) and a mean urticaria activity score of 4.3 + 0.5
(range, 4-5). All patients had not responded to different types of
second-generation antihistamines given at up to 3X the licensed
dose for weeks, and had been treated with short oral prednisone
courses as previously reported'” but relapsed as soon as the doses
were tapered down or the drug stopped. In the absence of
omalizumab, it was eventually decided to try ciclosporin at a
dose of 3 to 5 mg/kg/day (about 4 mg/kg/day in most cases), for
a minimum of 3 months, as suggested by previous studies.”*
Plasma D-dimer levels (expressed in ng/mL) were measured by using ELISA before the start of ciclosporin and in 11 cases also during and/or at the end of the treatment. Measurements were carried
out in different laboratories scattered throughout this area. Because
of the existence of various cutoffs (200, 243, 280, 500, 550, and
570 ng/mL, respectively) as a consequence of differences in standardization between the various producers of the assay kits, plasma
levels were “normalized” (proportionally recalculated) to a cutoff
of 500 ng/mL to provide a univocal minimum value above which
D-dimer levels were considered elevated. Normal D-dimer values
were recorded as less than 500 ng/mL, and analyzed as 500 ng/mL
in the statistics. Thyroid autoantibodies (TAs), C-reactive protein
(CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were measured
at baseline as well. To perform the statistical analyses, the clinical

response to ciclosporin (either immediate or in the long term) was
arbitrarily assigned a score as follows:

e@ None: No change in CU severity under ciclosporin treatment
(score 0).

Partial: Some benefit, but pruritus and wheals still present
and requiring antihistamine treatment at higher than licensed
doses and/or low-dose prednisone (score 1).

Good: 50% to 80% reduction in pruritus and wheals under antihistamines at licensed dose (score 2).

Excellent: complete absence of pruritus and wheals taking antihistamines at licensed dose (score 3).

Remission: complete disappearance of pruritus and wheals
without taking antihistamines (score 4).

All clinical investigations were carried out according to the
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki; all patients gave their
informed consent to both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
Because the study was based on data stemming from routine
clinical activity, approval by an ethics committee was not
needed.

Table I presents the clinical features of patients and their
response to ciclosporin. TAs were detected in 11 of 28 (39%)
patients, and CRP and ESR levels were elevated in 5 of 27
(11%) and 2 of 28 (3%) patients, respectively. Baseline D-dimer
plasma levels were elevated in 18 of 29 (62%) patients.
Ciclosporin treatment was successful (grade 4 or 3 response) in
17 (59%) patients, partially successful (grade 2 or 1) in 8 (28%)
patients, and failed (grade 0) in 4 (14%) patients. In 6 patients,
a successful treatment was followed by a relapse after the
treatment was stopped. Although in most ciclosporin responders
the benefit was rapidly apparent (a marked reduction in the
urticaria activity score 3-7 days after starting the drug), in 2 cases
the response was eventually good but very slow, appearing only
after 1 or 2 months of treatment, respectively. TAs, elevated
CRP levels, elevated ESR levels, age, disease duration, and sex
were not associated with the clinical response to ciclosporin
(scores 0-4) (Mantel-Haenszel test of trend and Kendall rank
correlation). In contrast, baseline D-dimer levels showed a highly
significant negative correlation with the response to ciclosporin
(7 —0.44; P < .017; Kendall rank correlation coefficient
assigning a value of 500 to normal D-dimer levels); furthermore,
10 of 11 (91%) patients with normal D-dimer plasma levels versus
7 of 18 (39%) patients with elevated D-dimer plasma levels
showed a completely successful response to the treatment (Fisher

exact test; P = .008). Table II presents D-dimer level trends in 11
patients in whom at least 1 follow-up measurement was
performed after starting ciclosporin. In most cases (patient
number 2, 4, 10, 14, 21, 24, 27, and 29), D-dimer levels appeared
to follow the positive or negative clinical response to the
treatment, whereas in other patients (3 and 19) the D-dimer level
remained slightly elevated despite an excellent clinical response
(Table ID). Interestingly, in patient no. 3, D-dimer levels showed
a marked tendency to increase when ciclosporin doses were
tapered down, possibly suggesting the persistence of the underlying inflammatory process despite the excellent clinical response.
In 1 patient, D-dimer levels remained normal throughout the
follow-up period.

The activation of coagulation/fibrinolysis parallels disease
activity in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria’*
although whether such activation participates in the pathogenesis of the disease is still unclear. The fact that several previous
studies found that anticoagulant therapy (by either oral anticoagulants or heparin) is extremely effective in some cases seems
to support a pathogenic role, at least in selected patients. In the
present study, baseline D-dimer plasma levels were elevated in
more than 60% of the patients; this observation is not surprising
because the patients studied here represented a minority of subjects with CU with a particularly severe disease, unresponsive to
standard treatments. Nonetheless, D-dimer levels followed the
clinical response to ciclosporin treatment in most of the
followed-up patients. The rate of clinical response to ciclosporin
treatment was extremely good, similar to that observed in
previous studies (7-9). Altogether, although the data used in
the present study stem from routine clinical care and lack
the rigor associated with a clinical research study, these
observations confirm that D-dimer is a good marker of disease
activity in most patients with spontaneous CU, and show that
such parameter may also be useful to monitor the clinical
response to ciclosporin treatment in most patients with severe
disease.
