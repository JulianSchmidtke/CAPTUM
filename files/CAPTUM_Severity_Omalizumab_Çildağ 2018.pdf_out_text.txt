Introduction: Suppression of free immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels and an increase in total IgE levels are observed during omalizumab treatment. However, whether omalizumab has any effect on other immunoglobulins is unknown.
Aim: To investigate the effect of omalizumab treatment on serum IgE and other immunoglobulins, and demonstrate
any association with response to treatment in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU).

Material and methods: The study included 41 patients diagnosed with CSU. Baseline and post-12-week-treatment
total IgE, IgA, IgM, and IgG levels and blood eosinophil, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet levels were compared.
Patients were grouped based on weekly urticaria activity score (UAS-7) responses and these parameters were

compared.

Results: There was a significant increase in baseline and post-12-week-treatment total IgE levels, while there was
no significant difference in other immunoglobulin levels. A significant reduction was found in neutrophil counts
after the treatment, whereas there was no significant difference in eosinophil, lymphocyte and platelet levels. There
was no difference in these parameters between groups with complete response and without complete response.

Conclusions: Omalizumab treatment can also be used in patients with immunoglobulin deficiency. Due to the
observed reduction in neutrophil counts after the treatment, patients must be closely followed for whole blood

parameters.

Key words: chronic urticaria, immunoglobulin, omalizumab.

ined by the prolongation of the half
life of IgE, which has a half-life of 2-3 days, by binding

to omalizumab of

gG1 structure, which has a half-life of

26 days [4, 5]. An increase in total IgE levels is known to

Omalizumab is a human monoclonal antibody in the
form of IgG1 which is designed against IgE. Omalizumab
blocks the binding of IgE to FceRI on the surface of mast
cells and basophils by binding free IgE from Fce3 fragments [2]. Thereby, FceRI on the surface of basophils
and mast cells undergo downregulation. Omalizumab

A decrease in inflammatory mediators with omalizumab in allergic diseases requires a 95% reduction in
IgE levels [6, 7]. Therefore, an omalizumab dose in patients with asthma is determined based on lgE level
and body weight [8]. However, since CSU is not a classic
allergen-driven disease, a fixed dose of omalizumab is
used [9-11].

The effect of omalizumab treatment on IgE and other immunoglobulin levels in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria

and its association with treatment response

 

The effect of omalizumab treatment on total serum
IgE levels is well-known. However, we did not find any
studies demonstrating the effect on other immunoglobulins.

Aim

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of
omalizumab treatment on peripheral blood IgE and other
immunoglobulins and demonstrate any association with
response to treatment.

Material and methods

We retrospectively analyzed 41 patients who started
omalizumab treatment for refractory CSU. For this study,
an approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee for
Non-invasive Clinical Studies at the Adnan Menderes University School of Medicine (No. 2017/1083). The subcutaneous omalizumab dose administered to the patients was
300 mg once a month. Total IgE, A, M, G, disease activity
by using the weekly urticaria activity score (UAS-7) pretreatment (baseline) and post-12-week treatment with
omalizumab, were recorded. Also blood neutrophil, lymphocyte, eosinophil and platelet counts were recorded.

The UAS-7 is a calculated patient reported outcome
measure derived by summing the score for the number
of wheals and intensity of pruritus (0: none, 1: mild,
2: moderate, 3: severe) per day for 7 consecutive days.

In CSU, a “complete response” to omalizumab was
defined as a reduction of 90% or more in the UAS-7,
a “significant improvement” as a reduction in the UAS-7
of 90% — 30% and “no significant improvement” as less
than 30% reduction in the UAS-7 [12].

Total serum IgE, IgA, IgM, and IgG levels were measured using the turbidimetric method (Tokyo Boeki Pres
 

 

tige 24i, Japan). Blood neutrophil, lymphocyte, eosinophil
and platelet counts were measured using Sysmex XN1000 hematology analyzer.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 21.0. All
data were analyzed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for
normal distribution. Descriptive statistics were reported
using mean + standard deviation for data conforming
to normal distribution and median and 25-75" percentiles for data not conforming to normal distribution. For
statistical analysis, Wilcoxon and Mann Whitney U tests
were used for dependent groups. Type 1 error level was
considered 0.05.

Results

A total of 41 patients, 21 female and 20 male, were
enrolled in the study. Mean age was 45.65 +11.79 years,
mean duration of disease was 70.78 +59.0 months. Afer 12 weeks of omalizumab treatment, 17 (41.4%) patients had a complete response, 21 (51.2%) patients had
a significant improvement, and 3 (7.31%) patients did
not have any significant improvement based on UAS-7.
When pre- and post-12-week treatment immunoglobulin
evels were compared, there was no difference in IgG,
gA or IgM whereas there was a significant difference in
gE levels (jp < 0.001). Also, there was no difference in
lood eosinophil, lymphocyte or platelet levels whereas
a significant difference was observed in neutrophil levels
(p < 0.001) (Table 1).
lo significant differences were observed in baseline
gE, IgA, IgM, or IgG levels when patients were divided
into two groups as 17 (41.4%) patients with a complete
response and 24 (58.6%) patients without complete response (p = 0.48, p = 0.90, p = 0.58, p = 0.38). Again,

there was no difference in baseline eosinophil, neutrophil, lymphocyte or platelet levels when the two groups
were compared (p = 0.42, p = 0.23, p = 0.13, p = 0.50).

Discussion

Omalizumab binds to circulating free IgE and thereby
inhibits binding of IgE to FceRI. Since it does not bind IgE
on the cell surface, it does not directly affect mast cells
and basophils [13, 14]. A decrease in the circulating free
IgE levels results in reduction of the FceRI receptor count
on the surface of mast cells, basophils and other antigen
presenting cells [15-17].

In our study, we also compared eosinophil, neutrohil, lymphocyte and platelet levels obtained from preand post-12-week treatment whole blood parameters. We
ound a significant decrease in post-treatment neutrophil levels. Although there was a significant reduction in
neutrophil counts, this reduction was within the normal
reference range and we did not find any decrease in the
evel of neutropenia in any of the patients. In a case reported by Banh et al., mild neutrophilia had developed in
an asthmatic patient who was on omalizumab treatment

was also observed in patients who received omalizumab
19]. Similarly to the study by Yalcin et al., we observed
a significant reduction in neutrophil counts after omalizumab treatment.

The role of neutrophils in chronic spontaneous urticaria is unclear. Mediators are released from endotheial and epithelial cells, and pre-synthesized and newly
synthesized cytokines are released from mast cells and
asophils during late reactions. The primary effector cells
such as neutrophils, basophils, mast cells, eosinophils

and other immune cells such as macrophages, T cells
and natural killer (NK) cells are involved in late reactions
[20]. A significant decrease in the neutrophil count due
to the use of omalizumab observed both in our study
and in the study by Yalcin et al. suggests that it might
be one of the mechanisms of action of omalizumab
treatment. Although no decrease in the neutropenia
level was observed in our study, patients were followed
closely for a possible side effect due to omalizumab use.
A significant decrease has been shown in the number
of eosinophils after omalizumab treatment in patients
with asthma [21, 22]. However, no significant change in
eosinophil counts was observed in our study. We considered this as possibly related to the fact that our patients
had CSU, not asthma.

In the evaluation of patients for response to treatment based on UAS-7, there was a complete response
in 17 (41.4%) patients and a significant response in 21
(51.2%) patients, while there was no significant response
in 3 (7.31%) patients. Due to the lower number of patients without a significant response, patients were divided into two groups as patients with a complete response
(41.4%) and without a complete response (58.6%), and
aseline immunoglobulin levels and baseline eosinophils,
neutrophil, lymphocytes and platelet levels were comared. No significant difference was found.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Conclusions

Omalizumab treatment increases serum IgE levels
ut has no effect on immunoglobulin levels. Omalizumab
treatment can be used in patients with immunoglobuin deficiency when deemed necessary. Reduced blood
neutrophil counts related to omalizumab use were observed, therefore patients must be closely followed for
whole blood parameters.
