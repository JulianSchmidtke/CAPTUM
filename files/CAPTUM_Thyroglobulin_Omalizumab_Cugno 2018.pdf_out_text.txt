To the Editor,

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common condition characterized by episodes of itchy
wheals lasting more than six weeks [1]. Different biologic systems, i.e. autoimmunity, coagulation
and auto-allergy, concur to produce CSU symptoms [2]. The autoimmune mechanism is based on
circulating histamine-releasing IgG autoantibodies to the high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) on both
mast cells and basophils or membrane-bound IgE [3]. Coagulation cascade is activated in CSU
following the hyper-expression of tissue factor (TF) on activated skin eosinophils [4,5]. The recently
identified “auto-allergic’” mechanism is mediated by specific IgE to different auto-allergens [6-8]. The
recombinant anti-lgE humanized monoclonal antibody omalizumab was successfully used to treat

CSU patients who exhibited IgE against thyroperoxidase [9] and is nowadays the treatment of choice

for CSU unresponsive to 2™ generation H1 anti-histamines [1]. Its mechanism of action in CSU is not
completely defined but is regarded to act by lowering free IgE levels and down-regulating the FceRI
on mast cells and basophils. However, the frequent rapidity of response to omalizumab points

towards an IgE-mediated pathomechanism [2].

Here, we investigated the involvement of IgE to TF and thyroglobulin in 15 patients (mean+SD age:
53414 years; M/F: 1/14) with severe CSU (urticaria activity score [UAS 7]: 32+6; disease duration:
69+91 months). Demographics, clinical and laboratory features of patients are reported in table S1
(see Supporting Information: Data S1). A course of subcutaneous omalizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks
was started in all patients who were reassessed by means of UAS 7 one and two months later. The
measurement of anti-TF and anti-thyroglobulin IgE in plasma and the cellular antigen stimulation
test (CAST) on patients’ basophils were performed at baseline and one week after omalizumab
administration. Fifteen healthy subjects (1 man and 14 women, mean age 52+16 years) undergoing

routine check-up investigations served as normal controls for laboratory tests.

Anti-TF and anti-thyroglobulin IgE were measured by sandwich ELISA described for other
molecules [10]. CAST, which measures the amount of leukotriene C4 (LTC4) produced by blood
basophils after in vitro stimulation by an allergen, was also performed as described [10]. Data are
reported as median values and interquartile ranges (25th and 75th percentiles). The between-group
differences were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test for independent samples whereas the withingroup differences by the Wilcoxon test for paired samples with a significance level atp<0.05. The
good clinical response to omalizumab is reported in figure 1. At baseline, CSU patients showed
higher mean levels of IgE to TF (688 [415-815] OD) than normal controls (326 [129-424] OD;
p=0.001) and higher levels of IgE to thyroglobulin (520 [331-815] OD) than normal controls (184
[170-220] OD; p=0.001) (Figure 2). For IgE to TF, using 475 OD as a cut-off level (resulting from the
maximum level in normal subjects), nine out of 15 patients (60%) showed elevated specific IgE. For

IgE to thyroglobulin, using 278 OD as a cut-off level, thirteen out of 15 patients (87%) showed

elevated specific IgE. One week after omalizumab administration, the mean level of IgE to TF
dropped to 421 (183-696) OD (p=0.005) and the mean level of IgE to thyroglobulin dropped to 309
(268-506) OD (p=0.048) (Figure 2). The one-week drop of IgE to TF was directly correlated with the
drop of UAS 7 at two months of omalizumab treatment (r=0.564, p=0.028) while the one-week drop
of IgE to thyroglobulin was directly correlated with the drop of UAS 7 both at one (r=0.600, p= 0.018)

and two months (r=0.667, p=0.007) of omalizumab treatment.

At baseline, basophils from CSU patients showed higher mean release of LTC4 (190 [111-541]
pg/ml) than normal controls (120 [86-140] pg/ml; p=0.023) following stimulation with TF and higher
mean release of LTC4 (180 [100-475] pg/ml) than normal controls (115 [74-135] pg/ml; p=0.013)
following stimulation with thyroglobulin. For stimulation with TF, using 212 pg/ml as a cut-off level,
seven out of 15 patients (47%) showed an increased release of LTC4 while for stimulation with
thyroglobulin, using 180 pg/ml as a cut-off level, six out of 15 patients (40%) showed an increased
release of LTC4. One week after omalizumab administration, the mean release of LTC4 following
stimulation with TF dropped to 98 (72-130) pg/ml (p=0.003) while the mean release of LTC4
following stimulation with thyroglobulin dropped to 115 (85-135) pg/ml (p=0.008) (Figure 2). The
correlation between the one-week drop of LTC4 following stimulation with thyroglobulin was
directly correlated with the drop of UAS 7 both at one (0.609, p=0.047) and two months (r=0.729,

p=0.011) of omalizumab treatment.

Our data show that high levels of specific IgE to TF (a previously unreported autoallergen) and
thyroglobulin (previously reported in one patient with CU [11,12]) , can be detected in a relevant
proportion of patients with severe CSU, supporting the role of autoallergic mechanisms in the
disease. Thus, it seems to be conceivable to add TF and thyroglobulin to the currently short list of
autoallergens described in CSU, such as double strained DNA [6], thyroperoxidase [7] and IL-24 [8].
Moreover, the observation that basophils of CSU patients may release LTC4 upon stimulation with TF

and thyroglobulin provides further evidence for the involvement of the IgE-basophil system in CSU.

CAST is a functional test based upon the determination of LTC4 produced by interleukin-3 (IL-3)primed basophils stimulated in vitro by allergens [10] and has been used to diagnose allergy to
drugs, foods and occupational allergens. Here, it was used for the first time in CSU. Our data show
that CSU patients have elevated specific IgE antibodies to TF and these antibodies are functionally
able to mediate the release of LTC4 by TF-stimulated peripheral basophils. TF, the main initiator of
coagulation, is overexpressed in CSU lesional skin [5], where it can activate coagulation and is also
accessible to mast cell—-bound IgE. IgE-anti-TF could cause ‘autoallergic’ mast cell degranulation,
similarly to previously reported IgE to thyroperoxidase and IL-24 [7,8] and IgE to thyroglobulin seen
in the present study. In particular, thyroglobulin, that circulates in peripheral blood [13], may
interact with IgE-anti-thyroglobulin bound to mast cells and basophils throughout the body inducing
their degranulation. Autoreactive IgE against several targets in patients with CSU might explain, at
least in part, the clinical success of the anti-lgE omalizumab. Indeed, another noteworthy finding of
our study is just the decrease of specific IgE to TF and thyroglobulin induced by omalizumab. This fall
paralleled the clinical response to omalizumab in our patients who had sever CSU, supporting the
view that omalizumab acts as specific lgE-neutralizing agent in this disease. The possibility that
specific IgE occurred in the context of a concomitant IgG autoimmune response was unlikely
because only two out of 15 CSU patients had positivity for anti-thyroglobulin IgG and in these two
cases, levels of specific IgE to thyroglobulin (475 OD and 331 OD [table S$2]) were only slightly higher

than normal controls and below the 50th percentile of CSU patients.

with omalizumab. Based on UAS7 values 1 month after omalizumab administration, 14 out of 15
patients were classified as early responders. In one patient, UAS7 was unchanged. Nine patients
showed a complete clinical response (UAS7<6) while 5 patients showed a partial response (UAS7
from 8 to 18). At two months of omalizumab treatment, all 15 were classified as responders; in 9 the

response remained complete while in the other 6 it was partial.
