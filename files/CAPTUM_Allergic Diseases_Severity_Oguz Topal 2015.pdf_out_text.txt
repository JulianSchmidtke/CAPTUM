Abstract

Background: Vitamin D plays a key role in the immune responses generated by lymphocytes
and antigen-presenting cells. Decreased vitamin 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels have
been implicated in several allergic disorders and association between 25(OH)D levels and
chronic urticaria (CU) symptom scores has been evaluated in a few studies. This study was
performed to assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the symptoms and quality of
life scores in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and to vitamin D levels in CSU patients in
comparison with controls. Patients and methods: Fifty-eight CSU patients and forty-five controls
were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups according to severity of
the disease; as mild/moderate and severe urticaria. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)
concentrations were measured in serum of CSU patients and compared with the control
groups. In patients with 25(OH)D concentrations lower than 30 1g/L, 3000001U/month of
vitamin D3 supplementation was added to standard therapy. The clinical improvement was
evaluated after 3 months with urticaria activity score (UAS4) and Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life
Questionnaire (CU-Q2oL). Results: Serum 25(OH)D concentration was significantly lower in CSU
group compared to healthy subjects (p<0.001). The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (<20
(ug/L) and insufficiency (<30 j1g/L) was significantly higher in CSU patients than control groups.
In addition, 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly lower in both mild-moderate and
severe CSU patients than those of the controls (p=0.011 and p<0.001, respectively).
Ninety eight percent of patients (25(0H)D<30,g/L) were treated with vitamin D3
(300.000 1U/month) supplementation, and after 12 weeks, these patients showed significant
improvements in UAS4 and CU-Q2oL scores. Conclusion: This study support the contributing
and beneficial effects of vitamin D in the treatment of CU. Replacement of vitamin D may
provide improvement in both the severity of symptoms and the quality of life scores in these
patients.

Introduction

Urticaria is defined as a widespread, fugacious, itchy cutaneous
swelling; it is one of the most frequent dermatosis, being its
prevalence in general population estimated about 20% (1).
Histamine and other mediators are released from mast cells and
basophils in urticaria patients. However, the exact mechanism and
underlying triggers remain unclear (2).

Vitamin D plays a key role in the immune responses generated
by lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells. Recent studies
suggested that vitamin D deficiency contributes to the development of atopic dermatitis and vitamin D as potential immunomodulator of allergic disease because of its role in regulating
cathelicidin expression in the skin of subjects with atopic
dermatitis (3,4).

As compared to atopic dermatitis, there are significantly fewer
studies that have evaluated the potential link between vitamin D
and urticaria.

This prospective study aimed to determine the prevalence of
vitamin D deficiency in patients with chronic spontaneous
urticaria (CSU), and compare serum vitamin D levels between
patients and healthy controls. We also evaluated whether
replacement of vitamin D alleviate urticaria symptoms and
decrease quality of life scores.

Methods

In a prospective case-control study, we evaluated the levels of
25(OH)D) (25-hydroxyvitamin D) in 58 patients (14 year of age
or older) presenting with CSU and in age-matched control group
of 45 healthy subjects. CSU is defined as having recurrent wheals
occurring at least 3 times per week for more than 6 weeks within
the past year. A detailed patient file was recorded for all patients,
including the age and sex of the patients, cutaneous symptoms,
duration of disease, routine laboratory tests (full blood count,
urine analysis, C-reactive protein, stool (for parasites)), hepatitis

serology, thyroid tests and levels of anti-thyroid antibody and total
IgE. Patients with physical urticaria and urticarial vasculitis and
healthy subjects with significant medical history of low vitamin D
levels, those who have taken vitamin D supplements and pregnant
were excluded.

Urticaria symptom severity and quality of life were assessed
based on the Urticaria Activity Score over 4 days (UAS4) and
CU-Q2oL (Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire). The
Urticaria Activity Score over 4 day (UAS4) was used to measure
urticarial severity; this is a composite score (scale, 0-6) calculated
as the sum of daily average morning and evening scores for itch
severity (0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; and 3, severe) and number
of hives (0, none; 1, <20 hives; 2, 20-50 hives; and 3, >50 hives)
(5). Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire has been
widely used as a quality of life measure for chronic urticaria and
has been validated in Turkish language (6,7).

The patients were subdivided into three subgroups, according
to the urticarial activity score (UAS4) as follows: mild: (0-8),
moderate (9-16) and severe (17-24). Serum 25(OH)D concentration was measured with the use of an automated direct
Electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Elecsys, Roche
Diagnostic, Mannheim, Germany). Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks. Levels of
25(OH)D were categorized as sufficient (>30 j1g/L), insufficient
(<30 and >20 ug/L) and deficient (<20 pg/L).

Vitamin D replacement was done for patients with serum
levels of 25(OH)D below <30,1g/L. The patients with low
vitamin D were treated with 12 weeks of vitamin D3 300000 IU/
monthly and afterwards urticaria activity scores and CU-Q2oL
scores were evaluated again.

This study has been approved by the Ethics committee of
Okmeydani Research and Training Hospital (2014/April/195).
Written informed consent was obtained from all the subjects
participating.

The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version
1.2 for Windows, SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) computer software was
used for all statistical analyses. A p<0.05 was considered as
statistically significant. The Mann—Whitney U test, Wilcoxon test
and chi-square test were used to determine associations between
patients and control groups. Kruskal-Wallis variance analysis was
used to screen differences between the groups.

Results

Fifty-eight CSU patients were enrolled in our study. Forty-five of
the patients were female and 13 were male. The age of the
patients were between 14 and 75 years (mean age: 40.09 + 14.59).
Duration of the disease ranged between 1.5 months and 50 years
(mean duration: 3.44+7.49 years). The control group was
composed of 36 females and 9 males.

Three of the 58 patients (5.2%) had mild urticaria, with
urticaria activity scores ranging from 0 to 6. Fifteen of the 58
patients (25.8%) had moderate urticaria, with urticaria scores
ranging from 10 to 16. Forty of the 58 patients (68.9%) had severe
urticaria, with activity scores ranging from 17 to 24.

Anti-thyroglobulin antibody (anti-TG) and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO) were positive in 17.2% and 22.4% of
the patients. High levels of total IgE (>871U/mL) were found in
69.7% of the patients.

Median vitamin D level was 8.45 j1g/L (range 1.1—52.5 j1g/L)
in patients and 15.3 g/L in control group. Vitamin D levels were
significantly reduced in patients with CSU compared to controls
(p<0.001) (Table 1).

Vitamin D deficiency was present in 52 (89.7%) patients with
chronic urticaria and in 31 (68.9%) of controls. There was a
significant difference between CSU and control group regarding

(Table 2).

Vitamin D insufficiency was present in 57 (98.3%) patients
with CSU and in 39 (86.7%) in controls. There was a significant
difference between CSU and control group regarding the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (<30 j1g/L) (p = 0.041) (Table 2).

The patients (57 patients) who had low 25(OH)D levels
(<30 ug/L) were prescribed vitamin D 3000001U/month. There
were no significant differences between CSU patients with mildmoderate symptoms and severe symptoms regarding 25(OH)D
levels (median: 8.95 versus 7.1 g/L, p=0.139). However,
25(OH)D concentrations were significantly lower in mild-moderate CSU patients than those of the controls (8.95 versus
15.3 g/L, p=0.011) (Table 1). There were significant differences between severe CSU patients and the controls regarding
25(OH)D levels (7.1 versus 15.3 ug/L, p<0.001) (Table 1).

Improvement of urticaria symptoms and quality of life were
assessed by the Urticaria Activity Score over 4 day (UAS4) and
CU-Q2oL in vitamin D-deficient and insufficient groups.
A significant decrease in median UAS4 scores (21-6) from
baseline to 12 weeks was observed among CSU patients
(p<0.001). Furthermore, CU-Q2oL scores were significantly
improved from 38 (6.5—115.2) to 10.8 (0-43.4) from baseline to
12 weeks (p<0.001) (Table 3).

There were no significant differences between vitamin Ddeficient or insufficient group regarding CU-Q2oL and UAS4
scores (p >0.001). There was no association between the anti-TG
and the anti-TPO autoantibodies and the levels of vitamin D in
CSU patients (p = 0.641 and p= 0.373, respectively). There was
no association between the prevalence of high levels of total IgE
and the levels of vitamin D in CSU patients (y=0.5). The
analysis of the association between subject characteristics and
serum 25(OH)D concentrations is shown in Table 1.

Discussion

Recent studies have shown vitamin D receptors on distinct cell
types such as T cells, B cells, neutrophils and macrophages.
Vitamin D affects both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms
(8,9). It affects the innate immune system by stimulating the
production of cathelicidin which is an anti-microbial peptide that

is activated through toll-like receptors. Furthermore, 1,25(O0H)2D
inhibits dendritic cell migration, IL-12 and IL-23 cytokine
production, thereby reducing T helper type 1 cells and potentially
leading to increased proliferation of allergy-associated T helper
type 2 cells. Due to these immunological findings of vitamin D,
the studies have been conducted to identify whether vitamin D
affects serum levels of immunoglobulin E (3,9,10). Heine et al.’s
study showed that stimulated B cells markedly decrease the
production of IgE following the administration of vitamin D (11).
Most of the studies to assess the effect of vitamin D on allergic
skin diseases focused especially on atopic dermatitis. Peroni et al.
conducted a study in patients with atopic dermatitis and they
found an inverse correlation between serum concentrations of
vitamin D and severity of atopic dermatitis (12). Javanbakht et al.
demonstrated that administration of vitamin D showed a significant improvement in the SCORAD index as compared to placebo
(13).

In subsequent years, Goetz et al. sought to determine whether a
relationship between vitamin D and chronic urticaria exists. They
evaluated 50 patients with CU and determined that vitamin D
levels were significantly reduced in patients compared with
controls (14). Similarly we found that, the prevalence of vitamin
D deficiency was high in our CSU patients group (89.7%).

Earlier studies reported that the vitamin D replacement
decreased disease activity in urticaria patients (14). Goetz et al.
studied to identify whether vitamin D supplementation can
improve health outcomes in patients with pruritus, rash and CU.
Ninety percent of patients had low vitamin D levels and 61% of 28
patients with urticaria/angioedema resolved cutaneous symptoms
with vitamin D supplementation in their study (15). Boonpiyathad
et al. revealed a significant rate of low serum 25(OH) concentrations in patients with CSU. And they investigated the effect of
vitamin D replacement in those patients based on the measurement of urticaria activity scores and Dermatology Life Quality
Index scores. They concluded that vitamin D supplementation
might improve symptoms and quality of life in CSU patients (16).
We detected similar findings in our study. After vitamin D
supplementation, urticaria activity scores and CU-Q2oL scores
significantly decreased (p <0.001).

Grzanca et al. showed that the rate of vitamin D deficiency
proved significantly higher in CSU patients. But, they found no
significant differences in the prevalence of 25(OH)D insufficiency between CSU patients and normal subjects (17). Thorp
et al. reported that the frequency of vitamin D deficiency and
insufficiency in CU patients was not significantly different from
the control group (p = 0.24) (18). The prevalence of vitamin D
deficiency was 89.7% and vitamin D insufficiency was 98.3% in
our study. In contrast to former studies, we found a significant
difference between the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency or
insufficiency in patients with CSU and control groups (p<0.05).
In addition, 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly lower in
mild-moderate CSU and severe CSU patients than those of the
controls (p =0.011 and p<0.001 respectively).

Although some data demonstrated that 25(OH)D levels are
associated with an increased activity/severity of the inflammatory
diseases, Thorp et al. detected that the levels of vitamin D in

 

 

urticaria patients did not correlate with duration or severity of the
disease (4,17). Similarly, the levels of vitamin D did not
significantly differ between mild-moderate CSU and _ severe
CSU patients in our study. These findings suggest that vitamin
D does not affect the clinical progress, alone. Other factors may
play a role in the etiopathogenesis.

The cause of CSU remains unclear. But over the years, a
number of direct and indirect measures of immune activation,
complement activation, histamin release or neuroendocrine function have been suggested as a cause of CSU. Furthermore, it has
been argued that the presence of thyroid autoantibodies play a role
in the etiopathogenesis of CSU (19). Verneuil et al. compared the
frequency of anti-thyroid antibodies in healthy individuals and
patients with CSU, demonstrating a statistical association between
anti-TPO or anti-TG antibodies and CSU; the frequency of these
antibodies in CSU patients was 26.7% compared to 3.3% in
healthy subjects (p <0.01) (20). In our study, the percent of antiTG and anti-TPO were 17.2% and 22.4%, respectively. We
determined that the prevalence of anti-thyroid antibodies was
significantly higher in our CSU patients. With respect to
association between vitamin D and thyroid autoantibodies, we
did not find a positive correlation.

Urticaria results from the activation of cutaneous mast cells.
The release of mast cell-derived mediators may be caused by both
immune and nonimmune mechanisms. Huilan et al. demonstrated
that total IgE significantly increased in acute and CU patients
(21). Sixty-nine percent of our patients had high levels of Ig E.
But, there was no association between the total Ig E and the
vitamin D.

In conclusion, we revealed two significant findings in this
study. First, there was a high incidence of vitamin D deficiency or
insufficiency among Turkish urticaria patients. Secondly, urticaria
activity scores and CU-Q2oL scores in the vitamin D-deficient or
insufficient group decreased in response to vitamin D replacement. Vitamin D supplementation seems to significantly improve
hives symptoms and quality of life in CSU patients. We believe,
immunomodulator and anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D
possibly provided these consequences.
