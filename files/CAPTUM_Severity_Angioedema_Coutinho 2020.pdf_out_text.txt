Abstract
Background: Chronic urticaria (CU) is defined as recurrent urticaria lasting for more than 6 weeks.

Objectives: We aimed to characterize the phenotypes of patients with CU refractory to standard dose anti-H1
antihistamine treatment and search for clinical predictors of poor disease control.

Methods: Retrospective collection of data regarding clinical characteristics, comorbidities, treatment, and disease
control of all adult refractory CU patients presenting to the Allergy and Immunology Department during 1 year.

Results: Sixty-one adult patients were included, 74% females, average age 44.5 years (18 to 84 years old). Most
patients (78.7%) had initiated CU less than 1 year before enrolment. Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) accounted
for 55.7% of the patients, CSU associated with chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU) as a comorbidity for 44.3%, and
angioedema was present in 55.7%. Medically-confirmed psychiatric disorders were present in 78.7%. Complementary
diagnostic tests were performed in cases with more severe presentation (UAS7 > 28 and/or UCT < 12) or with longer
evolution (> 1 year), corresponding to 42 tested patient. Evidence for autoimmunity (positive anti-thyroid peroxidase
antibodies, anti-nuclear antibodies or autologous serum test) was found in 45.2% (n = 19/42), and high C-reactive
protein was present in 14.3% (n= 6/42), half of these also had positive antinuclear antibodies. Forty-six patients
(75.4%) had at least one significant exacerbation, requiring medical appointment, emergency room, hospitalization or
job absenteeism. The number of exacerbations correlated with the presence of angioedema (p= 0.022), with a recent
diagnosis (<1 year), and with higher UAS7 severity (p = 0.006). Although ClndU was associated with poor symptom
control (p= 0.022), it was also associated with less exacerbations requiring medical observation or hospitalization
(p=0.015). All patients were using antihistamines and 21.3% (n= 13) of them were also under treatment with
omalizumab, ciclosporine or montelukast for disease control.

Conclusions: Autoimmunity can affect about half of the patients with severe or long-term CU. UAS7 and
angioedema are associated with disease exacerbations. UAS7 and UCT presented unequal accuracy, with UAS7 better
associating with the occurrence of exacerbations and treatment doses. Patients with refractory CU frequently present
psychiatric disorders. Accurate diagnostic tests, namely autoimmune parameters and inflammatory markers, should
be recommended in some individual cases.

auto-inflammatory syndromes, urticarial vasculitis
(UV), or bradykinin-mediated angioedema, including
hereditary angioedema [1].

Chronic urticaria (CU) is defined by the presence of
recurrent urticaria, angioedema, or both, for a period of
6 weeks or longer [1, 2]. In most patients, CU is a selflimited disorder, with an average duration of 2 to 5 years.
However, in up to 30% of the patients, the symptoms may
persist for more than 5 years [1, 3].

CU is a common disorder, with a lifetime estimated
prevalence of up to 1 percent of the general population
in the United States, 7.8% in Germany, 9.0% in Southwest
Norway and 3.4% in Portugal [1, 4-7]. CU is more
common in adults than in children, and women are
affected twice as often as men [8, 9]. The condition
typically begins between the third and the fifth decades
of life [4, 8].

The EAACI/GA?LEN/EDEF/WAO consensus [1, 2]
classified CU into two subtypes for clinical use: (1)
chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), when no specific
eliciting factors are identified, or (2) chronic inducible
urticaria (ClndU), when specific stimuli trigger the
symptoms. CIndU include symptomatic dermographism,
cold urticaria, delayed pressure urticaria, solar urticaria,
heat urticaria, vibratory angioedema, cholinergic
urticaria, contact urticaria and aquagenic urticaria. Two
or more different subtypes of urticaria may coexist in any
given patient.

The diagnosis of CSU is based on clinical history,
physical examination, and the evaluation of some
specific factors that aggravate CSU in a substantial
subset of patients, such as newly administrated drugs
(e.g. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs—NSAIDS
and hormonal therapies), infections (viral, bacterial and
parasitic), IgE-mediated allergic reactions, insect stings,
emotional stress, alcohol, and some dietary habits (e.g.,
spicy food) [9-18]. The diagnosis of CIndU is based on
the patient’s clinical history and, if possible, the result of
provocation tests. In patients with suspected ClndUs, it
is important to identify and accurately characterize the
trigger to confirm diagnosis and assess disease activity.

Routine laboratory tests seldom reveal abnormalities
when the medical history does not suggest an underlying
allergic etiology or the presence of systemic disease
{1, 19]. Complementary laboratory tests (erythrocyte
sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, blood
count, complement factors, antinuclear antibodies,
cryoglobulins, hepatitis B and C serologies, serum
protein electrophoresis, thyroid function and others) are
recommended only in cases in which the clinical history
suggests an underlying etiology [1, 13, 20]. The concept
that CU could represent an autoimmune disorder
resulted from the recognition that thyroid dysfunction

Page 2 of 9

and thyroid autoantibodies are more prevalent in
patients with CSU [21]. Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs)
are also more prevalent in patients with CU than in
the general population [8]. Consequently, the presence
of autoantibodies can be investigated upon clinical
suspicion by the autologous serum skin test (AutoST) or
other markers such as ANAs or antithyroid antibodies
(22]. Autoimmunity and autoallergy, due to IgG and/or
IgE autoantibodies have been considered as an etiology
of CU [23]. It was proposed that an autoantibody or other
histamine release factor could be present in the serum
of these patients (especially those who had positive
autologous serum skin test), namely human IgG directed
against the IgE receptor alpha subunit (anti-Fc-epsilonRl-alpha) and human IgG directed against the region
IgE Fe (anti-IgE) [24]. Although the presence of these
autoantibodies can be demonstrated, their availability is
still scarce, and, currently, its clinical utility is not well
established. Skin biopsy may be performed to exclude UV,
particularly in CU refractory to antihistaminic treatment,
with individual painful lesions rather than pruritic,
with purpuric lesions, or when systemic symptoms are
present, such as arthralgias and/or fever [25]. Although
UV is not currently part of the CU in current disease
guidelines, its finding during CU evaluation can lead
to a diagnosis of systemic diseases, mainly connective
tissue diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus,
Sjogren’s syndrome, IgM paraproteinemia (Schnitzler
Syndrome), serum disease, infections (hepatitis B,
infectious mononucleosis), and hypersensitivity to drugs
[26]. Histology findings can also predict the response to
treatment. The presentation of a neutrophil pattern in
histology has been associated with refractory chronic
urticarial [27].

The EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF/WAO International
Urticaria Directive recommends second generation
H1-antihistamines (H1-AH) in standard dose therapy,
however, treatment with H1-antihistamine leads to the
absence symptoms in less than 50% of patients [1, 28].
The prospective study AWARE (Germany) analyzed 1550
patients with H1 anti-histamine-refractory CSU in a
1-year non-interventional trial. In this study, 59.1% of the
patients had papules at least once in the last 6 months,
16.1% reported at least 1 episode of angioedema, and
28.2% had moderate/high/very high impact on quality of
life, namely due to pruritus, sleep disturbance and mental
status disorders [28]. Regarding control medications,
17.4% of the patients were not following guideline
recommended CU treatment [29]. A similar AWARE
study was conducted in Portugal and included 76
patients [30]. It showed that both wheals and angioedema
independently affect chronic urticaria quality of life
questionnaire (CU-QoL) [30]. Guideline recommended
Alen Coutinho et al. Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol (2020) 16:97

non-sedative H1-AH treatment was used in almost
91.0% of patients at enrollment [30]. A total of 43.9%
had moderate to severe urticaria, out of which 35.4%
were medicated with third line therapy (omalizumab or
cyclosporine), while 10.8% used oral corticosteroids, a
lower percentage compared to the study performed in
Germany [29].

There is a growing need for standardization of
biomarkers to assess the severity and activity of CU
and improve response to treatment. The objectives of
our study were: (1) to characterize the clinical features,
subtypes, cofactors, treatment and disease control status
in adult refractory CU patients followed in an Allergy and
Immunology Department (2) and to look for clinical and
laboratorial predictors of poor disease control (including
both exacerbations and symptom control).

Methods

This is a retrospective, cross-sectional, and inferential
study that included all adult patients with medicallyconfirmed diagnosis of CU (as defined by EAACI
guideline [1, 2]) refractory to approved doses of H1-AH
treatment, that were observed at the outpatient clinic
of the Allergy and Immunology Department of Centro
Hospitalar e Universitario de Coimbra, Portugal, during
one year.

Disease characteristics outcomes

Patients were evaluated and characterized according to
demographic data, subtypes of urticaria, angioedema,
associated comorbidities, such as medically diagnosed
psychiatric disorders. Asthma and other atopic diseases
were also evaluated according to European Academy of
Allergy and Clinical Immunology and Global Initiative
for Asthma criteria. Diagnostic work-up and treatment
data were collected from the medical records at the same
time as CU control was evaluated, using two methods:

1. Significant —_ exacerbations—defined as CU
exacerbations that required unscheduled medical
consultations, emergency room admission,

hospitalization or job absenteeism during the
previous year;

2. Activity and disease control scores: Urticaria Control
Test (UCT) [31] and Urticaria Activity Score 7
(UAS7) [32].

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics
version 24.0°. Descriptive statistics were analyzed as
mean and standard deviation for the variables with
normal distribution, and median and interquartile range

Page 3 of 9

for the variables without normal distribution. Variables
were also described in absolute number (n). The nominal
variables were compared using Pearson’s chi-square test
or Fisher’s exact test according to Cochran's rules. The
normal distribution of the ordinal variables was evaluated
using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (considering a
population sample of more than 30 individuals in both
groups). The comparison of these variables was tested
using Student’s T-tests (parametric test, applied after
verifying the homogeneity of variances by the Levene
test) or Mann-Whitney test (non-parametric test). A
Type | error of 0.05 was considered.

Results

Demographics and CU clinical characteristics

Sixty-one adult patients with CU were evaluated, 73.8%
(n=45) were female and 26.2% (n= 16) male. The median
age of patients was 44.5+14.9 years, ranging from 18
to 84 years old. Most patients (78.7%) had initiated CU
symptoms less than 1 year before enrollment (Table 1).

Regarding the characterization of the CU type, 55.7%
(n=34) were diagnosed with CSU and 44.3% (n=27)
with CSU associated with CIndU as a comorbidity. The
ClndU subtypes diagnosed in our population are shown
in Table 2 (70.4% of patients were afflicted by more than
on type of ClndU and all had associated spontaneous
urticaria). Females accounted for 88.9% (n=24/27) of
ClndU patients, while only 61.8% of the CSU (n= 21 /34)
were females (p =0.021, Chi-Square Tests).

Thirty-four patients (55.7%) had at least one episode
of angioedema within the last year. The presence of
angioedema did not significantly associate with sex, age,
recent onset of CU or the subtype of CU.

 

Comorbidities

The frequency of comorbid atopic diseases was: asthma
in 21.3% (n=13), rhinitis in 29.5% (n=18) and the
combination of the two diseases in 32.8% (n=20).
Medically-confirmed psychiatric disorders (depression
and/or anxiety disorder) were present in 78.7% (n=48).
Other comorbidities, such as arterial hypertension, type
2 diabetes and obesity were present in 31.2% (n= 19).

Diagnostic work-up
Complementary diagnostic tests were performed in cases
in which the clinical history suggested an underlying
etiology, according to the local follow-up protocols,
namely for patients with more severe presentation
(UAS7 > 28 and/or UCT <12) or with longer evolution
(>1 year).

Complementary tests performed for further classifying
CU were complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP),

CRP was high in six patients (6/42 = 14.3%) and half of
these also had positive ANAs. In patients with high CRP
results, infectious causes such as HSV, HBV, CMV, EBV
and HIV were excluded. Regarding ESR testing (n=42),
none of the tested patients presented abnormal values
(1-20 mm/h).

Evidence for autoimmunity markers (positive antithyroid peroxidase antibodies, anti-nuclear antibodies
or AutoST) was found in 45.2% (n=19) of 42 tested
patients. ANAs assay was positive in one third (n= 14)
of 42 tested patients. The “dense fine speckled” was
the most frequent (n=10), followed by the “nucleolar
pattern” (n=4). Routine measurement of thyroid
stimulating hormone (TSH) has not been approved by
international guidelines since 2018 [1]. Among patients
who had positive ANAs, 21.4% (n= 3/14) had a diagnosis
of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). The remaining 4
cases of AITD were ANAs negative, corresponding to a
total of seven patients (7/42 = 16.7%).

The AutoST was performed in 9.8% (n=8) patients
with suspected diagnosis of autoimmune urticaria. Only
one patient (out of 8) had a positive AutoST. This patient
had been diagnosed with CU less than 1 year before
evaluation and had a severe presentation of the disease,
only partially controlled with the four antihistamines/day
and omalizumab, and with frequent job absenteeism due
to CU. The patient was also positive ANAs but negative
for autoimmune thyroid antibodies.

Skin biopsy was performed on patients with unusual
presentations, namely painful lesions, corresponding
to a total of 9.8% (n=6) patients; histological findings
in all cases were compatible with the diagnosis of
urticaria, showing interstitial edema with mixed
perivascular infiltrate (lymphocytes, eosinophils and a
few neutrophils/basophils).

Treatment

All patients were on first-line therapy with nonsedating H1 antihistamines at the time of evaluation,
with the majority of the patients receiving a twice-aday regimen (52.4%, n=32, Table 3). Among those
treated with omalizumab (n=4), four had CSU, one of
them with autoimmune urticarial confirmed by positive
AutoST, and one had several subtypes of ClndU, namely
cholinergic urticaria, pressure urticaria and symptomatic
dermographism. Atopy was present in all patients
receiving montelukast therapy as additional therapy,
resulting in an improvement of CU control with its
introduction and in a reduction in the number of daily
antihistamines to 1 per day in all cases. One patient was
treated with ciclosporin after therapeutic failure with
omalizumab. This was a 45-year-old female patient, with
obesity and arterial hypertension, with CSU associated

with angioedema diagnosis < 1 year and presenting poorly
controlled CU and angioedema despite medication
with cetirizine four times a day (40 mg) and showing no
clinical worsening of arterial hypertension at the time of
data collection.

Three patients were evaluated during acute
exacerbations and were under treatment with systemic
corticosteroid therapy as additional therapy.

Clinical exacerbations and disease control
Disease status was evaluated using two outcomes:
significant exacerbations and activity/disease control
scores (UAS7 and UCT). Significant exacerbations of
CU were defined by the need of unscheduled medical
consultations, emergency room, hospitalization or job
absenteeism. Forty -six patients (75.4%) had at least one
significant exacerbation during the previous year. The
median number of visits to the Emergency Department
(ED) was one visit/patient/year, with the majority of
patients (45.9%, n=28) presenting with one or two ED
episodes in one year, and a maximum value of four visits
in one year. Hospitalizations due to CU exacerbation
occurred in 8.2% (n=5) of the patients, and four of these
patients had both CU and angioedema presentation for
less than 1 year. Unplanned consultations were needed
in about half of the population and job absenteeism
occurred in 14.8% (n= 9) of patients, with a maximum of
90 days and a minimum of 1 day (Table 4).

The number of exacerbations correlated with higher
UAS7 symptom scores (p =0.006, Spearman correlation).

In our sample, patients with ClndU had worst disease
control scores (UAS7 and UCT questionnaires) when
compared to patients with CSU only (p=0.022,
Mann-Whitney test). However, ClndU patients had
fewer exacerbations requiring medical observation or
hospitalization (p =0.015, Mann—Whitney test).

A high number of antihistamines, use of corticosteroid
therapy and/or ciclosporin for disease control correlated
with higher UAS7 scores (p=0.006, Spearman
correlation) but no significant correlation was observed
with the UCT score. The presence of angioedema
associated with a higher number of exacerbations
(p=0.022, Mann—Whitney test) but with no differences
concerning disease control (UAS7 and UCT), or the
number of antihistamines used. Atopy (allergic asthma,
allergic rhinitis, food allergy and atopic dermatitis)
and autoimmunity (positive antithyroid peroxidase
antibodies, ANAs and/or AutoST) did not significantly
associate with the symptom scores or exacerbations. No
other statistically significant associations were observed
in relation to other variables, namely, complementary
diagnostic tests or the presence of comorbidities.

Discussion
We here presented new data on refractory CU and looked
for clinical factors associating with worse outcomes
(exacerbations and symptom control).

This study reflects the resources allocated to diagnose
and treat patients with refractory chronic urticaria and
describes the real-life scenario and clinical management
Alen Coutinho et al. Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol (2020) 16:97

in an urticaria center in a tertiary hospital. Similar to
other studies in Portugal and other countries [29, 30,
33, 34], more than 70% of the patients were female
and the median age was around 45 years old. CSU
represented more than 55% of all cases of CU, however,
a wide variability has been found [34-36]. Although the
predominance of female patients was evident in the two
groups of CU, CSU and ClndJU, patients with ClndU had
a higher predominance of females compared to CSU.
This does not corroborate the literature, which indicates
the absence of significant gender differences in ClndU
compared to other types of urticarial [37].

Although provocation tests should be performed
whenever possible, the risk of serious reactions during
provocation tests results in low application of these
tests [2]. However, in our center, patients with suspected
ClIndUs are tested and remain under the supervision
of a doctor and nurse for a specific time, according to
the suspected trigger. In the specific case of delayed
pressure urticaria, the medical supervision time at our
center is 6 h after the test is performed. In cases where
symptoms appear later, we encourage patients to make a
photographic record. This justifies that despite delayed
pressure urticaria is found to be a relatively rare form
of physical urticaria in most case series [38], in our
study it was present in a high number of patients (44.4%
of ClndU, n=12/27). It appears immediately (within
minutes) or, more commonly, 4 to 6 h after a variety of
pressure stimuli, which is not consistently recognised
by the patients and clinicians. In our clinic, we routinely
inquire the specific signs of the different triggers for all
types of inducible urticaria, which is followed by the
specific test to confirm the diagnosis.

Being a mast cell disease and potentially associated
with an autoimmune disease, diagnoses of systemic
autoimmune diseases and other mast cell disorders
should be considered [39, 40]. Apparently, CU is
associated with a specific pattern of comorbidities,
including autoimmune, atopic and psychiatric diseases
and there is no clear pattern in relation to malignant
and cardiovascular diseases [41]. In a Danish study by
Ghazanfar et al. which evaluated the comorbidities of
patients with CU in all centers in Denmark, over a 21-year
period, atopic diseases were strongly overrepresented
among patients [41]. In our population, about one third
of patients had at least one associated atopic disease.
Ghazanfar et al. also found a high prevalence anxiety/
depression in the group of patients with CU, which is in
line with the results of our work [40]. Hypertension has
been associated with a prolonged duration of CU [42],
although other studies that examined the prevalence of
cardiovascular diseases in populations with CU did not
find an increased risk of these comorbidities compared

Page 6 of 9

to the general population [43]. Our work showed a
percentage of about 20.0% of patients who had a previous
diagnosis of arterial hypertension. In this subgroup, with
the exception of one patient who experienced therapeutic
failure with omalizumab, the choice of treatment
with cyclosporine was not considered by clinicians,
speculating the consideration that its presence influenced
the therapeutic choice. It is known that corticosteroids
influence the glycemic profile, so it did not seem
surprising that patients with a diagnosis of diabetes were
not on corticosteroid therapy. Skin biopsy was performed
on 9.8% of the patients. This procedure is not routinely
needed for the diagnosis of CU but should be considered
in newly formed wheal if urticarial vasculitis is suspected.

The use of 2nd generation H1 antihistamines was
observed in the whole sample, as recommended by
current guidelines [1], contrarily to other studies in
which the therapy was not totally in agreement with
those suggested by the guidelines [29]. The number of
patients undergoing third-line therapy with omalizumab,
ciclosporine and montelukast was 21.3% (n=13), which
differed from other series, with a higher value [29].

CBC, ESR and CRP were requested for most patients,
which is in line with European and recommendations
{1]. Autoimmunity has been implicated in CU, resulting
in the activation of systemic inflammatory processes
that have implications in the evolution and control
of the disease. High levels of CRP have been related to
the presence of a systemic inflammatory process of
autoimmunity in CU and, therefore, to disease activity
[44]. Takahagi et al. demonstrated that high levels of
CRP correlated with disease activity [45]. Our work
also found the presence of a group of patients with high
CRP values, half of which also had positive antinuclear
antibodies, demonstrating the importance of evaluating
this parameter as a possible predictor of poor control and
relationship with autominuity.

Autoimmune urticaria is implicated as a cause of CU in
about 30% to 50% of idiopathic cases [46]. In autoimmune
uricaria, the involvement of autoantibodies causing
histamine release after reaction with immunoglobulin
E (IgE) epitopes or with the high affinity IgE receptor
chain (Fc RI) receivers, should be considered, especially
in positive AutoST [1, 46] Due to the lack of access to
these methodologies in our hospital at the time of data
collection, this complementary method had not yet been
carried out.

ANAs are a group of autoantibodies directed against
nucleus antigens and are found in many patients with
autoimmune diseases. These autoimmunity markers
are positive in patients with CU by approximately
15-29% [42, 46].The detection of ANAs in serum has
been carried out for several years to screening for
Alen Coutinho et al. Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol (2020) 16:97

autoimmune diseases, but this analysis lacks some
degree of subjectivity. While it may be important to
acknowledge the presence of these autoimmune markers
to understand the CU mechanism, its role is not fully
explained, neither its research criteria fully defined.
Margen et al. published a study aimed at identifying
clinical and laboratory attributes of patients with positive
ANAs and CU [46]. One of the conclusions of the study
was that this subgroup of patients (with positive ANAs)
was characterized by greater refractoriness to treatment
with standard licensed doses of antihistamines, despite
the fact that most patients do not have associated
autoimmune diseases [45]. These results were consistent
taking into account the small prevalence of autoimmune
diseases in the general population (around 5—7%) [45].
Our work showed an important percentage of positive
ANAs patients, however only a few cases were diagnosed
with autoimmune diseases. These results speculate the
need to standardize the measurement of these markers
in all population with CU refractory to antihistamine
therapy, reinforcing the need to avoid their arbitrary
research.

Thyroid disease is the most commonly reported
autoimmune disease in patients with CU [46].
Approximately 5 to 34% of patients with CU have
antithyroid antibodies and another 5 to 10% have
clinically or biochemically confirmed thyroid disease
[46]. The association between AITD and CU is an
unsolved mystery and the criteria for when to request
this type of complementary study are not completely
defined/clarified [47]. Thus, the fact that not all patients
in our population have undergone this complementary
study is justified.

It is known that the prevalence of psychiatric disorders
are evident in CU, however there are limited studies on
their association with CU severity [48]. The present study
in patients with refractory CU showed an overwhelming
prevalence of psychiatric disorders (depression and/or
anxiety), highlighting the potential for predicting poor
disease control and the need for a multidisciplinary
approach in these patients. The high prevalence can
also be justified by the fact that there is an important
prevalence of these disorders in the Portuguese general
population, according to the World Health Organization
in a 2015 data survey [49], where Portugal had an
estimated prevalence of 5.7% for depression and 4.9% for
anxiety. These comorbidities should not be neglected in
patients with chronic diseases such as CU, with research
being of crucial importance.

Although the level of evidence for the efficacy of
treatment with leukotriene receptor anatgonists being
low, the drug that has been showing better results
was montelukast [50]. It was found that at the data

Page 7 of 9

collection, patients who were treated with montelukast
had atopy (asthma and/or rhinitis with positive tests for
aeroallergens) and CU disease control.

In our sample, the use of severity and therapeutic
monitoring scores—UAS7 and UCT—presented
unequal accuracy, with UAS7 better associating with
the occurrence of exacerbations and treatment doses,
emphasizing the recommended routine use of the UAS7
score has an important therapeutic value for the daily
monitoring of patients. It is important to highlight that
angioedema is not part of the UAS7 questionnaire.
Patients with exacerbations requiring unplanned
consultations, emergency visits or hospitalization
were mainly patients with a shorter course of disease
(<1 year). According to the literature, ClndU treatment
is mainly symptomatic with avoidance of eliciting triggers
(37]. Thus, most of our exacerbating population also
corresponds to patients with CSU whose trigger has not
been identified, resulting in a more challenging symptom
control.

Regarding our data, it appears that the presence of
angioedema may indicate a possible predictor of poor
disease control, making the choice of treatment crucial
for its control. Sussman et al. considered that the
presence of angioedema in CU is underreported and
that it seems to be associated with an important negative
impact, namely in the quality of life in daily activities and
work performance, compared with patients who have CU
without angioedema [51].

Conclusions

This study involved a limited number of patients that
were regularly observed at an Allergology and Clinical
Immunology Department of a University Hospital. It was
decided to make a multidisciplinary approach involving
also psychiatrists and Internal Medicine specialists to
better characterize refractory chronic urticaria. Patients
were also submitted to a large number of complementary
diagnostic tests to identify associated pathology. Despite
having some limitations, namely in its retrospective
nature, several conclusions could be drawn in our work:
(1) CSU alone is frequent but CSU associated with CIndU
as a comorbidity can affect almost half of the patients; (2)
The CSU symptomatic group with more exacerbations
can include patients with a recent diagnosis (<1 year);
(3) Angioedema can often be present and be correlated
with an higher number of exacerbations; (4) UAS7 and
UCT presented unequal accuracy, with UAS7 better
associating with the occurrence of exacerbations and
treatment doses; (5) Patients with refractory CU can be
prone to psychiatric disorders, such as depression and/
or anxiety and (6) accurate diagnostic tests, namely

autoimmune parameters and inflammatory markers,
should be recommended in some individual cases.

It is important to have a growing knowledge and
a uniform management of refractory CU with its
characterization by phenotypes, which make it possible
to identify predictors of therapeutic response in order
to contribute for better and personalized strategies to
control this disease.
