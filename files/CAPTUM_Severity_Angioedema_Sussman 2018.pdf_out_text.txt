angioedema data from medical records, which were compared with patient-reported
data. Patients in the Yes-angioedema category had angioedema reported in the medical record and a patient-reported source. For those in the No-angioedema category,
angioedema was reported in neither the medical record nor a patient-reported
source. Those in the Misaligned category had angioedema reported in only one
source. Statistical comparisons between Yes-angioedema and No-angioedema categories were conducted for measures of CSU activity, health-related quality of life
(HRQoL), productivity and healthcare resource utilization (HCRU). Regression analyses explored the relationship between Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score
and angioedema, adjusting for important covariates.

Results: Among evaluable patients, 259 (40.3%), 173 (26.9%) and 211 (32.8%) were
in the Yes-angioedema, No-angioedema and Misaligned category, respectively. CSU
activity and impact on HRQolL, productivity, and HCRU was greater for Yes-angioedema patients than No-angioedema patients. After covariate adjustment, mean DLQI
score was significantly higher (indicating worse HRQoL) for patients with angioedema versus no angioedema (9.88 vs 7.27, P < .001). The Misaligned category had
similar results with Yes-angioedema on all outcomes.

Conclusions: Angioedema in CSU seems to be under-reported but has significant

negative impacts on HRQolL, daily activities, HCRU and work compared with no

angioedema.

1 | INTRODUCTION

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is characterized by the presence
of hives, angioedema or both, recurring for 6 weeks or longer, in the
absence of identifiable triggers.1* Angioedema is defined as rapid
swelling at a deeper level under the skin than hives, occurring on
the face, inside the mouth or elsewhere on the body.2? It is estimated that 33%-67% of patients with CSU exhibit both hives and
angioedema, 29%-65% exhibit only hives and 1%-13% exhibit only
angioedema.*°

Patients who experience CSU as concurrent hives and angioedema often experience a longer duration of disease than patients
who experience only hives.” Angioedema may be disfiguring or
painful, may limit daily activities and may have a significant impact
on quality of life. Patients with CSU-associated angioedema often
experience concern over their health status, at times worrying that
swelling episodes may cause problems with breathing or may be lifethreatening.” A real-world multicentre study in Germany has shown
that in a 6-month period, more than 40% of patients with inadequately controlled CSU experienced angioedema; among these
patients, 78% rated their angioedema as severe or moderate in
intensity, and a mean of 34 days with angioedema was reported during the 6-month period.” In addition to its considerable symptom

burden, recurrent angioedema (in those with hereditary angioedema)

Highlights

e Nearly one-third of CSU patients in ASSURE-CSU
reported having experienced angioedema in the past
12 months but did not have physician-reported angioedema as documented in their medical records.

e Patients with angioedema had greater CSU activity,
HRQoL and productivity impairment, and resource utilization than those without. After controlling for other
factors, angioedema significantly affected DLQI total
score.

e Among patients with inadequately controlled symptomatic CSU, the proportion with angioedema may be

higher than previously thought.

can lead to absenteeism and can have a negative impact on work
productivity.1°

The observational, multinational ASSURE-CSU (ASsessment of
the Economic and Humanistic Burden of Chronic Spontaneous/Idiopathic URticaria PatiEnts) study aimed to characterize the patient
population with inadequately controlled CSU and to evaluate the
burden of disease.t?? Analyses of ASSURE-CSU data revealed

different rates of CSU-associated angioedema between physician
and patient reports.’? The objectives of this post hoc analysis were
to provide a better estimate of angioedema rates among CSU
patients in the ASSURE-CSU study by aligning patient and physician
reports and to analyse differences in patient characteristics as well
as humanistic and economic burden between individuals with and

without angioedema.

2 | METHODS

2.1 | ASSURE-CSU study design

ASSURE-CSU was an observational, noninterventional, multinational,
multicentre study conducted at urticaria specialty centres in Canada,
France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Methodology’? and overall results‘? have been reported previously. In summary, recruitment of 700 patients was planned. Adult
patients who had a clinician-confirmed CSU diagnosis, had received at
least one treatment course with an H,-antihistamine, had been symptomatic for more than 12 months and were currently symptomatic
despite treatment were eligible’?; patients with urticaria that was predominantly of the inducible form were ineligible. Study data were collected via a retrospective 12-month patient medical record abstraction
(MRA) by physicians, a cross-sectional patient survey and a prospective
8-day patient diary. The appropriate national-, local- and site-level ethical approvals were obtained, and all patients provided written informed

consent. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.*®

2.2 | Study measures

Study measures relevant to this analysis included the occurrence of
angioedema as reported in the physician MRA, the cross-sectional
patient survey and the patient diary. Specifically, physicians reported
from the medical chart whether the patient had angioedema associated with his or her CSU ever, at the time of diagnosis, and/or
within the past 12 months. In the patient survey, completed at
enrolment, patients answered whether they had experienced angioedema ever, during the past 12 months, within the past 4 weeks and/
or currently (at survey completion); patients also answered questions
about the duration and location of angioedema, as well as the symptoms they experienced with angioedema (swelling, itching and pain)
and what they would do to seek treatment (or not) during an angioedema episode. In the Urticaria Patient Daily Diary (UPDD), completed for each of 7 days following enrolment, patients indicated
whether they had experienced “rapid swelling, also called angioedema,” during the past 24 hours.

Additional measures explored in this analysis included demographic data, comorbidities and healthcare resource utilization
(HCRU) related to CSU during the previous 12 months, as abstracted
by physicians in the MRA. Additional measures collected in the
patient survey included validated patient-reported outcome measures such as the Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire
(CU-Q,0L)'*45 and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)*® and

HCRU. The 7-day UPDD?’ also included the twice-daily Urticaria
Activity Score over 7 Days (UAS7;p),!® daily sleep interference and
activity impairment, in addition to the aforementioned occurrence
and management of angioedema. On the 8th day, patients completed the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI), which

has a recall period of 7 days.*?

2.3 | Statistical analysis

Frequency of angioedema within the past 12 months and misalignment of angioedema reporting between physician and patient data
sources were evaluated. For patients in the Yes-angioedema category,
physician and patient data sources agreed that the patient had experienced angioedema. For these cases, the MRA and either the patient
survey or patient diary indicated that the patient had experienced
angioedema in the past 12 months. For patients in the No-angioedema category, physician and patient data sources agreed that the
patient had not experienced angioedema. For these cases, all 3 data
sources indicated no angioedema in the past 12 months. For the Misaligned category, the physician and patient data sources (either
patient survey or diary) did not agree as to whether the patient had
experienced angioedema. For these cases, the physician data source
indicated no angioedema during the past 12 months while one of the
patient sources indicated that angioedema had occurred, or the
physician source indicated that the patient had experienced angioedema in the past 12 months while the patient sources did not. If the
angioedema classification was missing either from the MRA or from
both patient data sources (survey and diary), the patient was assigned
to a Missing category and excluded from analysis.

Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study population by angioedema classification (Yes-angioedema, No-angioedema,
Misaligned). Disease activity was determined by UAS7+7p score bands:
UAS7 tp = 0-6 (urticaria-free or well-controlled urticaria activity), 715 (mild activity), 16-27 (moderate activity) and 28-42 (severe activity).2° Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measures were analysed
by published methodology where available.

Statistical comparisons of patients with and without angioedema
were conducted using t tests or Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous
variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. Tests were
performed between those in the Yes-angioedema and No-angioedema
categories; patients who fell into the Misaligned category were not
included in the statistical comparisons.

Regression modelling was used to explore whether the relationship between DLQI score and angioedema remained significant after
adjusting for important covariates. An analysis of covariance model
was used to evaluate the effect of angioedema on DLQI total score.
Adjustment covariates included UAS7zp score, age, sex, country, disease duration from diagnosis to enrolment and selected comorbidities at enrolment (hypersensitivity to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, Hashimoto's disease and asthma). UAS7+7p score, age and disease duration were treated as continuous variables. Least-squares
mean estimates and standard errors were estimated for each angioe
dema classification; patients in the Méisaligned category were
SUSSMAN Et AL.

 

combined with patients in the Yes-angioedema category for the primary analysis. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted in which the
Misaligned category was excluded from the comparison.

All tests were performed at a nominal significance level of
a =.05 with 2-sided, single degree-of-freedom tests. No correction
was made for multiple comparisons. All analyses were performed
using SAS for Windows statistical software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Initial angioedema frequency over the past
12 months

According to the MRA, physicians reported that 276 of 673 patients
enrolled (41.0%) had experienced CSU-associated angioedema within
the past 12 months, with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) of 19.0
(42.13) angioedema episodes during this period. Among the 649
patients who completed the survey, 427 (65.8%) patients reported
having had angioedema within the past 12 months (Figure 1A).
Among the 614 patients who completed the diary over 1 week,
294 (47.9%) patients reported that they had angioedema at least
1 day; the mean (SD) patient-reported number of days with angioedema was 3.2 (1.92) over the 7 days. The occurrence of angioedema
and number of days with angioedema increased with increasing dis
ease activity over that week.??

3.2 | Postalignment angioedema frequency over the
past 12 months

Of the 673 patients enrolled, 643 patients had recorded data for

assigning the angioedema classification, and 30 patients had missing

data either in the MRA or from both patient data sources (survey
and diary) and could not be classified. Of the 643 patients included
in the angioedema analyses, 276 (42.9%) had angioedema according
to the MRA, and 467 (72.6%) had angioedema according to one of
the patient sources (survey or diary).

For the analyses, 259 patients (40.3%) were in the Yes-angioedema category, 173 (26.9%) were in the No-angioedema category,
and 211 (32.8%) were in the Misaligned category. Of the 211
patients in the Misaligned category, 205 (97.2%) had angioedema
recorded in one of the patient sources (survey or diary) but not in
the MRA (Figure 1B; Table $1).

3.3. | Patient demographics

There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics
between patients in the Yes-angioedema and No-angioedema categories, except in duration of CSU and presence of Hashimoto's disease
(Table 1). Patients in the Yes-angioedema category had longer mean
(SD) duration of disease from diagnosis to enrolment (61.7 [76.64]
months) than those in the No-angioedema category (46.1 [69.06])
(P < .05) and a higher prevalence of Hashimoto's disease (10.4% vs
2.9%; P < .01).

3.4 | Urticaria severity and activity

More patients in the Yes-angioedema category were reported to have
severe CSU activity at diagnosis (37.8%) than those in the No-angioedema category (26.0%) (Table 1). Mean (SD) UAS7+p score reported in
the patient diary was higher for patients in the Yes-angioedema category (17.6 [10.55]) than for those in the No-angioedema category (14.6
[8.97]) (P < .01) (Figure 2). In line with this observation, more patients

in the Yes-angioedema category than in the No-angioedema category

had severe (UAS71p 28-42) disease activity (18.9% vs 12.4%) (Figure $1).? Moreover, a significant difference was observed between
patients in the Yes-angioedema and No-angioedema categories in the
mean (SD) absolute number of hives over a week collected in the
UPDD (147.9 [266.37] vs 77.1 [123.87], respectively).

3.5 | Effect of angioedema on HRQoL, sleep and
daily activities

The mean (SD) CU-Q.,oL score for the overall patient sample was
33.6 (21.02). Mean (SD) CU-Q,OL scores differed significantly

between patients in the Yes-angioedema and No-angioedema categories (37.6 [20.81] vs 23.4 [17.12], P < .001), reflecting significantly
lower HRQoL for patients with angioedema (Figure 3A). Significant
differences were observed between patients with and without
angioedema on all CU-Qzo0L domains.

On the DLQI, mean (SD) overall score for the entire sample was
9.1 (6.63) and for Yes-angioedema and No-angioedema groups were
10.4 (6.85) and 6.6 (5.21), respectively (P < .001) (Figure 3B). Again,
significant differences were observed between patients with and
without angioedema on all DLQI domains (Figure 3C). More patients

category (20.4%) had DLQI scores >10 (indicating a very to extremely large effect on HRQoL??).

As patients reported on the UPDD, mean (SD) weekly scores for
interference with sleep were higher for patients in the Yes-angioedema category (6.9 [6.14]) than for patients in the No-angioedema
category (4.6 [4.92]) (P < .001), as were mean (SD) weekly scores for
interference with daily activities (6.5 [5.68] vs 4.8 [4.39]; P < .05)
(Figure 3D). Activity impairment measured by the mean percentage
overall activity impairment score on the WPAI was also greater for
patients in the Yes-angioedema category than for patients in the Noangioedema category (34.5% vs 23.8%; P < .001) (Figure 4).

3.6 | Economic and societal impact of angioedema

Patients in the Yes-angioedema category had greater HCRU, both
documented in medical records and self-reported, than patients in
the No-angioedema category (Table $2). According to the MRA,
patients in the Yes-angioedema category were more likely to have a
CSU-related emergency department visit than patients in the Noangioedema category (24.7% vs 5.2%, P < .001) and were more likely
to have one or more inpatient hospital stays in the past 12 months
(11.6% vs 3.5%, P < .01). As reported in the patient diary, patients
with angioedema were more likely to call a healthcare provider during the 7-day window than patients without angioedema (7.3% vs
0.6%, P < .01).

Impact on work was greater among patients in the Yes-angioedema category than among patients in the No-angioedema category.

Patients in the Yes-angioedema category who completed the diary

 

were more likely to have missed 1 or more hours of work in the 7day diary window than patients in the No-angioedema category
(27.6% vs 5.8%, P < .001), and mean (SD) number of days of work
missed in the past 3 months was significantly higher for patients in
the Yes-angioedema versus the No-angioedema category (4.7 [11.64])
vs 0.8 [3.86], P < .001). WPAI scores showed significantly greater
absenteeism among patients in the Yes-angioedema versus No-angioedema categories (mean [SD] percentage absenteeism: 9.1% [23.22%]
vs 1.4% [9.08%], P < .001), as well as significantly greater overall
work impairment (mean [SD] percentage overall work impairment:
29.2% [28.48%) vs 19.1% [21.37%], P = .02) (Figure 4). Overall,
angioedema was the second most common reason for missing work,

after itching.

3.7 | Characteristics of the misaligned angioedema
category

Patients in the Misaligned category were compared descriptively with
patients in the Yes-angioedema and No-angioedema categories and
were found to be most similar to patients in the Yes-angioedema category in all outcomes. Demographics were similar in terms of age,
sex, disease duration from diagnosis to enrolment and CSU severity
at diagnosis (Table 1). Similar proportions of patients in the Misaligned and Yes-angioedema categories had moderate (UAS71p 16-27)
or severe (UAS71p 28-42) disease activity (56.4% and 52.5%, respectively). When completing the survey, 52.2% of patients in the Misaligned category reported that their angioedema typically lasts more
than 12 hours, compared with 47.8% of patients in the Yes-angioedema category. The mean (SD) amount of swelling, on a scale of O
to 10, was similar for patients in the Misaligned category (7.1 [2.12])
and those in the Yes-angioedema category (7.2 [2.20]). In addition,
the HRQoL impact of CSU was similar for patients in the Misaligned
and Yes-angioedema categories, as indicated by mean (SD) overall
scores on the DLQI (10.4 [6.85] and 9.7 [6.87], respectively) and
CU-QzoL (37.6 [20.81] and 37.0 [21.49], respectively) (Figure 3A,B).
Percentage overall work impairment due to CSU was similar for
patients in the Misaligned and Yes-angioedema categories (mean
[SD] = 31.5% [29.99%] and 29.2% (28.48%), respectively) (Figure 4).

3.8 | DLQI regression analysis

Given the similarities in characteristics and outcomes among patients
in the Misaligned and Yes-angioedema categories, the Misaligned
patients were combined with the Yes-angioedema patients in the primary regression analysis of DLQI total score. After covariate adjustment, mean DLQI score was significantly higher for patients with
angioedema versus without (9.88 vs 7.27, P< .001) (Table 2).
Results were similar in the sensitivity analysis in which patients in
the Misaligned angioedema category were excluded: mean DLQI total
score was significantly higher for patients with angioedema versus
without (9.69 vs 6.73, P < .001).

4 | DISCUSSION

The results of this post hoc analysis revealed notable differences in
reporting of angioedema between CSU patients and physicians in
the ASSURE-CSU study. The objective of this analysis was to align
angioedema data in order to better estimate the actual rate of
angioedema and to analyse differences between patients with and
without angioedema. Angioedema was more frequently reported by
patients than by physicians: 65.8% of patients who completed the
survey reported having experienced angioedema during the past
12 months, whereas physicians reported that 41.0% of patients had
experienced angioedema during the same time period. A large majority (97%) of patients with misaligned angioedema data did not have
physician-reported angioedema but reported having experienced
angioedema in either the patient survey or diary. These findings suggest that the occurrence of angioedema may be under-recognized
among physicians (who may not routinely ask patients about angioedema symptoms), that patients may not always report their angioedema symptoms to physicians or that patients characterize some
CSU-related swelling as angioedema when a physician would classify
it as hives or sometimes as swelling unrelated to urticaria.

ASSURE-CSU patients with misaligned angioedema data appear
most similar to patients with angioedema, in terms of disease duration;
disease activity; and scores on patient-reported outcome measures
including the CU-Q.oL, DLQI and WPAI. If patients in the Misaligned
category were reclassified into the Yes-angioedema category, which
they closely resembled, the percentage of patients in the ASSURE-CSU
study with angioedema over 12 months would increase from 40.3% to
73.1%. Moreover, our analysis suggests that patients with more severe
CSU are more likely to have angioedema. Physicians reported that more
patients with angioedema than without had severe CSU at diagnosis,
and patients with angioedema reported greater CSU activity as indicated by UAS7+p mean score than those without angioedema.

The primary ASSURE-CSU analysis found that angioedema had a
significant impact on HRQoL in patients with CSU, particularly with
respect to emotional well-being, fatigue and mood.’? The current
analysis also revealed the considerable impact of angioedema on
HRQoL, as indicated by CU-Q,oL and DLQI scores, and its additional
negative impact on top of itch and hives. Even after controlling for
other factors, angioedema has a significant effect on the DLQI total
score. In addition, patients with angioedema have additional impairment on work productivity and more HCRU than those without it,
indicating that angioedema further contributes to the economic bur
den of inadequately controlled CSU.

Taken together, findings from these analyses suggest that
physicians should ensure that patients understand the manifestations of angioedema and should routinely assess patients with
CSU for presence of angioedema, which may enable more accurate estimates of the true prevalence and burden of angioedema.
Appropriate tools available for evaluating angioedema activity and
its impact on CSU patients’ lives should be used regularly in clini
22-24

cal practice. In patients with recurrent angioedema, CSU

should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses.t?>
Additionally, angioedema in CSU should prompt adequate treatment. The development of new treatments specifically for CSU
has been shown to prevent angioedema and improve angioedemadependent and dermatology-related quality of life.”?°?° Future
research should explore the clinical course of angioedema in CSU
—including the most commonly affected areas, the clinical differences compared with hereditary angioedema and evolution of
symptoms over time—as well as the distinct management patterns
that patients with angioedema in CSU require. Understanding the
underlying mechanisms of angioedema in CSU?? and exploring differences in the general categories of angioedema (ie mast cell-induced and bradykinin-induced) are also important areas for
additional research.

Several limitations must be considered when the results of this
study are interpreted. First, the study was conducted in specialized
centres only, and physicians and centres were not selected systematically, owing to the small number of specialist units for this population. The resulting sample is not guaranteed to be representative of
all medical settings and physicians treating patients with CSU. Second, the target population had had CSU for at least 12 months and
had not responded adequately to treatment at the time of inclusion
in the study; thus, the study does not reflect the entire population
of patients with CSU but more patients with inadequately controlled
CSU. Moreover, although patients received training about identifying
angioedema and reporting it in the patient survey or diary, like all
patient-reported data, angioedema was still subject to patients’ individual interpretation of the symptom description and manifestation.
In addition, data extracted by physicians from medical records were

not independently validated.

5 | CONCLUSIONS

Among this study population with inadequately controlled CSU,
40.3% had confirmed angioedema in the past 12 months, and 32.8%

of patients had misaligned angioedema data (ie the majority reporting
having experienced angioedema in the past 12 months without having it documented in their medical records). This suggests that a
higher proportion of patients with inadequately controlled symptomatic CSU might have angioedema than previously thought.
Patients with angioedema reported statistically significantly worse
HRQoL and higher societal burden than patients without angioedema; patients in the Misaligned group reported similar impairment
as patients with confirmed angioedema. Overall, the study found that

angioedema has an incremental impact on societal and humanistic

outcomes in CSU patients. These findings suggest the need for
improved physician-patient communication regarding angioedema for

better symptom control in patients with inadequately controlled CSU.
