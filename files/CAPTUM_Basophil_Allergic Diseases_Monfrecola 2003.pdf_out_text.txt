ABSTRACT

Background As long-wave ultraviolet (UV) radiation penetrates the dermis, connective tissue cellular components and circulating blood cells can be possible targets for solar UVA. Basophils, involved in the effector phase
of the inflammatory response, play a part in skin diseases such as chronic urticaria, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis,
fixed drug eruption, allergic contact dermatitis, urticaria pigmentosa, systemic sclerosis and bullous pemphigoid.
Objective The evaluation of the in vitro effect of UVA on histamine release from human basophils.
Methods Basophils from healthy human volunteers were irradiated, respectively, with UVA at doses of
2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 20 and 50 J/cm? and then incubated with an anti-IgE serum. A fluorimetric technique was
employed to determine histamine release from samples: (i) incubated with 2% HClO, (complete lysis of
basophils); (ii) irradiated with increasing doses of UVA; and (iii) unirradiated (controls).

Results Histamine release was: 100% for HCIO, incubated basophils, 30% for unirradiated and anti-IgE
incubated cells (controls) and 27%, 24%, 34%, 41%, 60% and 70% for basophils irradiated with UVA doses,
respectively, of 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 20 and 50 J/cm? and incubated with anti-IgE. Histamine releasability from
irradiated samples was statistically significant (P < 0.05), in comparison with controls, at UVA doses equal
to 5, 10, 20 and 50 J/cm2.

Conclusions UVA exerts, at least in vitro, a biphasic dose-dependent action on histamine release from
human basophils incubated with an anti-IgE serum: at the lowest irradiation doses (< 5 J/cm?) it exerts an
inhibitory effect and at the highest doses (2 10 J/cm?) histamine release increases significantly.

Introduction

Exposure to long-wave ultraviolet (UV) radiation (UVA =
320-400 nm) has long been considered not to be a risk for
human skin because the dose required to elicit erythema is
about 1000 times larger than that needed to induce an identical
reaction with UVB (290-320 nm). During the last decade a
number of papers have been published showing that UVA can
exert action on multiple skin components such as cell membranes and cytoskeleton;! moreover, it can cause photoageing
and _photocarcinogenesis,2_ probably mediated by cellular
chromophores absorbing long-wave UV.

Regarding the weight of UVA on human skin it is important
to consider that: (i) the amount of this waveband reaching the

646

Earth’s surface is 20 times greater than that of UVB; (ii) the percentage of UVA, compared with that of short-wave UV, is
greater during the morning or afternoon hours; and (iii) many
people expose their skin to large amounts of artificial UVA for
cosmetic purposes.

In mammals exposure to UVA radiation induces immunomodulation, although its effects are at the moment less defined and
are more controversial than those of UVB.; It is well established
that UVA causes the production of immunomodulatory cytokines
in keratinocytes! and fibroblasts;> moreover, it affects several
immunologically relevant epidermal and dermal cells such as
Langerhans cells, T lymphocytes, natural killer cells and mast cells.3

At the moment no data are available about the possible
effects of UVA on other cells involved in the inflammatory

response, such as basophils, which, together with eosinophils,
are involved in the effector phase of allergic inflammation.
After their release from the bone marrow, basophils circulate in
the blood and normally are not found in human tissues. However,
there is no increasing evidence that basophils are involved in
hypersensitivity reactions in inflammed tissues.6 The fact that
basophils migrate in the tissues (including the dermis) and that
long-wave UV rays can penetrate the skin up to the dermis,
prompted us to evaluate whether UVA could, in vitro, exert an
action on histamine release from human basophils.

Materials and methods

Buffers

PIPES [piperazine — N,N’-bis(2-ethanesulphonic acid)] buffer
was made up of 25mm PIPES (pH 7.4), 110 mm NaCl and
5 mm KCl, and PCG contained 1.0 mm CaCl, and 0.1%
p-glucose in addition to PIPES; pH was titrated to 7.4 with
NaOH. Phosphate-buffered saline contained (in g/L): NaCl,
8.0; Na, HPO,-7H,0, 2.89; KH,PO,, 0.2 and KCl, 0.2 (pH 7.3).
Anti-IgE was generously provided by Drs T. and K. Ishizaka (La
Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla, CA).

Preparation of peripheral blood leucocytes containing
basophils and basophil enrichment

 

The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee for
Human Research of the School of Medicine of the University of
Naples Federico II. Informed consent was obtained from eight
healthy volunteers aged 16-58 years (mean age 32.3 + 0.9
years), and venous blood was drawn into a final concentration
of 0.008 m ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and 1.1% Dextran
70. Erythrocytes were allowed to settle for 90 min at 22 °C. The
leucocyte-rich upper layer was drawn off, pelleted (200 xg,
8 min, 4 °C) and washed twice in PIPES as previously described.7
This preparation, generally containing about 0.5% basophils, is

 

referred to in this paper as ‘basophils. Contaminating cells
were lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes and
platelets. Basophil-enriched preparations were obtained by
a modification of the method described by De Boer and Roos.’
In brief, buffy coat cell packs from healthy volunteers were
reconstituted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 g/L
human serum albumin and 3.42 g/L Na citrate and loaded on
to a countercurrent elutriator (model J2—21, Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA). Several fractions were collected,
and fractions containing large numbers of basophils (> 15%)
were further enriched by discontinuous Percoll gradients.?
Basophils were further purified to near homogeneity (> 98%)
by depleting B cells, monocytes, natural killer cells, dendritic
cells, erythrocytes, platelet, neutrophils, eosinophils and T cells
using a cocktail of hapten-conjugated CD3, CD7, CD14, CD15,
CD16, CD36, CD45RA and anti-HLA-DR antibodies and

MACS MicroBeads coupled to an antihapten monoclonal
antibody. The magnetically labelled cells are depleted by
retaining them on a MACS column in a magnetic field of the
MidiMACS (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany).
Yields ranged from 3 to 10 x 106 basophils, with purity usually
> 98%, as assessed by basophils staining with alcian blue and
counting in a Spiers—Levy eosinophil counter.!°

Ultraviolet A source and irradiation

A bank of six fluorescent tubes (Philips TL09, 40 W) whose
emission spectrum was between 315 and 400nm (peak:
355 nm) was used. The irradiance was measured before each
irradiation session by an UVAmeter (Spectrolyne mod, DM365H, Spectronics Corporation, Westbury, NY, USA). Samples
from each of the eight volunteers were irradiated in plastic
dishes (at a distance of 20 cm from the fluorescent tubes) with the
following UVA doses: 2.5 J/cm2, 5 J/cm?, 7.5 J/cm?, 10 J/cm?,
20 J/cm? and 50 J/cm?. To eliminate the wavelengths below
320 nm, irradiations were applied through a 5-mm thick
window.

Histamine release assay

Aliquots of 0.4 mL of the cell suspensions in PCG, containing
approximately 5 x 104 basophils per tube, were placed in plastic
dishes and warmed to 37 °C. Prewarmed aliquots (0.1 mL)
of anti-IgE (10-! g/mL) were added and incubation was
continued at 37 °C for 45 min. The reaction was stopped by
centrifugation (1000 x g, 2 min, 22 °C), and the cell free
supernatants were stored at —20 °C for the subsequent assay
of histamine. Histamine was assayed with an automated
fluorimetric technique.!! The total histamine content was
assessed by lysis induced by incubating cells with 2% HClO,
before centrifugation. In order to calculate histamine release
as a percentage of total cellular histamine, the spontaneous
release of histamine from basophils was subtracted from both
numerator and denominator. All values are based on means
of duplicate samples in which the histamine content differed
by less than 10%. The anti-IgE used throughout the study
was a portion from a single stock that had been stored at
20°C.

Statistical analysis

The results obtained were graphically represented by means
of histograms. The increasing UVA doses employed in our
experiments were plotted against the corresponding percentage of histamine release induced by UVA. The results are
mean + SEM. The significance of the difference in the effect of
increasing UVA doses and controls was determined by statistical
tests including the paired Student's f-test.!2 Differences were
considered significant at P < 0.05.

mean + SEM of histamine release (%), from samples coming from eight

U.S. = unirradiated samples.

Results

Figure 1 shows the percentage of histamine release from human
basophils stimulated with anti-IgE. The first histogram
represents the percentage of histamine release from cells only
incubated with anti-IgE, without UVA exposure (controls). In
this case histamine release was equal to 30% if compared with
100% (not shown in the figure) obtained after the complete
lysis of basophils with HCIO, and consequent release of all
the preformed mediator (histamine) contained into the
cytoplasmatic granules.

The second and third histograms represent the percentage
of histamine release from basophils irradiated with UVA doses
equal, respectively, to 2.5 J/cm? and 5 J/cm2, before incubation

with anti-IgE. In both cases we observed a decrease of histamine
release, respectively, to 27% and 24%, in comparison with 30%
from unirradiated and anti-IgE stimulated cells (controls).

Histograms from fourth to seventh represent the percentage of
histamine release from basophils irradiated with UVA doses equal
to 7.5 J/cm2, 10 J/cm2, 20 J/cm? and 50 J/cm2. In this case UVA
exposure enhanced histamine release, respectively, to 34%, 41%,
60% and 70%, always in comparison with unirradiated samples.

In summary, at lowest irradiative doses (2.5 J/cm? and
5 J/cm?) histamine release from basophils stimulated with antiIgE is inhibited. In particular, at 2.5 J/cm? the release is reduced
(27%), but not significantly, whereas a statistically significant
inhibitory effect (P < 0.05) occurs at 5 J/cm?, with a reduction of
the mediator release to 24%. On the contrary, a dose-dependent
histamine release was observed at higher UVA doses; in this
case the differences with the release from unirradiated samples
are significant (P < 0.05) for basophils irradiated, respectively,
with doses of 10 J/cm2, 20 J/cm? and 50 J/cm? (fig. 1).

Each histogram in the figure represents the mean + SEM of
histamine release from eight volunteers; on the contrary Table 1
reports data obtained from each of the eight volunteers. The
columns of the table show the different experimental conditions in which basophils from eight volunteers were studied:
unirradiated (only incubated with anti-IgE) and irradiated
cells (with UVA doses equal to 2.5 J/cm2, 5 J/cm?, 7.5 J/cm?,
10 J/cm?, 20 J/cm? and 50 J/cm2) before immunological activation. On the contrary, each bar of the table shows the results
(% of histamine release) obtained from each of the eight volunteers.

In the last bar the mean + SEM of histamine release from the
eight volunteers are shown; such values are graphically reported
by means of histograms in fig. 1.

Discussion

This present study demonstrates that, in vitro, UVA can exert a
biphasic dose-dependent action on histamine release from

human basophils incubated with an anti-IgE serum. At the
lowest irradiation doses UVA induces an inhibitory effect and
the reduction of histamine release is significant (P < 0.05%)
when basophils are irradiated with 5 J/cm2. Histamine release
is nearly like the control after an UVA irradiation of 7.5 J/cm2,
but it increases in a significant way (P < 0.05%) at doses of 10,
20 and 50 J/cm2.

The explanation of this phenomenon could reside in the
human basophil structure and physiology® and on the UVA
effects on cell membranes. Basophils contain round cytoplasmatic granules with a diameter up to 1.2 Um containing histamine, major basic protein, Charcot—Leyden crystal protein,
FceRI subunits, interleukins 4 and 8, and RANTES (regulated
upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted). Histamine is stored at about 1—2 pg per cell. The release of histamine
can be induced via cross-linking of IgE bound to FceRI receptors on cell membranes; other releasing stimuli are the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, some leucocyte products such as the
so-called histamine-releasing factors, and the chemotactic
tripeptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine.

FceRI is made of four subunits: one o chain, one B chain and
two identical disulphide linked y chains. The o and the dimeric
y chains are maintained as a complex in the plasma membrane
through a combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic noncovalent interactions. The extracellular domain of « chain is
necessary and sufficient to provide the receptor with highaffinity IgE binding. The B chain crosses the plasma membrane
four times and has two intracellular tails. The two y chains associate through a disulphide bond. They have a very short extracellular part, a transmembrane part and a cytoplasmatic tail.
Both B and y chains are involved in signal transduction. The
initiation of signalling requires receptor clustering that is
induced, in our experiments, by anti-IgE antibodies.

The earliest events following receptor cross-linking are

 

receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, which is detectable within a
15-30-s period. Thereafter, activation of the sky and Btk tyrosine kinase begins, concomitantly with calcium mobilization.
When FceRI is clustered on basophils, release of secretory
granule contents and synthesis and release of arachidonic acid
metabolites begin within 30—60 min. It is now well established
that activating signals after cross-linking of antigen receptors
involve 18 amino acid homologous motifs found in the cytoplasmatic tails of FceRI. These motifs become tyrosine phosphorylated by src family kinases when receptors are engaged by
clustering antigens, resulting in the recruitment to the engaged
receptors of both sre and syk/zap 70 family non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Downstream propagation of the activation signal
is mediated by activation of these tyrosine kinases and the
resulting phosphorylation of specific substrates.

It has been demonstrated?.!3.!4 that damaging effects of UVA
are mainly due to the generation of reactive oxygen species. In
particular, single oxygen and hydroxyl radicals are involved in
lipid peroxidation that occurs in cultured human fibroblasts

ina dose-related fashion;}!5 the lipid peroxidation caused by UVA
irradiation, damaging cell membranes, induces a decrease of
membrane fluidity.! It is interesting to note that UVB is 10-100
times more active than UVA regarding lipid peroxidation,
whereas, the efficiency of short-wave UV regarding other biological effects (ie. erythema) is about 1000 times that of longwave UV. Considering the amounts of UVA (20 times more
than that of UVB) reaching the Earth’s surface, there is no doubt
that wavelengths between 320 and 400 nm can play an important
art in cell membrane damage via lipid peroxidation.

UVA doses less than 7.5 J/cm? could stabilize the cytolasmic or granular membranes of basophils or block/
modify the degranulating chemical signals giving rise to an
inhibitory effect on the histamine release. The increase of the
ercentage of histamine release observed with the highest UVA
doses could be ascribed to a marked dose-dependent damage of

 

basophils cell membranes starting from 7.5 J/cm2. This observation is in agreement with data reported from Skoog et al.16
who, using the application of fluorescein diacetate as an indicator, demonstrated that UVA causes damage of cultured human
fibroblast plasma membranes with doses between 4 and
8 J/cm2. The same authors reported that the membranes were
damaged by the lipid peroxidation as evidenced by the accumulation of malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxyalkenals.

‘Two days after the basophils have reached their mature morphology, they are released from the bone marrow into the blood
and then move into the tissues, including the dermis, where
they probably survive up to several weeks. As the quantity of
transmitted UVA through fair Caucasian epidermis ranges
from 10 to 50% of the irradiation dose,!7-!9 both circulating
and dermal cells can be possible targets of long-wave UV.

 

Therefore it is likely that, also in vivo, basophils can be influenced by longer wavelengths of the UV solar spectrum. Moseley
et al.,2° measuring the daylight UVA in Glasgow from 1980 to
1982, found UVA daily energy densities ranging from 4 J/cm?
in December to an average of 69 J/cm? in June. Measurements
of daily ambient UVA in Durham (UK; latitude 55°N) detected
by Diffey in 19942! show a summer to winter ratio of about
10: 1 with doses ranging from 70 to 150 J/cm? in the period
between May and September. Obviously these values were
affected by climatic variations such as clouds. The same author,
using a questionnaire administered to 120 adults, has estimated
that the daily solar UVA dose in British indoor workers ranges
between 1 and 10 J/cm? on about half a year. However remarkable,
these quantities are several times lower than those reached in
sunny climates; therefore, it is likely that the histamine release
of basophils of Caucasian people, living for instance in the
Mediterranean area or in Australia, could be influenced during
sun exposure in the summertime.

In the same way, histamine release from basophils could be
affected by the use of sunbeds as the commercial UV tanning
equipment emits between 7 and 20 mW/cm2 (mean 13.5 mW/
cm2) of UVA;22 this means that, after a tanning session lasting

650 Monfrecola et al.

 

20 min, the skin receives between 8 and 24 J/cm2. Taking into
account that 50% of the incident UVA is transmitted through
the Caucasian epidermis,? we can infer that during a tanning
session the dermal or circulating basophils could be irradiated
with UVA doses ranging from 4 to 12 J/cm?.

Basophils and mast cells, the only human cells that contain
histamine and have high-affinity receptors for the Fc portion of
IgE, are both involved in different phases of anaphylactic
reactions. During the immediate phase, mast cells release histamine, eicosanoids and other chemotactic factors that attract
basophils, eosinophils and neutrophils. These cells, present in
the cellular infiltrate of the chronic allergic inflammation, are
responsible for the late phase of the anaphylactic response.

Several studies have shown that basophils play a part in
skin diseases such as psoriasis,?3 atopic dermatitis,?4 urticaria
pigmentosa,?5 allergic contact dermatitis,2° fixed drug
eruption,27 chronic urticaria,?8 systemic sclerosis?? and bullous
pemphigoid.

Considering the large amounts of UVA in the solar spectrum
or in the artificial UV sources of sunbeds our results, showing
that in vitro long-wave UV at low doses inhibits and at high
doses enhances the histamine release from basophils, could
add useful data to explain the anti-inflammatory or the proinflammatory effects observed in vivo after UV irradiation of
the intact or unhealthy skin.
