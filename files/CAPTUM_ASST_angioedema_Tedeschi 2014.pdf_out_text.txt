@ Abstract

Background: The pathophysiology and triggers of idiopathic nonhistaminergic angioedema are unclear. This study aimed to assess
autoreactivity in recurrent idiopathic angioedema associated or not with wheals.

Methods: The study population comprised 19 patients with recurrent idiopathic nonhistaminergic angioedema without wheals, 38 patients with
angioedema and chronic urticaria (CU), and 52 patients with CU without angioedema. Twenty healthy individuals served as controls. Autoreactivity
was evaluated in vivo using the autologous serum skin test (ASST) and in vitro by measuring serum-induced basophil histamine release (BHR).
Results: ASST results were negative in all patients with idiopathic angioedema without wheals and in healthy controls and positive in 29 of the
38 patients with angioedema and CU (76.3%) and in 26 of the 52 patients with CU without angioedema (50%) (P<.0001 for both CU groups).
BHR was negative in the healthy controls and positive in 2 of the 19 patients with idiopathic angioedema without wheals (10.5%), in 18 of
the 38 patients with angioedema and CU (47.3%) (P<.0001), and in 11 of the 52 patients with CU without angioedema (21.1%) (P<.03).
Conclusion: The different rates of autoreactivity observed in patients with idiopathic nonhistaminergic angioedema without wheals and in
patients with CU either with or without angioedema suggest that these disorders have a different pathophysiology. The failure to detect
circulating vasoactive factors and histamine-releasing autoantibodies explains why H; antihistamines are scarcely effective in most patients
with idiopathic angioedema without wheals. However, they represent the cornerstone of CU treatment.

™@ Resumen

Antecedentes: Se desconocen la fisiopatologia y los desencadenantes del angioedema idiopatico no histaminérgico. El objetivo de este
estudio fue evaluar la autorreactividad en el angioedema idiopatico recurrente asociado o no a la presencia de habones.

Métodos: La poblacion en estudio incluy a 19 pacientes con angioedema idiopatico no histaminérgico recurrente sin presencia de habones,
a 38 pacientes con angioedema y urticaria cronica (UC), y a 52 pacientes con UC sin angioedema. Veinte individuos sanos sirvieron como
controles. Se evalud la autorreactividad in vivo mediante la prueba cutanea con suero autdlogo (PCSA) e in vitro mediante la determinacion
de la liberacién de histamina de basofilos (LHB) inducida por suero.

Resultados: Los resultados de la PCSA fueron negativos en todos los pacientes con angioedema idiopatico sin presencia de habones y en los
controles sanos, y positivos en 29 de los 38 pacientes con angioedema y UC (76,3%) y en 26 de los 52 pacientes con CU sin angioedema
(50%) (9 <0,0001 para ambos grupos con UC). Los resultados de la LHB fueron negativos en los controles sanos y positivos en 2 de los
19 pacientes con angioedema idiopatico sin presencia de habones (10,5%), en 18 de los 38 pacientes con angioedema y UC (47,3%)
(p<0,0001), y en 11 de los 52 pacientes con UC sin angioedema (21,1%) (0 < 0,03).

Conclusion: Los diferentes indices de autorreactividad que se observaron en pacientes con angioedema idiopatico no histaminérgico sin
presencia de habones y en pacientes con UC con o sin angioedema permiten suponer que estos trastornos tienen una fisiopatologia
distinta. El hecho de que no se detectaran factores vasoactivos circulantes y autoanticuerpos liberadores de histamina explica por qué
los antihistaminicos H; resultan apenas eficaces en la mayoria de pacientes con angioedema idiopatico sin presencia de habones y, sin
embargo, representan la piedra angular del tratamiento de la UC.

Autoreactivity in Idiopathic Angioedema and Urticaria 88

 

Introduction

Angioedema is a self-limiting localized swelling that
involves subcutaneous and submucosal tissues and is
generally not associated with changes in skin color, burning
sensation, or itchiness. It is thought to result from a local
increase in the permeability of subcutaneous and submucosal
capillaries and postcapillary venules in response to mediators
such as histamine and bradykinin [1,2]. In most patients,
angioedema occurs with wheals, is largely histaminergic,
and responds to antiallergic drugs such as H, antihistamines
and corticosteroids [3-5]. The most common form is allergic
angioedema, which is generally due to allergy to food, drugs,
and insect venom [3]. Immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated
mast cell degranulation with subsequent histamine release is
considered to underlie the disorder in most cases. However,
the pathophysiology of recurrent angioedema with urticaria
may also be linked to an autoimmune process leading to
mast cell degranulation. Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CU),
which is associated with angioedema in about 30% of cases,
is now recognized as an autoimmune disease associated with
histamine-releasing autoantibodies in a consistent proportion
of patients [6]. Substantial advances in our understanding of
the pathogenesis of this disease have been made during the
last 2 decades, following the observation by Grattan et al [7]
that intradermal injection of autologous serum (autologous
serum skin test [ASST]) caused a wheal-and-flare reaction
in about 50% of CU patients. The main factors inducing skin
reactivity to autologous serum were subsequently identified
as autoantibodies directed against the @ subunit of the high
affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) or against IgE [8,9]. These
findings led to the interpretation of CU as an autoimmune
disorder produced by histamine-releasing autoantibodies in
about 40% of patients. In contrast to angioedema occurring in
the context of an allergic reaction or CU, the pathophysiology
of recurrent idiopathic angioedema without urticaria remains
unclear. Although bradykinin is known to play a major role
in the pathophysiology of angioedema caused by hereditary
or acquired Cl-inhibitor deficiency and treatment with
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, the mediators
involved in idiopathic nonhistaminergic angioedema and
related factors acting as triggers or enhancers of vascular
permeability remain unclear [2,10,11].

The aim of this study was to assess autoreactivity in patients
with idiopathic recurrent angioedema associated or not with
urticaria. Autoreactivity was evaluated in vivo using the ASST
and in vitro by measuring serum-induced basophil histamine
release (BHR).

Patients and Methods

The study population comprised 19 patients with recurrent
idiopathic angioedema without wheals (13 males and 6
females; median age, 45 [range, 27-78] years), 38 patients
with angioedema and CU (8 males and 30 females; median
age, 40.5 [range, 14-76 | years), and 52 patients with CU
without angioedema (16 males and 36 females; median age,

37.5 [range, 18-81] years), all of whom were evaluated at the
allergy center of Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico in Milano,
Italy. Twenty healthy individuals (11 males and 9 females;
median age, 40.5 [range, 26-65] years) were selected as
controls. CU was diagnosed on the basis of the recurrence of
spontaneous wheals for more than 6 weeks. Physical urticaria
and other possible causes of urticaria (ie, food and drug allergy
and parasitosis) were ruled out after appropriate investigations.
Only patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria were selected
for the study, whereas patients with physical urticaria and
urticaria vasculitis were excluded.

At the first visit, based on patients’ recent history and
according to the number of wheals and degree of pruritus
present, disease activity was estimated following the urticaria
activity score (UAS), as recommended in the recent guidelines
of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology
[12]. According to the UAS, urticaria was classified as mild
(score 1), moderate (score 2), or severe (score 3). All patients
had active urticaria with or without angioedema at the time
of the study.

Patients with idiopathic angioedema without wheals
reported a history of recurrent angioedema involving different
sites and organs (mostly affecting the face [including lips
and eyelids], hands, feet, and genital area) that was not
accompanied by urticaria and was not triggered by identified
external agents including drugs, foods, or hymenoptera venom.
None of the patients had a family history of angioedema or was
taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Functional
Cl-inhibitor levels, measured using a commercial reagent kit
(Immuno), and antigenic Cl-inhibitor levels, assayed using
radial immunodiffusion (Dade Behring), were normal in all
cases, as were serum levels of the complement fractions C3
and C4. In all patients, treatment with H; antihistamines at
the licensed doses had failed to prevent angioedema episodes.

The intradermal ASST was performed with 0.05 mL
of fresh autologous serum at least 5 days after stopping
antihistamine therapy (cetirizine, levocetirizine, loratadine,
desloratadine, or ebastine in all cases) according to the method
of Sabroe et al [13], with reading of the wheal-and-flare
reaction at 30 minutes. Intradermal injection of saline solution
(0.9% wt/vol) was performed as a negative control and skin
prick test with 10 mg/mL of histamine as a positive control.
Patients showing a red wheal with a diameter at least 1.5 mm
greater than that of the control saline solution were considered
positive. At the time of blood sampling, none of the patients
had associated chronic inflammatory disorders, hepatitis C,
ora history of recent acute infectious disease. All participants
gave their informed consent to undergo ASST and peripheral
blood collection for in vitro assays.

Basophil Histamine Release Assay

Leukocyte suspensions from healthy blood donors were
prepared by dextran sedimentation of peripheral venous blood
anticoagulated with 0.01 M EDTA and mixed with 6% dextran
in saline solution (Plander 70, Fresenius Kabi Italia) and 30
mM dextrose (Sigma Chemicals). The cells were allowed to
settle for 60-90 minutes at room temperature, the leukocyterich plasma was aspirated and centrifuged at 300g for 15

minutes at 4°C, and the cell button was washed twice in
Tyrode buffer (pH, 7.4) containing (mM) 140 NaCl, 5.5
dextrose, 2.7 KCI, 0.36 NaH:PO,, and 12 NaHCO;. Leukocytes
(with about 7 x 10* basophils) were resuspended in 100 wL of
Tyrode buffer with 1.8 mM CaCl, and 0.5 mM MgCl2 and
incubated with 100 uL of the serum under examination, making
a final volume of 200 uL. After incubation for 40 minutes at
37°C, the reaction was stopped by addition of 800 wL of icecold buffer solution and centrifugation at 1000g for 10 minutes
at 4°C. The supernatants were then aspirated, mixed with an
equal volume of 6% HCIO, and centrifuged again at 1000g
for 10 minutes at 4°C. The histamine concentration in the
supernatants was measured using an automated fluorometric
method [14]. Spontaneous histamine release was evaluated by
measuring the histamine concentration in the supernatant o:
nonstimulated cells incubated for 40 minutes at 37°C. Total
histamine content was obtained by adding 100 uL of 6%
HCIO, to 100 wL of cell suspension. Net histamine release
was calculated as the percentage of total histamine content
after subtraction of spontaneous release. A 5% release cutof!
value was used, as previously described [15]. Sera were
tested with leukocyte suspensions from a normal donor whose
basophils were previously shown to release 30% of total
histamine content on challenge with an optimal dose of goat
polyclonal antihuman IgE (Sigma Chemicals; 10 ug/mL). In
order to detect the presence of functionally active anti-FceRI
autoantibodies, basophil histamine release was also evaluated
after stripping membrane-bound IgE with 10 mmol/L of lactic
acid (pH, 3.9; incubation for 3.5 minutes at room temperature),

 

found for sex distribution, namely, a predominance of
males among patients with idiopathic angioedema without
wheals (68.4%) and a minority of males among patients
with angioedema and CU (21%, P=.001) and among patients
with CU without angioedema (30.7%, P=.018) (Table 1).
The ASST result was negative in all healthy controls and in
patients with idiopathic nonhistaminergic angioedema without
urticaria; conversely, it was positive in 29 out of 38 patients
with angioedema and CU (76.3%) and in 26 out of 52 patients
with CU without angioedema (50%). ASST positivity was
significantly associated with CU with or without angioedema
in comparison to patients with idiopathic angioedema without
wheals (P<.0001 for both patient groups, relative risk, 3.22 for
CU with angioedema and 1.76 for CU without angioedema);
furthermore, percentage positivity was higher in patients
with CU and angioedema than in patients with CU without
angioedema (P=.015). BHR was positive in 2 out of 19 patients
with idiopathic angioedema without wheals (10.5%), in 18 out
of 38 patients with angioedema and CU (47.3%) (P<.0001
vs healthy controls, relative risk 2.0; P=.007 vs angioedema
patients), and in 11 patients out of 52 with CU without
angioedema (21.1%) (P<.03 vs healthy controls; relative risk,
1.48) (Table 2). The results of histamine release are reported
in the Figure and show a significant difference between the 4
groups (P=.0001). BHR was positive only after stripping of
basophil membrane-bound IgE with lactic acid in | patient with
angioedema without wheals (out of 2 positive), in | patient with
angioedema and CU (out of 18 positive), and in 3 patients with
CU without angioedema (out of 11 positive). No correlations

indicative of circulating vasoactive
factors that could be relevant to the pathogenesis of the disease.
In subsequent years, histamine-releasing autoantibodies
targeting the high-affinity IgE receptor or IgE were identified
in patients with CU [8,9], and ASST was proposed as a
screening test for functional autoantibodies in CU patients [13].
Nowadays, ASST is considered more a test for autoreactivity
than a specific test for histamine-releasing autoantibodies, as
it has been shown to have moderate specificity as a marker
for functional autoantibodies targeting FceRI or IgE, but
a high negative predictive value (92.8%) for patients with
or without CU [17]. According to the expert panel of the
European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology,
a negative ASST result is a useful surrogate marker of the
absence of circulating histamine-releasing autoantibodies [17].
Conversely, BHR has been used as a confirmatory test showing
the presence of functionally active histamine-releasing
autoantibodies [18], since a routine in vitro assay able to detect
circulating and functionally active anti-FceRIo and/or antiIgE autoantibodies is still lacking. Negative ASST results in
patients with idiopathic angioedema without wheals enable us
to rule out the presence of histamine-releasing autoantibodies
in the vast majority of patients. In fact, we were able to detect
weak serum histamine-releasing activity just above the cutoff
value in 2 out of 19 patients with idiopathic angioedema
without wheals, indicating that small amounts of histaminereleasing autoantibodies may occasionally be present in
this group. In one patient, histamine-releasing activity was
detected using basophils bearing membrane IgE, indicating
the presence of anti-IgE autoantibodies, whereas in the other
patient, histamine release was observed only after stripping
basophil-bound IgE, thus suggesting the presence of anti-FceRI
autoantibodies. Consistent with previous observations, patients
with CU either with or without angioedema showed frequent
autoreactivity, since ASST was positive in 76.3% and 50%
of cases, respectively, suggesting the presence of circulating

vasoactive factors and/or histamine-releasing autoantibodies in
at least half of the patients [7,17]. It is interesting to note that
the percentage of positive ASST results was higher in patients
with CU and angioedema than in patients with CU without
angioedema, thus confirming the observation by Nettis et al
[19], who noted that CU patients with angioedema were more
frequently ASST-positive than those without angioedema.
Accordingly, patients with a positive basophil activation test
result showed a higher prevalence of other autoantibodies and
more severe urticaria and were more likely to have angioedema
[20]. However, this has not been a consistent finding in other
studies [21,22]. A significant difference between the 3 patient
groups was also found for BHR: patients with angioedema
and CU had the strongest serum histamine-releasing activity.
Therefore, the overall impression is that autoreactivity is more
common and stronger in patients with angioedema and CU
than in patients with CU without angioedema. It is noteworthy
that the percentage of positive BHR results was lower than
the percentage of positive ASST results in both CU groups,
indicating lower sensitivity for the former than for the latter,
as found in a previous study by our group [15] and confirmed
by Platzer et al [23]. This finding may be explained, at least in
part, by the characteristics of the basophils used in the assay,
such as releasability, density of membrane IgE, and availability
of free FceRI receptors; in fact, percentage positivity increases
if basophils from different donors or human mast cells are
used [24].

In conclusion, negative ASST findings demonstrate
the lack of circulating vasoactive factors and histaminereleasing autoantibodies in most patients with idiopathic
nonhistaminergic angioedema without wheals, in contrast
to patients with CU either with or without angioedema.
Furthermore, the predominance of males among patients with
idiopathic nonhistaminergic angioedema does not support an
autoimmune origin for this disorder, whereas the predominance

A Tedeschi, et al

 

of women among patients with CU is consistent with the
known predilection of autoimmune disorders in females
[25]. The different rates of autoreactivity, as assessed by
ASST and BHR, provide an explanation for the different
efficacy of H; antihistamines. In fact, H; antihistamines are
scarcely effective in most patients with idiopathic angioedema
without wheals, whereas they represent the cornerstone of CU
treatment. Assessment of autoreactivity by ASST, BHR, or
both may help to predict the response to H, antihistamines in
patients presenting with recurrent angioedema.
