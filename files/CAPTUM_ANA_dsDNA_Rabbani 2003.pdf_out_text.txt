anti-D relapsed. Two patients after splenectomy and one
after a second dose of anti-D.

Follow up of patients who were resistant to anti-D

Five out of 11 patients were non responders to an
initial infusion of anti-D. Three underwent splenectomy.
One received a second infusion of IV anti-D and remained
in complete remission till last follow up. One patient was
lost to follow up.

Discussion

Patients with ITP may require therapy to increase the
platelet counts for a variety of reasons and a number of
therapies are available to achieve that effect. However most
of these therapies are helpful on short term basis and many
have unacceptable side effects and high costs. Anti-D
appears to be promising since cost is low and side effects
are minor and rare. It can be given on outpatient basis
saving admission costs and considerable morbidity
associated with other second line therapies.

In our study the responses were rapid, had with
minimal toxicity a reasonable duration of effect.

However in comparison to splenectomy the response
rates were significantly lower and durable responses were
seen in only 50% of the patients as compared to more than
70% in the splenectomy arm.

Most of the available literature recommends anti-D

as splenectomy sparing therapy and our recommendation
would remain such too. The comparison of response rates

and the duration of responses with international studies are
summarized in table 2.

Conclusion

It is concluded that anti-D is a relatively safe,
convenient and effective therapy for chronic ITP and can be
used as a splenectomy sparing agent when treatment is
clinically indicated. A 50 pg /kg dose of anti-D yields more
than 50% response rates with median duration of effect of
12 weeks.

Abstract

Objective: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune process in which cutaneous lesions occur
in majority of patients. This study from Karachi, Pakistan was conducted to determine the pattern and prevalence
of such lesions in SLE in Pakistani patients.

Methods: One hundred ninety eight patients with SLE fulfilling the clinical and laboratory criteria of the American
Rheumatology Association were examined between 1986 and 2001° for the presence of cutaneous
manifestations.

Results: Skin changes noted were: noncicatricial diffuse alopecia (22%), malar rash (31%), mucosal lesions
(20%), discoid eruptions (15%), photosensitivity (33%), vascular lesions (20%), pruritis (17%), and pigmentary
changes (22%). Peripheral gangrene,chronic ulcers, Raynauds phenomenon, urticaria, chilblains,
thrombophlebitis, palmar erythema, and erythema multiform were rare. Anti ANA and anti dsDNA were positive
in 93% and 83% patients respectively.

Conclusion: A different clinical pattern was noted in our patients than reported previously (JPMA 53:539;2003).

Introduction

SLE is perhaps the best example of a multi system
disorder in which cutaneous components of the disease can
yield valuable diagnostic and prognostic information.
Variations however exist in the incidence, clinical
heterogeneity and severity of disease between different
ethnic and racial groups. Environmental, cultural or genetic
backgrounds may explain these variations.!2 The skin and
mucous membranes are symptomatically involved at some
point in over 80% of patients with SLE. There is a
tremendous variability and diversity in the type of
involvement ranging from classical butterfly rash and
atrophic hyperkeratotic lesions of discoid lupus to bullae,
alopecia and vasculitis or dermal vessels.4

For purpose of identifying patients in clinical studies
American Rheumatology Association (ARA) revised
criteria! for classification of lupus is used. A person is said
to have SLE if any 4 or more of the 11 criteria are present,
serially or simultaneously during any interval of
observation. Cutaneous lesions are important as a diagnostic
aid as reflected by the fact that they account for four of the
11 revised ARA criteria of SLE.

Data on the cutaneous features of SLE in Pakistan
seems somewhat scarce. The main purpose of this study was
to analyze the clinical importance and prevalence of
cutaneous lesions in SLE in Pakistani patients.

Patients and Methods

Record files of all patients between 1986 and 2001
who fulfilled the American Rheumatology Association
revised criteria for the classification of SLE! were reviewed
retrospectively.

Using SPSS soft version (Release 8.0, standard
version, copyright c SPSS; 1989-97), the patients were
analyzed according to their age, sex, and clinical features
with special attention to cutaneous manifestations.
Laboratory investigations included complete blood counts,
serum creatinine, ESR, Serum total proteins, 24 hours
urinary proteins and creatinine clearance, anti nuclear
factor, anti-DNA, Rheumatoid factor, serum compliment
levels, anti-ENA, skin biopsy, chest X-ray, ultrasound
kidneys and echocardiogram.

Results

Of the total 196 patients who fulfilled the American
Rheumatology Association revised criteria for SLE, 88%
were females and 12 % were male patients with male to
female ratio of 1:8. Mean age at presentation was 31 years
(412.3). Precipitating factors included sunlight (50%),
pregnancy (10%), drugs (15%) and infections (7.5%). At the
time of presentation only 10% patients had only cutaneous

lesions, 60% had cutaneous and systemic lesions and 30%
had only systemic lesions.

Among LE-specific lesions noted were malar rash
(31%), discoid rash (15%), photosensitivity (33%) and
mucopapular rash (20%). Bullae were not seen. Nonspecific lesions of SLE included vascular telangiectasia
(17%), micro infarcts (14%), palmar erythema (20%),
chronic ulcers (3%), peripheral gangrene (2%), chilblains
(1%), thrombophelibitis (2%), Raynaud's phenomenon
(2.5%), livedo reticularis (3%) and erythema multiform
(1%). None of the patients had atrophae blanche,
rheumatoid nodules, erythromelalgia, sclerodactaly or
pyoderma gangreosum. Hyperpigmentation occurred in
20% of patients. Hair Changes included noncicatricial
diffuse alopecia, cicatricial alopecia and lupus hair.

Seven percent patients presented with nail changes,
and included ragged cuticles (3%), leukonychia (3%),
splinter hemorrhages (2%), paronychia (10%), nail fold
telangiectasia (5%) and onycholysis (7%). Bluish
discoloration of nails was not observed in our series of
patients.

Oral mucosal lesions occurred in 21% of the
patients. Superficial erosions, discoid lesions and erythema
were noted on the lips, palate, buccal mucosa and gums. The
rest of the mucosal surfaces of the body were not affected.
Other findings were localized and generalized pruritis (7%),
Urticaria (10%), Acquired ichthyosis (1%) and acanthosis
nigricans (1%). Calcinosis, facial edema and panniculitis
(5) were not recorded.

540
Infections noted were, herpes labialis (3%), herpes
zoster (2%), scabies (2%), furunculosis and folliculitis
(4%), tinea corporis (7%), cellulitis and abscess (5%) and
oral candidiasis (12%).

Systemic involvement was present in 90% patients
and included arthritis (38%), nephritis (36%), pericarditis
(12%), lung involvement (17%) and CNS involvement
(30%). 83% Patients were found to have hematological
disturbances with anemia (71%), leukopenia (20%),
lymphopenia (53%) and thrombocytopenia (26%). ESR was
raised in nearly 100% patients. Other positive laboratory
findings included positive ANA (93%), anti dsDNA (83%),
low C3 (85%), low C4 (41%), protienuria (24%), and RBC
and casts in the urine (32%).

Discussion

Cutaneous lesions occurred in 70% patients in our
study, an incidence that closely matched that of studies by
Font et al? and Hochberg.> Cutaneous manifestations were
initial presentation in 10% of our patients as against 25%
mentioned by Watson® and Kapadia.” The preponderance of
women closely matched that of other populations (e.g., 28
out of 32 in an Indian’ and 73 out of 78 in an Australian?
study). Age at onset was lower (i.e., 30 years on average)
than that reported earlier.?:!° Contrary to the results given by
Yell and Burge!!, pregnancy exacerbated the disease in all
of our patients.

Among the LE-specific lesions, the percentage of
discoid rash was considerably lower than that recorded by
Kapadia.’ Photosensitivity was however, more common.
Digital gangrene was rarely seen in our study because of
low incidence of Raynaud's phenomenon. Chronic ulcers,
thrombophlebitis, erythema multiform, urticaria, acanthosis
nigricans, and acquired ichthyosis proved to be rare as
cited.®

Hyperpigmentation was noted in 20% of our
patients; where as Tuffanelli!! noted it in 8.4% of his cases.
This difference could be due to excessive exposure to
sunlight in our part of the world and a general tendency to
post-inflammatory melanosis.”

Diffuse nonscaring alopecia was a more frequent and
early manifestation of the disease (seen in 22% of our
patients), as compared to 37% quoted by Akhtar and

Khan!°, 57% by Wysenbeek!? and 58% by AlarconSegovia.'4 Rothfield, however, noted this sign in 70% of his
patients. 14

Bluish discoloration of nails as noticed commonly
by Kapadia et al.? was not seen in our patients. Among
mucosal lesions lower lip involvement was a frequent
finding in our patients.

The incidence of ANA-negative SLE was similar
(7%) as compared to 4-13% reported previously. !5 Anti
dsDNA antibodies were elevated in 83% of our patients
which matched previously recorded data.

Conclusion

Cutaneous lesions in SLE are important as a
diagnostic aid as reflected by the fact that they account for
four of the 11 revised American Rheumatism Association
criteria of SLE. The pattern and incidence of skin changes
may vary from place to place.
