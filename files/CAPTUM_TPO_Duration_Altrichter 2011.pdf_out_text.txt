Abstract

Background: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (csU), which is characterized by recurrent episodes of mast cell-driven wheal
and flare-type skin reactions, is often associated with elevated total IgE levels and thyroid autoimmunity. We speculate that
some csU patients express IgE autoantibodies against thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase (TPO), which could bind
to skin mast cells and induce their activation.

Methods: We developed and used a site-directed human IgE capture ELISA to quantify IgE-anti-TPO. We used this assay and
investigated csU patients (n=478) and healthy control subjects (n= 127) for IgE-anti-TPO and then assessed IgE-anti-TPOpositive and -negative csU patients for clinical and serological differences.

Principal Findings: CsU patients were found to express more than 2fold higher IgE-anti-TPO serum levels as compared to
healthy control subjects (p<0.001). 54% of csU patients had serum levels higher than the cut off (=5 IU/ml). By distribution
analyses we identified two distinct subpopulations of csU patients: 1) IgE-anti-TPO'” (= 39%, IgE-anti-TPO: median 2.17
interquartile range 0.86-5.44, = comparable to healthy controls) and 2) IgE-anti-TPOn'sh (=61%, IgE-anti-TPO: median 6.67,
interquartile range 5.39-8.24). IgE-anti-TPO-positive and -negative csU patients had very similar distributions of age and
gender as well as disease activity and duration. IgE-anti-TPO-positive csU patients exhibited significantly higher IgG-anti
TPO levels and lymphocyte counts as well as decreased C4 complement levels.

Conclusion: Our findings show that a sizeable subgroup of csU patients expresses IgE antibodies against thyroid
peroxidase. These autoantibodies could cause “autoallergic” mast cell activation, a novel pathomechanism of chronic
spontaneous urticaria.

Results

Chronic spontaneous urticaria patients exhibit elevated
levels of IgE against thyroid peroxidase (IgE-anti-TPO)

Levels of IgE-anti-TPO, as ed by site-directed IgE capture
ELISA, were found to be significantly higher in csU patients
(median 5.50, interquartile range IQR 3.2-7.7) as compared to
healthy subjects (median 1.46, IQR 0.27-4.45 IU/ml) (Fig. la).
Based on the ROC analysis of these findings (Fig. 1b) we defined
5.0 IU/ml as the cut off value (specificity =0.8, Table 1) and
found that 259 of 478 csU patients (54.2%) exhibit elevated
of IgE-anti-TPO.

similar to the healthy controls and the other one above the indicated cut off level of 5 |U/ml. Figure 2b Theoretical ROC-Curve: The theoretical ROCCurve shows the result of the applied method of mixed distribution to identify subgroups within the patients’ sample. This analysis was motivated by
the hypothesis that only for a subtype of the disease IgE is involved in the pathological pathway. For the resulting normal distribution of the second

IgE [8] or its high affinity receptor FcepsitonRI [9]. Th IgG
autoantibodies can be detected in 24% to 60% of csU patients
[10-12] and they have been shown to be relevant in patients with
autoreactive csU, ie. csU patie that are positive in the
autologous (ASST) [12,13]. In contrast, IgE
autoantibodi in about 50% of csU
patients in our study, have not be ant for the
activation of mast cells in csU, except for in single patients. Ten
years ago, Bar Sela and cowor! were able to detect such
antibodies in the serum of a female patient who suffered from csU
and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis [14]. Subsequent studies using classic
ELISA or RAST were unable to reproduce these findings in
patients with csU and thyroid autoimmunity [15], probably due to
interfering IgG autoantibodies [16] and the limited sensitivity of
these assays. We were able to detect IgE specific for TPO by
classical ELISA (Supplemental Figure S1b). Only after depleting
competing IgG autoantibodies from the patient serum via protein
G affinity chromatography and after oving all minor proteins
by centrifugal ultrafiltration (Supplemental Figure Slc). In
contrast, the new human-IgE-capturing-enzyme immunoassay
developed and used in the present study allows for the detection of
IgE-autoantibodie ic to TPO without prior depletion of IgG
antibodies. (Supplemental Figure S1a)

Autoallergic mast cell activation has been implied to play a role in
other chronic inflammatory skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis
[17,18] and bullous pemphigoid [19,20,21]. In both es IgE

antibodies directed to skin antigens have been described and may

 

   

 

 

 

play a role in the pathogenesis by activating cutaneous mast cells
after binding their corresponding skin antigen. In contrast, the IgE
autoantibodies detected in our study are directed against an
extracutaneous antigen (= autoallergen), i.e. TPO, which can be
released from the thyroid into the circulation. IgE-anti-TPO is,
therefore, likely to be bound to mast cells, basophils and other
F CepsitonRI-expressing cells throughout the body. This may explain,
why symptoms in csU patients are not limited to the skin, as in
atopic dermatitis and bullous pemphigoid, but can also involve the
gut, the airways, the joints and other organs.

 

 

 

For atopic dermatitis it was postulated that mimicry of protein
domains of external allergens and self-proteins may turn an allergy
inst an environmental allergens into an autoallergy [22,23,24].
s unlikely to be the case in csU, which is rarely assoc
allergies to environmental allergens. However, autoallergen mimicry
cannot be excluded in csU, as the extracellular domain of TPO has a
similarity of around 45% with myeloperoxidases sinophils
[25]. Also, IgE-anti-TPO production and detection may involve
peroxidases of common cutaneous pathogens, including fungi.

CsU patients have been repeatedly reported to show a high
incidence of autoimmune thyroiditis [6,26], and up to 33% of
patients reportedly express increased IgG antibodies directed against
thyroid peroxidase or thyreoglobuline as compared to 5% in healthy
individuals [7]. Also, csU patients exhibit significantly (more than
4fold) increased levels of total serum IgE (>100 U/ml) [3]. In
contrast, relevant sensitizations against common environmental
allergens are rarely found in csU patients. These findings may be
explained, at least in part, by the results of our study: 1) IgE-anti- TPO
expression is positively correlated to IgG-anti-TPO expr

express potentially urticaria-inducing IgE-anti-TPO. 2) IgE-antiTPO may contribute to higher total IgE levels in csU patients.

 

 

   

ion. In

With autoreactivity, intolerance, infection, and other underlying
conditions shown to be relevant causes of csU, it is unlikely that IgEanti-T'PO is the relevant mast cell activator in all csU patients. Our
statistical analyses using the method of mixed distribution identified
2 distinct subgroups — one IgE-anti-T’ 0 and the other IgE-antiTPO". This supports the theory that autoallergy is of pathological
relevance only in a subpopulation of csU patients. However, IgE
autoantibodies directed against other autoantigens may exist and
act as relevant mast cell activators in those patients shown to express
low levels of or no IgE-anti-TPO [27].

Interestingly, IgG-anti-TPO and IgE-anti-TPO are positively
correlated in IgE-anti-TPO+ but not IgE-anti-TPO- csU patients,
suggesting that IgG-anti-TPO may be a good screening marker for
the presence of IgE-anti-TPO and vice versa. Also, high IgE-antiTPO is correlated with increased lymphocyte counts and C4

 

   

 

  

consumption, two common features of autoimmune conditions.
There is growing consus that in a subgroup of patients csU should
be regarded as an autoimmune disease with potential upregulation
of previously unrecognized autoimmune manifestations. It ne
be proven that these manifestations are directly related and rel
to the pathogenesis of disease in the affected patient population.

Taken together, we can show that IgE-anti-TPO autoantibodies
are common in csU patients. These findings point towards an
autoallergic mechanism of mast cell activation as a novel and
relevant pathogenetic mechanism in csU. Our results also
encourage to screen csU patients for IgE directed against
autoantigens other than TPO and to test IgE-neutralizing
uch as omlizumab for their efficacy in csU.

by blocking with 2% BSA in PBS. After washings diluted serum

(Sigma-Aldrich, Deisenhofen, Germany, 1:1000 in PBS) and

detection of IgE towards external antigens failed in detecting autoIgE-anti-TPO probably due to competing auto-IgG-anti-TPO.
When possible competing auto-IgG was removed via Protein-G
affinity chromatography and via ultrafiltration through a MW
10000 membrane, this IgE fraction (direct ELISA, black bar)
yielded in a much better detectable signal in OD405 in classic
sandwich ELISA compared to non purified samples (direct ELISA,
white bar). In contrast, the site-directed IgE capture ELISA (Fig.
Sla), allows a highly sensitive detection of occurring auto-IgE-antihuTPO with the sar as for purified IgE samples (sitedirected IgE capture ELISA, white bar). [*] Concha LB, Chang

Figure $2 Standardcurve and Reproducibility of the sitedirected IgE capture ELISA. The site-directed IgE capture ELISA
allows a highly sensitive, straight forward and_ reproducible
detection of auto-IgE-anti-huTPO in the sera of patients. The
site-directed IgE capture ELISA showes an almost linear
correlation of the standard IgE-anti-TPO with the extinction at
405 nm (S2a). The reproducibility of 10 consecutive measurements of one CU patient with a high IgE-anti-TPO level resulted
in a coefficient of variation of 0,127. (S2b)

Figure $3 Immunoblot of purified IgE Fractions of a CUPatient (A) and a healthy control (B) on microsomal thyroid
extrakts run on SDS-PAGE + WB. Proteinstaining of microsomal
thyroid extracts (C) and of purified corunning recombinant hTPO
(D). Proteins of microsomal thyroid extracts (40 ug TPO/ml) and
purified corunning recombinant hTPO were separated on
discontinuous SDS polyacrylamide gels (conc. 3%/8% acc.).
Electrophoresis was run in a Hoefer SE-260 Mighty VE-chamber
(Pharmacia GmbH, Freiburg) at 8°C, 40 mA, for 150 minutes.
Western blotting of separated proteins on 0,45 Lm nitrocellulose
sheets (Schleicher & Schiill, Dassel, Germany) was performed in a
Hoefer Mini-Transfer chamber (Pharmacia GmbH, Freiburg,
Germany). Afterwards the sheets were cut in strips. One strip witl
microsomal thyroid extracts (C) and one with recombinant TPO
(D) underwent an immediate staining with 0,01% Amidoblack in
10% Acetic acid, 20% MeOH, 70% water. The remaining strip
with microsomal thyroid extracts were blocked with 5% mill
powder in 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris/HCl pH 8,0, 0,05%
Tween 20 (TBST) overnight at 4°C and afterwards incubated for
2 hours in separate bags with purified anti-TPO IgE (diluted 1:10
in TBST, 1%BSA) of sera taken from a CU patient (A) and heald
control (B). Specific human IgE antibodies were marked by goat
anti-human IgE alkaline phosphatase conjugates (1:400 in TBST,
1% BSA) for 2h at 25°C. Dye reaction was started with 50 ml
0,02% Nitro blue tetrazolium in 150 mM Tris/HCl pH 9,6,
100 pl 2M MgCl2 and 20 ul 0,2% 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphoshate (BCIP). After 60 min. incubation time at 25°C the
reaction was stopped with water.
