Background: Basophils are implicated in the pathogenesis of
chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU). Autoantibodies to the IgE
receptor (FceRI) and serum histamine releasing activity have
been detected in some subjects with CIU, although their role

in vivo is unclear. Basophils of patients with CIU have altered
FceRI-mediated histamine release (HR); however, the mechanism
is unknown. In the basophil FceRI signaling pathway, protein
levels of Sre-homology 2-containing—S' -inositol phosphatase
(SHIP)-1 are inversely correlated with the release of mediators or
releasability. A related phosphatase, SHIP-2, is a negative
regulator of monocyte IgG receptor (FeyR) signaling . We
hypothesized that SHIP levels are altered in CIU basophils.
Methods: Blood basophils were isolated from cold urticaria,
CIU, or normal donors, and FceRI-dependent and independent
HR were quantified. Protein levels of SHIP-1, SHIP-2, spleen
tyrosine kinase, and phosphorylated Akt were determined by
Western blotting. Subjects’ serum was tested for serum
histamine releasing activity and anti-FceRIa antibodies.
Results: CIU basophils displayed a bimodal response to
anti-IgE activation. One half of CIU subjects’ basophils had
reductions in anti-IgE—induced HR and were designated
nonresponders (CIU NR). CIU NR basophil HR remained
diminished at 10-fold to 30-fold higher doses of anti-IgE. CIU
anti-IgE responder basophils had HR similar to normal
subjects. SHIP-1 and SHIP-2 proteins were increased in CIU
NR basophils and were linked to reduced phosphoAkt after
anti-IgE stimulation. CIU basophil anti-IgE response was not
related to the presence of serologic factors.

Conclusion: In CIU basophils, the observed changes in FceRIT
signaling pathway molecule expression may underlie changes
in releasability.

Urticaria is a common disorder affecting as much as
25% of the US population.! Acute urticarial eruptions can
be triggered by allergic reactions to medications, food, and
insect stings or in the setting of viral infections. In chronic
urticaria, defined as recurrent episodes of urticaria for longer than 6 weeks, a minority of cases (~20%) are triggered
by physical stimuli such as exposure to cold, heat, pressure, vibration, or specific wavelengths of light.'! However, the majority of chronic urticaria cases lack an
identifiable trigger and are labeled chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU).

In the last decade, several groups have described circulating autoantibodies to IgE or the « subunit of the highaffinity IgE receptor (FceRIa) in subjects with CIU. Other
studies have shown the ability of certain CIU subjects’ sera
to induce histamine releasing activity (HRA) from normal
basophils.’ Although the presence of either serum factor
(HRA or autoantibodies) has been used to classify subjects
with CIU as autoimmune, a poor correlation has been shown
between the presence of serum HRA and FceRIa antibodies
in the same individual.* The dual presence of anti-FceRIa
autoantibodies and serum HRA has been linked to CIU
disease severity.* However, the expression of anti-FceRIa
antibodies in other skin diseases” and healthy subjects® has
left their role in CIU pathogenesis unclear. Furthermore,
because only 40% of subjects with CIU have a detectable
serologic factor, the mechanism underlying the majority of
CIU disease cases is unknown.

Basopenia in CIU has been described for decades,’ and
recently, basopenia has been correlated with disease activity and the presence of serum HRA.*” A possible explanation for basopenia is the recruitment of blood basophils to
skin tissues. Skin biopsies of both lesional and nonlesional
skin from subjects with CIU show basophils, and at similar frequency in subjects with or without HRA.'°!*
Functionally, basophils from subjects with CIU have reduced anti-IgE—induced histamine release (HR) compared
with nonatopic subjects, but not in response to other

degranulation stimuli such as calcium-ionophore.'* Other
work suggests that subjects with CIU with serum HRA
have the greatest reduction in basophil anti-IgE induced
HR.” Of note, CIU basophils have increased anti-IgE
induced histamine release in parallel with reduced urticarial symptoms, suggesting that the defect in basophil HR
via the FceRI pathway appears to correlate with the active
phase of the disease.

Although altered histamine secretion by basophils is
observed in CIU, an analysis of the changes in signaling
molecules in the FceRI pathway that accompany cellular
activation or releasability has not been reported. A novel
Src-homology 2-containing—5’-inositol phosphatase
(SHIP)-1 has been gaining prominence as a gatekeeper
of the IgE mediated response and as a negative regulator
of hemopoietic cell activation, survival, and proliferation.'*'5 SHIP-1 is a hematopoietic signaling molecule
with multiple forms (145, 135, 125, 110 kd) that hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5 trisphosphate (PIP3),
thereby limiting a crucial step between the release of calcium from intracellular stores and the influx of extracellular calcium. Mast cells of SHIP-1 knockout mice
more readily degranulate after IgE receptor activation or
even IgE sensitization alone. Similarly, in hyperreleasable
human basophils, a reduction in SHIP-1 protein levels is associated with heightened response to human recombinant
histamine releasing factor (HrHRF).'°'’ The phosphatase
activity of SHIP-1 does not change after cytokine stimulation.'* Furthermore, anti-IgE stimulation does not change
basophil SHIP-1 protein expression.'? However, TGF-B
has been shown to regulate SHIP-1 expression and is involved in apoptosis in human lymphocytes and endotoxin
tolerance in bone marrow-derived mast cells and macrophages.?°?! A related molecule, SHIP-2, also hydrolyzes
PIP; and in human monocytes is a negative regulator of
IgG receptor (FeyR) signaling.?*>

In this study, we have investigated the protein expression of SHIP-1 and SHIP-2 and histamine release in the
basophils of subjects with chronic urticaria. We report for
the first time that 2 distinct basophil anti-IgE mediated
functional profiles exist in subjects with active CIU,
responders and nonresponders. We further report that
levels of these negative regulators are altered in the

and/or FceRIa autoantibodies.

METHODS
Study subjects

Adult volunteers (with and without allergy) and those with either
CIU or cold urticaria were recruited from the Johns Hopkins Asthma
and Allergy Center. Subjects underwent venipuncture after informed
consent via a protocol approved by the Western Institutional Review
Board or Johns Hopkins Hospital Institutional Review Board.
Subjects with allergy were characterized by positive skin tests and
a history of allergic rhinitis or asthma, whereas subjects without
allergy lacked these features. Characteristics of study subjects are
shown in Table I. Additional details of subjects with CIU and their
active medications are in listed in this article’s Table El in the
Online Repository at www.jacionline.org. Subjects were excluded
if they had received a course of systemic steroids in the month before
venipuncture. All subjects with chronic urticaria reported active
disease at the time of the blood sample collection, or in the case of
cold urticaria, had a positive ice cube test.

Basophil isolation

Venous blood samples for basophil studies were drawn into
syringes containing 5 mmol/L EDTA, and a separate tube was collected for serum assays. For HR assays, the blood was subjected to
dextran sedimentation to obtain mixed leukocytes with an average
basophil purity <1%.7* For Westem blotting studies, enriched basophils were obtained by density-gradient sedimentation with Percoll
using Accuspin separation tubes (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Mo),?°
and then further purified by negative selection with a basophil separation kit (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, British Columbia,
Canada; purity >95%) as described.'’ Basophils were counted using
Alcian blue staining.”°

Basophil histamine release

Assays were performed in standard buffers containing calcium at
37°C for 45 minutes. Mixed blood leukocytes isolated by dextran
sedimentation were stimulated for histamine release by polyclonal
goat antihuman IgE (0.01-3 g/mL), N-formyl-met-leu-phe (FMLP;
1 pmol/L), ionomycin (5 mol/L), or HrHRF (17.6 mol/L; gift of
Dr Susan MacDonald, Johns Hopkins)'® for 45 minutes at 37°C.
Histamine was quantified in cell-free supernatants using an automated fluorometric assay.?’ Results are shown as the percentage
of total histamine content present in total cell lysates of leukocyte aliquots after subtracting spontaneous release. To calculate the percent
maximal histamine release from a donor’s basophil anti-IgE mediated
histamine release curve, the dose at which maximal release occurred
is assigned a value of 100% and all other histamine release values are
referenced to this maximal point.

Western blotting for SHIP-1, SHIP-2,
Syk, and phosphorylated Akt (phosphoAkt)

Basophil whole cell lysates (>95% purity, generally 5 X 10° cell
equivalents) whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE gel
electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose for the immunoblotting of the indicated proteins. All gels included 2 doses of a standard
lysate of human T cells to allow comparisons of band intensity across
gels within a previously determined linear range of antibody staining.'” Immunoblotting was performed sequentially with the following antibodies: SHIP-1 (N1, rabbit), SHIP-2 (120, goat), and spleen
tyrosine kinase (Syk) (4D10, mouse) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, Calif). Membranes were stripped between each immunoblot with a stripping buffer (69 mmol/L SDS, 62 mmol/L Trizma
base, pH 6.7, 0.7% B-mercaptoethanol). For phosphoAkt studies, purified basophils were stimulated up to 30 minutes with anti-IgE (0.10.3 g/mL) before lysis for Western blotting. Immunoblotting was
performed sequentially with an antiphosphoAkt-Ser473 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Mass) followed by extracellular signalrelated kinase (ERK) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to normalize
phophoAkt as described.”* The detection of specific proteins was performed with the appropriate secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP; GE Healthcare Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and
chemiluminescence (Supersignal, Pierce) film radiography. Digital images of detected protein bands were quantified using Kodak digital software (Kodak, New Haven, Conn). We have previously demonstrated
the ability to detect statistically significant 2-fold changes in protein
expression with this approach?”

Serum HRA

In preliminary studies, a panel of basophil donors (with and
without allergy; n = 9) were screened for robust release to anti-IgE
and CIU sera.*! A single allergic donor was selected whose basophils
were then activated by dilutions of the CIU or normal subjects’ sera
(50%, 25%, 5%) as well as anti-IgE (0.1 g/mL; mean 43%; n = 7)
and FMLP (mean 28%; n = 7) as positive controls. Histamine content
was quantified in cell-free supernatants as noted.

Serum immunoreactivity for FceRla

Diluted subjects’ sera (1:250) were used to immunoblot a standard
lysate of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-SX38 cells transfected with
human FceRIa as described.”** RBL-SX38 cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Membranes were next
immunoblotted with each individual serum, followed by use of a secondary antihuman IgG-HRP (Amersham-Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ)
to detect the presence of the anti-FceRIa IgG protein. As a positive control, a single lane of each gel was immunoblotted with a commercial
antibody against FceRIa (polyclonal rabbit antihuman FceRIa subunit;
Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), followed by antirabbit HRP
(Amersham-Pharmacia) to allow comparisons of relative band intensity
between gels.”°** Analysis of band density was conducted using the
Quantity One (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif) imaging system. Using this
software, a 3-dimensional model of each band was generated. The
volume of each band was calculated and adjusted for local background. Positive serum immunoreactivity was based on 2 criteria:
an adjusted volume greater than | unit and an adjusted volume greater
than 10% of the respective gel positive control.**

Statistical design

The statistical analysis used the STAT VIEW 5 package for Macintosh (SAS, Cary, NC). The Student ¢ test was used for normally distributed data such as basophil HR response, whereas nonparametric analysis
was used for protein expression (ie, SHIP-1 and SHIP-2). A p value less
than .05 was considered significant. All error bars represent SEMs.

RESULTS
Basophil functional response

Basophil functional responses to both FeeRI-dependent
(anti-IgE) and independent (FMLP, ionomycin and
recombinant [r]HrHRF) stimuli were examined. Surprisingly, CIU basophils appeared to have a bimodal distribution of basophil HR response to an optimal dose of
polyclonal anti-IgE (0.1 g/mL) compared with normal
donors (Fig 1, A). Twenty of 40 subjects with CIU examined had significant reductions in their basophil anti-[gE—
induced HR (<10% HR) and were designated anti-IgE
nonresponders (CIU NR), whereas the remaining CIU
subjects had an intact basophil anti-IgE induced response
and were designated anti-IgE responders (CIU R). CIU
NR subjects had significant reductions in their average
basophil IgE dependent release (mean = 3%) compared
with normal subjects (mean = 37%; P < .00001), CIU
R (mean = 42%; P < .00001), and subjects with a physical
urticaria (cold-induced; mean = 37%; P < .00001). CIU
NR and CIU R basophils also significantly differed in their
FMLP response (mean = 18% vs 39%; P < .002; Fig 1,
B). Although an overall reduction in anti-lgE mediated
response by basophils of subjects with CIU has been reported,”"'* the presence of a CIU subgroup with normal
basophil anti-IgE response is novel. Further, all chronic
urticaria subtypes failed to show significant release
(>10% of total histamine content) to HrHRF, indicating
they are not hyperreleasable basophils.'’ Of note, no clear
pattern of clinical treatments (see this article’s Table E1 in
the Online Repository at www.jacionline.org) was related
to CIU functional subtype, and functional phenotype was
confirmed in a subset of subjects off all treatments (n = 8,
3 CIU NR and 5 CIU R). To investigate the stability of basophil functional categorization of subjects with CIU, we
repeatedly sampled 16 active CIU subjects’ basophils (10
CIU NR and 6 CIU R). We found persistence of the original basophil functional category for as long as 38 months
among CIU NR subjects (range, 1-38 months) and for as
long as 58 months in CIU R subjects (range, 4-52 months)
from the time of initial sample.

On the basis of the results of stimulation of CIU
basophils with an optimal dose of anti-IgE, we expanded
our studies to include a full range of anti-IgE doses (0.01-3
pg/mL). CIU NR basophil HR averaged <12% at all antiIgE doses tested (Fig 1, C). We found that a ~10-fold
higher dose of anti-IgE is necessary for CIU NR basophils
to achieve maximal HR (see Methods and Fig 1, D). In
a small subset of CIU NR donors, calcium-ionophore—
induced HR is normal (>60%; n = 3), supporting the
idea that the HR defect is specific to the FceRI pathway.
Likewise, an earlier study has demonstrated that calciumionophore-induced HR is not altered in CIU basophils.'>

(*P < 0.05) and CIU R (#P < .03). Error bars represent SEMs.

5% to 10% of the population. In this condition, a protein
deficiency of the tyrosine kinase Syk, a critical early
signaling molecule in receptor signaling, has been correlated with histamine release of <10% after optimal antiIgE stimulation.**°° We examined the levels of this
tyrosine kinase in the purified basophil lysates of CIU
and normal subjects by Western blotting (Fig 2, A). No
significant differences in average Syk protein levels were
noted among chronic urticaria subtypes and in particular
by basophils of CIU NR (Fig 2, B). A deficiency of Syk
was noted in each category (1 CIU R, 3 CIU NR, 1 cold
urticaria, and 1 normal).*° Thus, the nonreleaser condition
did not explain the functional shift present in basophils of
CIU NR.

We next explored the expression of a known, SHIP-1,
and a putative, SHIP-2, negative regulator of basophil IgE
receptor activation. Both SHIP-1 (145 kd) and SHIP-2
(155 kd) proteins were found in the basophils of both
subjects with CIU and normal subjects (Fig 2, A). Using
the standard T-cell lysate for normalization, basophils of
CIU NR (363 + 139 relative units; n = 6) have increased
expression of the phosphatase SHIP-2, relative to normal
subjects (166 + 53; n = 7; P < .05) and CIU R (70 = 14;
n = 6; P < .03; Fig 2, C). In contrast, CIU R subjects and
subjects with cold urticaria have decreased SHIP-1 levels
(32 + 8;n = 6; P < .05; and 43 + 17;n =5; P< .05, respectively) compared with normal subjects (74 + 18;n =
7). Further, CIU R SHIP-1 levels were also significantly

FIG 3. Expression of phosphoAkt in basophils from CIU NR, CIU R, and a normal donor. A, Basophil lysates
were examined at the indicated time points after stimulation with anti-IgE (0.1-0.3 g/mL) for the expression

reduced relative to CIU NR (115 + 49; n = 6; P < .05).
However, the levels of SHIP-1 in CIU R subjects and subjects with cold urticaria are not reduced to the levels (<20
relative units) found in hyperreleasable basophils known
to degranulate to HrHRF.'’ These measures of SHIP protein levels are consistent with the observed functional
behavior of the basophils (Fig 1) and also agree with other
published reports of SHIP-1 serving as a gatekeeper of
IgE-mediated mediator responses. '**'” This is also the first
report of SHIP-2 expression in blood basophils.

We next examined the functional effect of elevated
SHIP-1 and SHIP-2 protein levels in CIU NR and reduced
SHIP-1 protein levels in CIU R basophils on the FceRImediated phosphorylation of Akt. This phosphorylation is
an indirect indicator of the amount of PIP; generated on
anti-IgE stimulation and can occur as 1 of 3 isoforms.”*
PIP; is produced by phosphatidyl inositol-3 (PI3) kinase
and hydrolyzed by inositol phosphatases including
SHIP-1 and SHIP-2. We found that phosphoAkt generation (60 kd) is blunted in basophils of CIU NR subjects,
even at higher doses of anti-IgE stimulation, compared
with the normal basophils and as previously reported>”
(Fig 3). In contrast with CIU NR and normal basophils,
CIU R basophils demonstrate evidence of phosphoAkt activation (60 kd) at baseline with a modest induction after
FceRI-mediated activation. In addition, all 3 CIU R donors produced a second, more rapidly migrating protein
(58 kd) on blotting unstimulated lysates for phosphoAkt
that did not change with stimulation.

Serum HRA

Although an earlier study linked the presence of serum
HRA to reduced CIU basophil anti-IgE response, there

was also evidence that reductions in basophil function
were present in subjects without serum HRA.” We defined
serum HRA as >20% HR above the spontaneous release
from our normal donor’s basophil induced by any dilution
of sera. We did not find a consistent relationship between
the presence of serum HRA with our CIU basophil antiIgE functional phenotypes (Table II). Serum HRA was
noted in a number of control subjects without allergy but

We have previously described 2 forms of FceRIq, a heterogenous, broad band (~60 kd) and a homogenous band
at 50 kd mass, detected by Western blotting.”° For the current study, we used a dilution of sera (1:250) previously
established to distinguish normal sera from CIU sera*
and strict criteria for quantifying serum immunoreactivity
for either FceRIa isoform.** We found the presence of serum immunoreactivity in less than half of the CIU NR subjects tested. We also detected such activity in the serum of
subjects with cold urticaria and allergy (Table II). We also
failed to see concordance between the 2 assays for serum
factors, as reported by others.*

DISCUSSION

On the basis of the literature, we expected that the
basophils of all subjects with CIU would be reduced in
their degranulation response to stimulation via the IgE
receptor.”"!> However, a careful examination of the distribution of CIU basophil HR in these earlier studies reveals
evidence for a bimodal distribution. We report for the first

time that subjects with CIU can be divided into 2 subsets
on the basis of the profile of basophil functional response
to anti-IgE stimulation and the protein levels of negative
regulatory phosphatases, SHIP-1 and SHIP-2. In addition,
we demonstrate that elevated SHIP-1 and SHIP-2 protein
levels in CIU NR basophils appear functional as measured
by a reduction in FeeRI-mediated phosphoAkt generation,
an indirect measure of PIP3 generation, a substrate for
SHIP-1 and SHIP-2. In the case of CIU R basophils
with reduced SHIP-1 protein levels, phosphoAkt is
present in resting basophils, indicating constitutive PIP;
production. We also provide evidence that a subject’s
basophil functional phenotype is stable over time with
continued CIU disease activity.

Further, we expected that the basophils of CIU anti-IgE
NR would be most likely to possess a serum factor
(autoantibodies to the FeeRIa or HRA) that has activated
the basophils in vivo and left them unresponsive to further
immunologic stimulation via the IgE receptor. We were
surprised that circulating antibodies to FeeRIa and serum
HRA were not exclusively present in the CIU NR, but also
found in CIU and in other control groups. Curiously, we
did not observe serum HRA in the serum of subjects
with allergy, which is consistent with earlier reports describing a low frequency of HRA in non-CIU populations
recruited from allergy clinics. We have also recently reported that basophil surface activation marker expression
is not increased in subjects with CIU with the presence of a
serologic factors.**

From a disease perspective, it is possible that the pattern
of basophil functional response to IgE receptor activation
may offer a biomarker for CIU disease activity. Earlier
work suggested that the reduction in basophil anti-IgE HR
normalizes with reductions in urticarial disease activity.'>
Studies to examine the relationship of disease activity to
these functional categories are underway.** The altered
protein expression of SHIP-1 and SHIP-2 phosphatases
in basophils may also provide insights into pathways
that are involved in CIU. Evidence suggests that the activities of SHIP-1 and SHIP-2 appear to be regulated in part
by altering their protein expression as we observed in CIU
NR and CIU R basophils.*° Further studies are needed to
define these signaling pathways and guide the development of new therapeutic targets for the treatment of CIU.

There has been tremendous interest to view a subset of
CIU as an autoimmune disease given the absence of an
identifiable external trigger or allergen in the majority of

cases. Several groups have described the presence of
circulating autoantibodies to IgE or the FceRIa in CIU
serum or the capacity of selected serum to cause basophil
histamine release from normal basophils in vitro.?“° The
overall incidence of such factors ranges from 10% to
40% of subjects with CIU.*! Methods for detection of
autoimmune serum range from skin injection with autologous serum to gauge for wheal formation to in vitro assays
measuring serum HRA using donor blood basophils. Of
concern is that different assays such as Western blotting
using purified FeeRIa protein have shown poor agreement
with functional assays for HRA using donor basophils.*
Increasing evidence suggests that that anti-FceRIa antibodies occur at similar frequencies in the sera of other immune-mediated skin diseases such as pemphigus vulgaris
(39%), dermatomyositis (36%), bullous pemphigoid (13%),
and systemic lupus erythematosus (20%) as that detected in
the sera of subjects with CIU (38%), but may differ in IgG
isotype.>” Recent studies support that serum HRA is found
in the IgG fraction, can be neutralized by immunoadsorption with FceRIa protein, and involves complement activation via the C5a receptor.*“* Using established protocols to
detect serologic factors, we did not find that the presence of
circulating autoantibodies to FeeRla or serum HRA were
strongly linked to a specific basophil functional phenotype.

In summary, we have confirmed the alteration in
basophil FceRI-mediated histamine response noted by
others in CIU populations. However, we have described a
novel characterization of subjects with CIU on the basis of
the profile of basophil FceRI-mediated degranulation
response, CIU responders and CIU nonresponders. We
have found that functional phenotypes are a durable
feature in subjects with active CIU and have linked the
degranulation patterns to the expression of the negative
regulatory phosphatases, SHIP-1 and SHIP-2. We also
provide evidence that the increased expression of these
phosphatases in CIU NR basophils impairs PIP3 generation.
The mechanism leading to altered basophil functional phenotype is not readily apparent, but appears independent of
serum HRA, the presence of circulating FceRIa antibodies,
or Syk deficiency.
