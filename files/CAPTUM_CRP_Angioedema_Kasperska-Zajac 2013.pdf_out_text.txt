Abstract

Background Active chronic urticaria, identified as a mast cell- and basophil-dependent inflammatory disorder of
the skin is able to elicit acute phase response (APR). However, systemic inflammatory response in different types of
urticaria is poorly characterized.

Aim To determine APR pattern in a clearly defined group of patients with acute urticaria and/or angioedema —
induced by NSAIDs.

Methods Plasma IL-6 and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were studied in 17 patients with
NSAIDs-induced acute urticaria/angioedema (NSAIDSAU) and in 20 healthy controls. Eleven patients who used
NSAIDs were presented at the emergency room with acute urticaria/angioedema while the remaining six manifested
the symptoms during the aspirin challenge test. Patients were examined in a dynamic manner: during the acute
phase, and next, after subsidence of the symptoms.

Results CRP and IL-6 concentrations increased significantly in patients with NSAIDSAU as compared with
their asymptomatic period and the healthy subjects. In addition, NSAIDsAU patients showed elevated
concentration of the biomarkers following aspirin provocation with the baseline values recovered in the
asymptomatic period.

Conclusion These results indicate that an acute systemic inflammatory response is activated in patients with
NSAIDs-induced urticaria and/or angioedema. The study supports the evidence proving that up-regulation of CRP
and IL-6 in urticaria/angioedema does not necessarily reflect any concomitant infection or other inflammatory
processes, but may be due to the disease itself.

Introduction
Urticaria/angioedema are the most common non-allergic hypersensitivity reactions caused and/or aggravated by aspirin and other
NSAIDs drugs.!

Interestingly, it has been indicated that active chronic spontaneous urticaria may cause a low-grade of acute phase response
(APR).”? There are two key players of APR: interleukin-6 (IL-6) performs as a major determinant of the reaction, required for induction

acute phase proteins, while the included C-reactive protein (CRP) is
a sensitive clinical marker of a systemic inflammatory response.*”

Yet, the data available regarding activation of systemic inflammatory response in the course of acute urticaria as well as physical
urticarias appear scarce and inconclusive.’

Therefore, the study was performed to determine plasma IL-6
and serum CRP concentrations in a clearly defined group of
patients with acute urticaria/angioedema induced by NSAIDs

(NSAIDsAU) as well as to assess the APR pattern changes following the aspirin provocation test.

Materials and methods

Patients

Seventeen patients with NSAIDsAU (Table 1). The drugs above
were administered to treat acute pain. Eleven of the patients had
confirmed history of at least two episodes of reactions to more
than one NSAID. The remaining six had a clinical history of only
one episode of acute urticaria/angioedema induced by the drugs;
therefore the aspirin challenge test was performed to confirm the
diagnosis.

All the patients developed a moderate-severe reaction, according
to a daily urticarial activity score.° The patients received steroids
and/or antihistamines with resolution of the symptoms during
several hours.

The exclusion criteria included: (i) acute urticaria/angioedema
episodes other than those induced by NSAIDs; (ii) other phenotypes of NSAIDs hypersensitivity; (iii) history of infection during
the preceding 1 month; (iv) chronic diseases; (v) treatment with
any medication in the preceding 2 months.

The control group consisted of 20 sex- and age-matched healthy
subjects.

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Medical University of Silesia.

Blood sampling
Peripheral venous blood for CRP and IL-6 assay was obtained
according two different protocols.

Kasperska-Zajac et al.

Protocol | — patients who underwent the aspirin challenge
test following the EAACI/GA2LEN guidelines’ Briefly, the
challenges were performed 1 day after the administration of placebo, at hourly intervals by progressive, oral administration of
aspirin 71, 117 and 312, reaching the cumulative dose of 500 mg
or appearance of a positive reaction. Skin/mucosa changes, vital
signs, and forced expiratory value 1 s (FEV) were recorded. The
unequivocal development of urticaria and/or angioedema was
regarded as a positive reaction for diagnosis of NSAIDs hypersensitivity manifested by urticaria/angioedema.

Blood samples were obtained three times: (i) before aspirin
provocation; (ii) 24 h following the onset of a positive reaction —
the acute phase; and (iii) again 1 month after resolution of the
symptoms.

 

In addition samples were taken during the placebo administration: (i) in the morning before the provocation; and (ii) 24 h after
(directly before the aspirin challenge).

Protocol Il - patients without the aspirin challenge test.
(who reported NSAIDsAU at emergency rooms of Allergology,
Dermatology and Laryngology).

Blood samples were taken twice from all the patients: (i) first,
during the acute phase of the disease before the treatment was
administered (several hours after the onset of symptoms); (ii) secondly, 1 month following the subsidence of symptoms.

In vitro assays

Plasma IL-6 concentration was determined by ELISA (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). Sensitivity of the assay was
0.70 pg/mL.

Acute phase inflammatory markers in patients with NSAIDsSAU 3

Serum CRP concentration was measured by an automated turbidimetric latex agglutination method (CRP-Latex, BioSystems
SA, Barcelona, Spain) with a detection limit of 1.0 mg/L. Elevated
serum CRP was defined as higher than 5.0 mg/L.

Statistical analysis

The analysis was made using Kruskal-Wallis test as well as MannWhitney U test. Correlation coefficient was obtained by Spearman
test. P values lower than 0.05 were considered significant.

Results

Plasma concentration of IL-6 was significantly higher in patients
with NSAIDsAU (as a whole group, n = 17) as compared with the
values at the asymptomatic period (one month after subsidence of
the lesions) and with the healthy subjects (median and range: 1.9
(1.7-2.4) vs. 0.9 (0.8-1.2) vs. 1.05 (0.7-1.25) pg/mL, respectively;
P< 0.001) (Fig. 1).

Figure 2 Individual serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration in healthy subjects and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs-induced acute urticaria/angioedema (NSAIDsAU) patients
during the acute phase and remission of the symptoms. Horizontal lines represent median value.

Serum concentration of CRP was significantly higher in patients
with NSAIDsAU (as a whole group, n = 17) as compared with
their the values at the asymptomatic period (one month after
cleaning of the lesions) and with the healthy subjects (median and
range: 20.5 (14.6-26.4) vs. 1.2 (1.0-2.1) vs. 1.4 (1.15-1.75) mg/L,
respectively; P < 0.001) (Fig. 2).

A total of 15 patients out of 17 showed CRP concentrations
above the normal range upper limit at the time the active period,
to recover the normal values upon the second examination. In the
other two patients with angioedema symptoms only serum CRP
concentration was within the normal lab range.

Significant correlation was found between concentrations of
IL-6 and CRP (r=0.91, P< 0.001) in urticaria/angioedema
patients.

Changes in plasma IL-6 and serum CRP concentration
following the aspirin challenge test

The median plasma IL-6 concentrations increased from 1.0 pg/mL
(range: 0.9-1.2) to 2.2 pg/mL (range: 1.9-4.1, P < 0.01) during
24 h to recover then the baseline value of 0.95 pg/mL (range: 0.8—
1.0).

The median serum CRP concentrations increased significantly
from 1.2 mg/L (range: 1.0-1.3) to 23.7 mg/L (range: 20.5-36.5;
P < 0.01) 1 day after the provocation and then returned to the
baseline values 1.15 mg/L (range: 1.0-1.3). One day after the
provocation all the patients showed markedly increased CRP concentration (3-8 fold) above the upper limit of the normal range
(Fig. 3).

The APR markers were not affected by placebo (1.15 vs.
1.0 pg/mL and 1.1 vs. 1.2 mg/L; for IL-6 and CRP, respectively).

Discussion
Our results indicate that patients with NSAIDsAU had significantly elevated concentrations of plasma IL-6 and serum CRP.

So far, increased concentrations of the APR biomarkers have
been observed in patients with spontaneous chronic urticaria,”*""!
acute severe urticaria'* or delayed pressure urticaria (DPU).’° It is
worth noting that CRP values in some urticaria/angioedema
patients, such as those recorded upon infection, e.g. some viral
(2040 mg/L). This interesting observation calls however for very careful interpretation of CRP value in such cases. Increased CRP in
acute urticaria appears then not only as a concomitant infection
but first of all points to high activity of the urticarial inflammation
itself.

The current study describes increased plasma concentration of
IL-6 in patients with NSAIDsAU. So far, only one study described
the activity of APR markers in the course of acute urticaria
induced by various drugs (NSAIDs, antibiotics, analgetics).'* In

infections, are associated with modest CRP elevation

the study, the majority of patients confirmed the use of more than
one drug from different groups, before urticaria onset,'* which is
an obstacle to direct comparison with our results.

A significant correlation was found between concentrations
of IL-6 and CRP in NSAIDsAU, indicating the importance of IL-6
in determination of the circulating CRP concentration in the
disease.

Available data regarding the behaviour of APR markers in
angioedema are scarce and the results appear inconclusive. Bas
et al. reported that patients treated with angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) exhibited increased plasma levels of
CRP in contrast to patients with angioedema of unknown
causes.'> In another study, none of the patients with ACEIsinduced angioedema exhibited elevation of serum CRP concentration.'° Yet, Takahagi et al. observed increased concentration of
CRP in some patients with idiopathic angioedema.” We observed
that patients with NSAIDs-induced angioedema without urticaria
symptoms showed remarkable increase of the values (2-4 fold
above the upper limit). However, two of six patients did not
exceed the normal value. The patients did not demonstrate any
massive angioedema.

Taken together, we speculate that the degree of APR activation
in angioedema alone depends first of all, on the extent of angioedema symptoms as well as an individual predisposition to CRP
response. Different genetic and non-genetic factors may determine
the basal and stimulated concentrations of CRP during the infectious or inflammatory processes.'”

Indeed, the putative mechanism of this disorder is believed to
link with inhibition of cycloxygenase-1 (COX-1) and formation of
leukotrienes. We speculate, however that increased APR is associated with non-specific urticarial inflammation resulting from activation of mast cells and other inflammatory cells involved in the
process. Similarly to chronic spontaneous urticaria or DPU. Leukotrienes might however act as additional proinflammatory factors
intensifying this response. In addition, APR markers, especially
IL-6, maybe involved in amplification of urticarial inflammation
(for review 3).

Kasperska-Zajac et al.

There have been several limitations of our study. The first was
the small size of our study group during the aspirin provocation
test. It should be noted however that an evident growth of the
APR biomarkers concentration was observed following the challenge, despite medication, including the anti-inflammatory drugs,
received upon appearance of the symptoms. No other procedure
was available in such case, as no treatment applied would have
been unethical. Secondly, no serial marking was performed; therefore we are not able to define the peak of the inflammatory
response or the exact time when the markers recovered their baseline levels. Such markings seem unjustified in our schemes as the
patients had received medication before which might have affected
the results. Next, lacking observations during the early postprovocation hours (up to first 6-8 h), further studies focused on the
early inflammatory response are needed. In addition, it was not
possible to obtain blood samples from all the subjects at the same
time after the symptoms onset. This however should not deny the
objective of our study which is consistent with the dynamic pattern of CRP behaviour following an acute stimulus. A growth
above the normal limits is reached within 6 h, peaking after 48—
50 h, and recovering the normal value during 3—7 days following
the stimulus withdrawal (plasma half-life about 19 h)8

The results indicate that an acute systemic inflammatory
response is activated in NSAIDs-induced acute urticaria/angioedema, manifested by raised circulating concentrations of APR
markers. The study supports the evidence proving that up-regulation of CRP and IL-6 in urticaria/angioedema does not necessarily
reflect the concomitant infection or any other inflammatory process, but may occur due to the disease itself.
