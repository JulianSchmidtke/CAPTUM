Dear Editor,

Patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), frequently present poor response to second
generation H1 antihistamines and severely impaired quality of life. Despite the recommended
up-dosing of H1 antihistamines, many patients remain symptomatic. Omalizumab, a
recombinant, humanized anti-immunoglobulin-E antibody, was approved for the treatment of

CSU in adults and adolescents, who do not respond to antihistamines (Zuberbier, 2018).

A total of 29 consecutively selected patients with severe and resistant CSU, who were started on
omalizumab, were enrolled in this prospective, observational study. Included subjects were aged
> 18 years, had severe CSU defined as 7-day Urticaria Activity Score (UAS-7) > 30, and were
unresponsive to oral H1-blocking antihistamines at up to four times the licensed dose. Patients

with inducible chronic urticaria were excluded.

UAS-7 and concomitant medication score (CMS) were assessed at baseline, at 4, 12, 24 and 36
week. The UAS-7 is a validated tool used to assess urticaria severity. Use of concomitant
medications was documented and adjusted at every visit according to the clinical response. CMS
was calculated as following: antihistamines (regular dose, 2 points; 4 times the regular dose, 8
points), oral prednisone (<11 mg, 5 points; 11-25 mg, 10 points; >25 mg, 15 points),
cyclosporine 3.0 mg/kg daily (8 points), hydroxychloroquine (6 points) and montelukast (2

points). Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) was performed at baseline, at 12 and 36 week.

Patients were treated with subcutaneous omalizumab, at a dose of 300mg every 4 weeks. Even in
patients with complete or partial response during the 36 weeks of observation, neither

discontinuation nor dose or interval adjustment was tried, since this is our common clinical

practice. Based on omalizumab responses, outcomes were classified as complete (UAS-7 = 0),
partial (UAS-7 = 1 - 28) or no response (UAS-7 = 29 - 42). Adverse events were documented.

Ethics board approval and written informed consent were provided.

 

There was a female predominance in our sample (n = 23). The mean age was 48.65+19.07 years
and the median disease duration was 6.0 (2.0-75.0) months. 27.6% (n = 8) of the patients
suffered from angioedema. All patients had been previously treated with H1-antihistamines,

while 96.6% of the patients had received systemic steroids.

UAS-7, CMS and DLQI were significantly decreased during the weeks of evaluation (Table 1).
The proportion of patients who achieved complete remission was 24.1% (n = 7) at week 4 and
72.4% (n = 21) at week 36 (Figure 1). 20.7% (n= 6) of the patients showed improvement but did
not achieve complete remission by week 36, while 6.9% (n = 2) of the patients showed no
response till week 36. None of the patients had a relapse, after he/she had achieved complete
remission. The proportion of patients who required concomitant medication was 89.7% (n = 26)
at week 4 and 24.1 (n = 7) at week 36 (Figure 2). No adverse events were reported during the

study.

Almost 40% of patients have histamine-releasing IgG autoantibodies against IgE or against the
high affinity IgE receptor on mast cells and basophils (Chang, 2015). Omalizumab binds to free
IgE, preventing IgE from binding to IgE receptors and thus triggering a down-regulation of
FceR1 receptors. Although the exact mechanism is not fully understood, its efficacy has been

shown (Bernstein, 2018; Kaplan, 2013; Maurer, 2013; Saini, 2015).

Data on individualization of treatment with dose adjustments or treatment intervals during the

long-term management of CSU needs to be further elucidated (Curto-Barredo, 2018; Pinto

Gouveia, 2017). In our study, treatment with omalizumab achieved control of the disease with a
relevant quality of life improvement. However, it is important to follow-up with patients after the

end of omalizumab cycles to evaluate the real remission of CSU.
