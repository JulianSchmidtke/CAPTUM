Background. Recent data indicate that the autologous serum skin test (ASST) shows
a high rate of reactivity not only in chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) but also in cases
with non-allergic asthma and rhinitis (NAAR), multiple drug allergy syndrome

Aim. To evaluate ASST reactivity in patients with CIU, allergic/non-allergic asthma

Methods. We studied 80 patients with CIU, 40 non-atopic patients with NAAR, 57
patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and allergic bronchial asthma (ABA), and 45
healthy controls. ASST was performed in all patients and controls, and it was considered positive when a serum-induced weal with a diameter 1.5 mm greater than the

Results. In total, 42 patients with CIU showed ASST reactivity (52.5%). ASST was
found to be positive in 8 of 40 patients with NAAR (20%). The rate was similar
(17.5%) in the AR/ABA patient group. However, 25 healthy controls (55.5%) also had
positive ASST. The highest rate was in female controls and in individuals in the 18—30
Conclusion. The data indicate that ASST positivity might be a nonspecific phenomenon, influenced by many factors. In the light of the results of this study, we
suggest that the significance of ASST reactivity should be re-evaluated in CIU. In
addition, the importance of ASST reactivity in patients with AR/ABA and in patients
with NAAR remains unclear, and further controlled studies are needed.

intrinsic, nonallergic origin are described as ‘nonallergic asthma and rhinitis’ (NAAR). From an immunohistopathological point of view, NAAR and respiratory
allergic diseases are similar. There are some preliminary studies in the literature revealing high rates of
ASST reactivity in NAAR.”* These have been based on
the hypothesis that NAAR, characterized by allergylike symptoms without evidence of an IgE-mediated
sensitization, can be regarded as the respiratory
counterpart of CIU.”

It is well known that patients with allergic BA are
characterized by predominant activation of T-helper
(Th)2 lymphocytes, with increased production of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13.*°:!° Nonallergic asthma is
also an inflammatory airway disease immunologically
characterized by increased expression of IL-2 and IL-5
(not Th2 cytokines).!!!? Similarly, infiltrating T lymphocytes in CU are a mixture of Th1/Th2 cell types or
show a ThO phenotype (Il-4, IL-5 and interferon-y
mRNA +cells).13:14

In this study, we aimed to show and re-evaluate the
significance of ASST reactivity in three patient groups
(CIU, NAAR, AR/ABA) and healthy controls.

Methods

This study was carried out between 2004 and 2006
in the allergy and dermatology clinics of Giilhane
Medical Academy. In total, 80 patients with CIU (46
men and 34 women; mean age 34.74 + 14.94, range
11-67), 40 nonatopic patients with NAAR (13 men
and 27 women; mean age 35.53 + 13.15, range
12-67), 57 patients with AR/ABA (41 men and 16
women; mean age 26.89 + 6.76, range 16-48), and
45 healthy nonatopic controls (22 men and 23
women; mean age 30.04 + 7.83, range 18-44) were

studied (Table 1). The control group had no history of
atopy (atopic respiratory disease, atopic dermatitis or
food allergy), urticaria, nonatopic respiratory disease,
or any drug allergy and/or intolerance. Antihistamines were withdrawn from anyone using them at
least 1 week before skin testing was performed.
The exclusion criteria for patients with CIU were:
presence of multiple drug allergy syndrome (MDAS),
pregnancy, pure physical urticaria, and urticaria
lasting < 6 weeks. Exclusion criteria for patients with
AR/ABA, patients with NAAR and healthy controls
were: presence of MDAS, multiple intolerances to
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and
pregnancy.

Patients with rhinitis and asthma were diagnosed as
having AR/ABA or NAAR on the basis of clinical
history, nasal smear, blood eosinophil count, serum
total IgE concentration, pulmonary function tests and
skin-prick and/or intradermal tests. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) workshop report and the
Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA)
document were considered as diagnostic criteria!*'° for
AR/ABA and NAAR. After obtaining written informed
consent, all patients and controls underwent skin-prick
testing (SPT) with a panel of 40 inhalant allergens
including house dust mites, cockroach, animal epithelia
and feathers, grass/tree/weed pollens, moulds and
cockroach (Stallergenes, Antony, France).

We performed an intradermal test with fresh autologous serum on the 222 subjects (177 patients with
CIU, NAAR, or AR/ABA, and 45 healthy controls).
Venous blood samples were drawn into sterile tubes
without clotting accelerator (Vacuette; Greiner Bio-One
GmBH, Kremsmiinster, Austria). After the blood samples were allowed to clot at room temperature for
30 min, they were centrifuged at 500 g for 15 min in
order to separate the sera. All ASSTs were performed
and evaluated by the same two investigators (OT and
AK).

Autologous serum (0.05 mL) and 0.9% sterile saline
(negative control) were injected into the volar aspect of
the forearm. The result was evaluated after 30 min, and
judged to be positive when a serum-induced weal with a
diameter of 1.5 mm greater than the negative control,
surrounded by an erythema, was present.

Statistical analysis

The 7° test, Mann-Whitney U-test and logistic regression analysis were used with SPSS software (version
13.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). P < 0.05 was
considered significant.

Results

Skin-prick test

The NAAR group comprised 40 SPT-negative patients:
29 with pure non-allergic rhinitis (NAR) and 11 with
NAR/BAs. There were 27 patients with AR and 30 with
AR associated with ABA patients in the AR/ABA group.
There was no patient with pure BA in either group. SPT
with inhalant allergens gave a positive result for at least
one inhalant allergen in all patients with AR/ABA, and
35% of patients with CIU also had SPT reactivity. None
of the healthy controls had a positive reaction to SPT
with inhalant allergens.

Autologous serum skin test

In total, 42 patients with CIU (52.5%) showed ASST
reactivity. However, 25 healthy controls (55.5%) also
had a positive ASST (Table 1). The difference between
patients with CIU and healthy controls was not significant (P > 0.05).

Autologous serum skin test was found to be positive
in 8 of 40 patients with NAAR (20%) and 10 of 57
patients with AR/ABA (17.5%) (Table 1). There was no
significant difference between NAAR and AR/ABA
patients for ASST positivity (P > 0.05).

The highest rate of ASST positivity was found in
women; almost 70% of healthy women had a positive
ASST. Female gender was found to be more frequently
associated with ASST positivity in all groups (Table 1).
In addition, eight female controls still had ASST
positivity 6 months after the completion of the study.
The frequency of ASST positivity was found to be higher
in patients and controls for the age group 18-30 years.

In all, 41 of 122 men (33.6%) and 44 of 100 women
(44%) had positive ASST. The overall rate of ASST
positivity in the patient groups (CIU, NAAR, AR/ABA)
was 33.9% (60 of 177 patients), but 55.5% of controls
(25 of 45 healthy people) had a positive ASST. As
emphasized above, patients with NAAR had a low rate
of ASST positivity (20%). This rate was comparable with
that obtained in the AR/ABA group (17.54%).

Discussion

Autologous serum skin test positivity, first described by
Grattan et al., has been suggested to indicate the presence
of functional histamine-releasing autoantibodies or histamine-releasing factors in some patients with CIU.! It
has been suggested that ASST positivity in patients with
CIU might indicate the presence of functional circulating

autoantibodies to FceRI and/or to IgE, with a sensitivity
of 65-71% and a specificity of 78-81%.?'” Although its
sensitivity and specificity for basophil histamine release
were found by Grattan et al. to be high, the test is not
considered specific for autoimmune urticaria. In addition,
recent data indicate that the ASST shows a high rate of
reactivity not only in CIU, but also in patients with
NAAR,’ those with multiple intolerances to NSAIDs,'*
and those with MDAS.!?

Asero et al. 2° showed that the autologous plasma
skin test yielded more positive results than ASST in CIU.
Moreover, the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation
cascade, which possibly leads to thrombin generation,
was found by the same group to be activated in plasma
samples from patients with CIU. This strong expression
of tissue factor by upper dermal inflammatory cells,
providing evidence of coagulation pathway involvement
in CIU, presented new perspectives.7!

The ASST shows the highest rate of positivity (>90%)
in MDAS, a condition characterized by a marked
tendency to react to several chemically unrelated drugs.
Almost 90% positivity has also been found in patients
with multiple NSAID sensitivity.'* These findings suggest that MDAS and multiple NSAID sensitivity are
characterized by the presence of histamine-releasing
factors.

To our knowledge, our study is one of the most
detailed undertaken on ASST in different patient groups.
We performed an intradermal test with fresh autologous
serum on 222 people (177 patients of CIU, NAAR or
AR/ABA, and 45 healthy controls). In contrast to
previous reports, we found that patients with NAAR
had a low rate of ASST positivity (20%). A large number
of controls (55.5%) also had a positive ASST, which was
higher even than that found in the CIU patient group
(52.5%).

Although it is generally regarded as a useful clinical
procedure, there have been some reports that falsepositive results might be seen in ASST. Bradykinin
production and C5a formation during the clotting
process have been put forward as causes for false
positivity.'* However, as there are no clear data
regarding false-positive reactions in ASST, the significance and the rate of false positivity remain unknown.
There are also no data available on whether the serumcollecting procedure [fasting, activity of the disease at
the time of blood drawing, rate (g value) and duration of
spinning in the centrifuge] influences the results. In the
literature, there are large variations, with rates of
positivity ranging from 0% to 45% among healthy
controls. Table 2 shows the positive ASST results for
healthy people reported in the literature.”°-17-19:27-23

It is difficult to interpret zero,*!? low!” ? and high”?
rates of ASST reactivities in healthy populations. As
shown in Table 2, Mari’ and Guttman-Yassky et al.??
have reported 45% and 40.5% positivity, respectively, in
healthy controls. Our results represent the highest rate
(55.55%) of ASST reactivity in a healthy adult population; almost 70% in healthy women. In general, ASST
was more often found to be positive in women than in
men.”"* The fact that the rate of positivity was highest in
the young (female) population, age range 18-30 years,
in our study suggests the role of immune status and
female sexuality (e.g. hormonal factors, menstrual cycle)
in ASST reactivity. The fact that eight female controls
had still ASST positivity at the end of the sixth month
after completion of the study supports this view.

Although high rates of ASST reactivity almost similar
to those detected in CIU have been reported in some
NAAR patient groups,”* the data obtained from our
study are not consistent with the data of previous studies
(Table 2). Our results (high rate of ASST positivity in
healthy controls, low rate of positivity in AR/ABA and
NAAR) cast doubt on the suggestion that ASST might
reflect minimal persistent inflammation.”+?°> In addition, the hypotheses that circulating histamine-releasing
factors that might contribute to the inflammatory
process in NAAR by activating pulmonary mast cells,
and that a common autoreactivity may be operative in
both CIU and AR/ABA and NAAR via chronic activation
of mast cells*?* seem highly controversial on the basis of
the results of present study. Recent data in patient and
control groups indicate that ASST positivity might be a
nonspecific phenomenon, influenced by many factors.

In the light of the results of this study, we suggest that
the significance of ASST should be re-evaluated in CIU.
In addition, the importance of ASST in patients with
AR/ABA and patients with NAAR remains unclear,
and further controlled studies are needed.
