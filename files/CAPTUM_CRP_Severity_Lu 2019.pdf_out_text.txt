Abstract: BACKGROUND: Serum amyloid A is an acute-phase protein. There is no available data regarding serum amyloid A
levels in patients with acute (AU) and chronic urticaria (CU).

Osjective: To investigate the association between serum amyloid A and urticaria.

Metxops: This was a case-control study of 81 patients who visited our Hospital between June and December 2016 with a
diagnosis of urticaria. Eighty healthy controls (HC) who visited for routine health examination and physical checkups were
recruited. Serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein levels were measured by automated methods.

Resutts: Serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in AU (Serum amyloid A: 207.1 (6.7-439.0)
mg/L; C-reactive protein: 16.0 (0.2-90.0) mg/L) and CU (Serum amyloid A: 6.5 (2.5-35.8) mg/L; C-reactive protein: 1.0 (0.116.0) mg/L) compared with HC (Serum amyloid A: 5.04 (2.0-9.1) mg/L; C-reactive protein: 1.2 (0.1-5.6) mg/L), and in AU
compared with CU (all P<0.05). There were no differences between the CU and HC group. In CU, Serum amyloid A levels in
those with moderate/severe urticaria (median, 16.4 (9.7-35.8) mg/L) were higher than in those with mild urticaria (median, 5.7
(2.5-9.5) mg/L) and HC (all P<0.05). Serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein levels exceeded the normal lab range in 90.7%
and 72.1% patients with AU compared with 28.9% and 13.2% patients with CU, respectively. Significant positive correlations
were found between serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein (r = 0.562, P < 0.001).

Stupy LIMITATIONS: There was no comparison between active disease and remission.

Conc usion: There was an association between serum amyloid A levels and urticaria. Higher serum amyloid A levels were
associated with AU and more severe CU. Serum amyloid A may help to identify CU patients earlier.

Keywords: C-reactive protein; Serum amyloid A protein; Urticaria

INTRODUCTION

Urticaria is a disease defined by the appearance of pruritic (less than 6 weeks) and its most common causes include allergic reswheals and/or angioedemas.'* The peak age for onset in adults is ponse, infection, and drugs. Some cases may be idiopathic.*>” AU is
between 20 and 40 years.’ A population-based questionnaire survey mostly related to mast cell and basophil activation caused by several

CU can be identified as an inflammatory disorder of the skin, which
is accompanied by an acute phase response (APR).? APR is a local
and systemic coordinated reaction to environmental insults that are
harmful to the host, including infections, inflammatory processes,
and tissue injury. The main biochemical features of APR are numerous changes in the levels of several circulating proteins, including
C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), haptoglobin, and
fibrinogen."

SAA is an acute-phase protein of about 12 kDa in size. SAA
is primarily synthesized in the liver by activated monocytes and
macrophages and is secreted from certain extrahepatic sites in chronic inflammatory diseases.'? Circulatory SAA levels were reported
to raise dramatically during acute phase reactions in response to
a trauma or infection.’ SAA was also shown to exhibit important
immunological functions in the process of inflammation.’ However, the association between SAA and urticaria (both AU and CU)
is unclear.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate
the association between SAA and urticaria. SAA could be used as a

disease marker to monitor urticaria.

METHODS

Study design and patients

This was a case-control study. We prospectively recruited 81
patients who visited the dermatology clinic of our hospital between
June 2016 and December 2016 with a diagnosis of urticaria. AU was
defined by lesion recurrence over a period of shorter than 6 weeks.
CU was defined as wheals that had been continuously or intermittently occurring for at least 6 weeks.'* The main cause of urticaria in
these patients was an allergic reaction such as to medication, insect
bites, or food. There were no obvious causes for about half of the
cases.

We recruited 80 healthy controls (HC) who visited our hospital for routine health examination and physical checkups. All participants were older than 18 years old.

Exclusion criteria included: 1) patients who have taken antidepressants or oral corticosteroids within 2 months; 2) patients who
have taken antihistamines within at least 4 days before the study; or
3) skin test or other investigations revealing concomitant diseases.
Routine investigations and consultations were performed to exclude infectious diseases. Patients with other chronic skin diseases and
those with clinical evidence of urticarial vasculitis or inflammatory
state (including rheumatoid arthritis and lupus) were excluded.

The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of our hospital. Informed written consent was obtained from all
participants.

Urticaria activity

The urticaria activity score (UAS), defined by the EAACI/
GA°LEN/EDF guideline,? was determined over 4 days and on the
day of blood sampling: (no wheals = 0; 1-10 wheals = 1; 11-50 wheals
= 2; and > 50 wheals = 3) and pruritus intensity (no = 0; mild = 1;
moderate = 2; and severe = 3). The UAS scores were determined as
daily (minimum = 0; and maximum = 6) and over 4 days (sum of
the daily score values; minimum = 0; maximum = 24). The UAS was
graded as: mild (0-8), moderate (9-16), and severe (17-24).

Blood collection

All blood samples were obtained between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.
by antecubital puncture. Serum was obtained by centrifugation at
3000 rpm for 5 min. and subsequently stored at -80°C until analysis.

SAA and CRP levels

SAA levels were measured by latex enhanced immunoturbidimetric method on Architect c16000 platform (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA) with a detection limit of 5 mg/L and a
reference range of 0-10 mg/L. Serum CRP levels were measured by
immunoturbidimetry, with a detection limit of 0.1 mg/L. Elevated
serum CRP was defined as > 5.0 mg/L.

Statistical analysis

Continuous data was expressed as median and ranges. We
used Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, and Student t tests to screen
for differences among the groups, when appropriate. The Pearson
correlation coefficient was used to examine the relationships between the variables. Two-sided p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS 17.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).

RESULTS

Clinical characteristics of study participants

Eighty-one patients participated in this study. Of them, 43
were classified as AU (27 women and 16 men; mean age of 34.7, 1874 years) and 38 as CU (22 women and 16 men; mean age of 42.8,
22-64 years). The HC group consisted of 80 healthy individuals (46
women and 34 men) of comparable age (38.5, 19-74 years) and body
mass index (BMI) (Table 1). There were no significant differences in
the baseline variables (age, gender, and BMI).

SAA levels in AU and CU patients

SAA and CRP levels were significantly higher in AU patients
(SAA: 207.1 (6.7-439.0) mg/L; CRP: 16.0 (0.2-90.0) mg/L) than in CU
patients (SAA: 6.5 (2.5-35.8) mg/L; CRP: 1.0 (0.1-16.0) mg/L) and HC
(SAA: 5.0 (2.0-9.1) mg/L; CRP: 1.2 (0.1-5.6) mg/L) (all p < 0.05) (Figure 1). There were no differences between the CU and HC group.

Among patients with CU, SAA levels in those with moderate/severe UAS (16.4 (9.7-35.8) mg/L) were higher than in those
with mild UAS (5.7 (2.5-9.5) mg/L) and HC (5.0 (2.0-9.1) mg/L) (all
p < 0.05) (Figure 2). There were no differences between patients with
mild CU and HC.

In 39 patients (90.7%) with AU and 11 patients (28.9%) with
CU, SAA concentration exceeded the normal range upper limit
value (0-10 mg/L), and in 31 patients (72.1%) with AU and 5 patients (13.2%) with CU, the CRP concentration exceeded the normal-range upper limit value (0-5 mg/L). We observed a significant
difference in the proportion of SAA and CRP in patients with AU
and CU, (90.7% and 28.9%, %2 = 29.99, p < 0.001; 72.1% and 13.2%,
x2 = 26.04, p < 0.001, respectively). (Table 2).

Correlation between SAA and CRP levels

We found significant positive correlations between SAA and
CRP levels (r = 0.562, p < 0.0001) in patients with urticaria (Figure 3).

DISCUSSION
SAA is an acute-phase protein. Since there is no available
data regarding SAA levels in patients with urticaria, the aim of this

study was to investigate the association between SAA and urticaria.
The results revealed an association between SAA levels and urticaria.
Higher SAA levels were associated with AU and more severe CU.

Biological activities of SAA include transport of cholesterol
from dying cells to hepatocytes, inhibitory effect on fever, inhibitory effect on the oxidative reaction from neutrophilic granulocytes,
inhibitory effect on immune in vitro response, chemotoxic effect on T
cells, monocytes, leukocytes, neutrophils, and mast cells, induction
of calcium mobilization by monocytes, and inhibition of platelet
activation.'*"° Previous studies have indicated that SAA positively
correlates with disease activity/severity in ankylosing spondylitis,
juvenile idiopathic arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatic, and rheumatoid arthritis.'”°

To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to
show that SAA levels are elevated in patients with urticaria, particularly in patients with AU and moderate/severe CU. Previous studies
showed associations between CRP and urticaria, but not SAA. 7? In
the present study, SAA and CRP levels were correlated. Both proteins
are acute-phase proteins, which supports this correlation.

An Bras Dermatol. 2019;94(4):411-5.

Theoretically, higher SAA concentrations in patients with
urticaria could be explained by different mechanisms. It seems likely that similarly to other diseases, associated with the systemic
inflammatory response, SAA is primarily synthesized in the liver by
activated monocytes and macrophages in response to proinflammatory cytokines. Indeed, acute phase proteins are synthesized by the
liver in response to infection, trauma, or inflammation through the
action of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2,
and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a.°*

Chronic inflammation, perceived as a consecutive series of
separate inflammatory stimuli, usually shows increased levels of acute-phase proteins, but these levels are usually lower than the levels
observed in acute inflammation.” In addition, the response varies
among proteins.” In the present study, SAA levels were higher in AU,
followed by moderate/severe CU. Patients with mild CU had SAA
levels comparable to those of the HC group. In addition, using the
actual markers, CU is diagnosed after 6 weeks. SAA concentrations
exceeded the normal value in about 90.7% of patients with AU, which
was significantly higher than the 28.9% value observed in patients
with CU. SAA may help in the early detection of CU. This would
allow more timely treatments and a better prognosis.

The data indicated viral infections as potential triggers and
sometimes as a main causative agent of AU and CU.” SAA is a more
sensitive marker than CRP in infections with low inflammatory activity, including many viral infections.” Increased SAA concentrations
were observed despite the normal CRP concentrations, accounting
for 22.2% of all patient samples. The findings indicated that SAA was
more sensitive than CRP to detect infections with AU and CU. To
exclude other pathogenic factors, the increase in SAA concentration
alone may suggest a viral infection as the trigger of urticaria.

The present study is not without limitations. There was no
comparison between active disease and remission. Although it is
known that the levels of acute-phase proteins peak at 24-48 h after
symptom onset, our patients were recruited at different times after
the onset of symptoms.'> Nevertheless, we were able to detect some
significant differences in SAA levels between patients with urticaria
and HC.

CONCLUSION

We observed an association between SAA levels and urticaria. Higher SAA levels were associated with AU and more severe
CU. SAA levels may help in the early detection of CU.O
