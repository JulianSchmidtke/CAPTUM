Abstract

Background: Nonsedating antihistamines are the treatment
of choice for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), while
omalizumab and immunosuppressants have also been approved as an add-on treatment. Autologous whole-blood injection (AWBI) has been used in previous studies with ambiguous results. The aim of our study was to evaluate changes in the Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7), Dermatology Life
Quality Index (DLQI), and Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life
(CU-Q20L) score, and also the association of serologic markers with disease severity measures after AWBI. Methods: In
this observational study, AWBls were performed (8 courses
ona weekly basis) in adults with refractory CSU, who refused
an add-on treatment with either omalizumab or immunosuppressants. UAS7, DLQI, and CU-Q:0L questionnaires and
serum concentrations of total IgE, C-reactive protein (CRP),
and D-dimer were evaluated before and after the intervention. Results: Nineteen patients (12 females; mean age 54 +
20.8 years) completed the protocol. Following AWBI, signifi
cant improvements in the UAS7 (34.26 + 8.04 vs. 12.52 +
10.83, p < 0.001), DLQI (11.63 + 5.51 vs. 3.47 + 2.85, p< 0.001),
and CU-Q,oL score (32.97 + 18.71 vs. 10.94 + 7.71, p < 0.001)
were recorded. A negative correlation between the baseline
D-dimer levels and UAS7 and DLQI variations (p = 0.002 and
p = 0.001, respectively) was noted. D-dimer levels >292 ng/
mL have been associated with poor responsiveness (sensitivity 75%; specificity 83.3%). No correlation with either total
immunoglobulin E or CRP levels was observed. Conclusion:
AWBI appears to be a safe, alternative, add-on therapeutic
option in refractory CSU, particularly in patients with low

plasma levels of D-dimer. © 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a skin disorder characterized by the spontaneous eruption of shortlived (<24 h), cutaneous wheals accompanied by redness
and itching, with or without concomitant angioedema,
for a period of >6 weeks [1].

All data including the informed consent and the approval by the ethics committee are available upon request.

Several treatment options are available for CSU patients. H,-antihistamines are considered the “gold-standard” therapeutic approach, although refractory cases,
even with quadruple doses, have been reported [1]. Omalizumab isa chimeric anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) monoclonal antibody that binds to free IgE and downregulates
the function of mast cells and basophils. Recent metaanalysis has provided high-level evidence for the efficacy
and safety of omalizumab in patients with refractory CSU
[2]. Nevertheless, several issues with respect to anti-IgE
treatment are still of concern, such as the lack of evidence
for CSU immunomodulation or symptomatology recurrence following discontinuation [3, 4]. Although leukotriene antagonists are proposed in the European Academy
of Allergy and Clinical Immunology/Global Allergy and
Asthma European Network (EAACI/GA?LEN) guidelines in cases of refractory chronic urticaria, well-designed randomized controlled trials about their role in
CSU treatment are lacking [5]. In addition, corticosteroid
treatment is proposed only as a “short-bursts” intervention (maximum 10 days) in cases of unresponsiveness [1].
Finally, for other proposed anti-inflammatory agents
(dapsone) or immunosuppressants (cyclosporine), safety
issues of dose-related adverse side effects are of concern
[6].

Autologous whole-blood injection (AWBI) has been
proposed as a therapeutic intervention for the treatment
of CSU; there are conflicting results concerning its effectiveness, but it does not have severe side effects [7, 8].

Various laboratory markers have occasionally been associated with CSU severity. Data from earlier studies are
suggestive of an association of disease severity measures
with serum levels of total IgE, D-dimer and C-reactive
protein (CRP) [8-13].

The aim of our study was to determine the effectiveness of AWBI in patients with CSU unresponsive to treatment with H,-antihistamines, and also identify potential
associations of IgE, D-dimer, and CRP with disease sever
ity.

Material and Methods

Patients

We evaluated adult patients with physician diagnosed CSU,
unresponsive to treatment with second-generation Hj-antihistamines up to quadruple doses or reported side effects (somnolence,
anxiousness, and reduced work performance), who visited the outpatient Dermatology Clinic at the General University Hospital of
Larissa. CSU diagnosis was based on continuous or recurrent hives
with or without angioedema, lasting 26 weeks. Omalizumab and/
or immunomodulatory therapy were suggested to patients as a

DOT: 10.1159/000458152

first-choice add-on treatment, according to EAACI guidelines;
when this was refused, AWBI was offered as a second-choice addon therapy, following a detailed written and verbal description of
the procedure.

Exclusion criteria were: a personal history of reported food or
drug IgE-mediated reactions, chronic diseases, pregnancy or lactation during the study period, and the use of anticoagulants. Topical
or systemic corticosteroid treatment or other immunosuppressants were withheld 4 weeks prior to treatment.

Study Design

This was an observational study, performed between August
2013 and August 2015. At baseline, patients included in the AWBI
protocol were assessed by means of detailed questionnaires, clinical evaluation, and laboratory screening for secondary causes of
CSU. CSU severity was assessed by the Urticaria Activity Score 7
(UAS7), while for patients’ quality of life Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and the validated Greek version of Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire (CU-Q:oL) [3, 14, 15] were
applied. The aforementioned questionnaires were filled in by patients at baseline (week 0) and upon completion of the AWBI treatment.

Further evaluation included blood sampling for complete
blood count, including eosinophil count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A serum sample was obtained at baseline for renal,
liver, and thyroid function tests, and levels of total protein, albumin, C3, and C4. D-dimer, total IgE, and C-reactive protein (CRP)
levels were assessed both at baseline and following ABWI intervention. Moreover, evaluation for autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid
factor, antinuclear antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA) and
hepatitis infections was performed. An autologous serum skin test
(ASST) was performed at baseline, according to standardized
EAACI/GA’LEN protocol [16]. Urine/stool microscopy and culture and chest X-ray were performed in all cases, while anti-Helicobacter pylori antibodies (IgM, IgG) were determined in patients
with chronic gastric complaints. For atopy assessment, total IgE
levels and skin prick tests (ALK-Abell6) were used, using the standard proposed panel by GA?LEN [17]. Hj-antihistamines were
withheld 7 days prior to skin prick testing, wherever possible.

Within 1 week after screening, AWBIs were administered;
treatment duration was 8 weeks, including 1 intramuscular gluteal
injection of autologous whole blood per week (alternating sides),
according to the proposed methodology [7, 8]. Specifically, blood
was taken from the cubital vein and was injected intramuscularly
without further processing. The initial volume injected was 2.5 mL,
and 5 mL was administered subsequently. Antihistamines were
administered on a per-needed basis.

In order to assess disease activity, reevaluation by telephone
questionnaires was planned for 8 months after completion of the
intervention.

All patients provided written consent, and study procedures
were in accordance with the standards of the General University
Hospital of Larissa ethics committee.

 

 

 

Statistical Analysis

For statistical analysis, we used the Spearman p and the Pearson
r for bivariate correlations, the Pearson y’ test to compare qualitative variables, the Student f test for comparing means, and the
Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric testing. For the assessment of paired samples we used the paired-samples f test and the

Wilcoxon test, while the receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
curve was performed to determine patients’ D-dimer levels, which
corresponded to the highest specificity and sensitivity in relation
to patients’ treatment response. Normality of our data was assessed
by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the Shapiro-Wilk test. SPSS
v20.0 statistical software was used for all analyses and a was set to
0.05 to all calculations.

Results

Thirty patients were invited to participate in the study.
Nine of them refused the first-choice add-on treatment
due to skepticism for recently approved interventions,
while 2 dropped out due to needle-phobia.

Nineteen patients (12 females; mean age of 54 + 20.8
years) proceeded and completed the AWBI protocol. Investigation for underlying pathologies was negative in all
cases. Regarding the ASST results, 10 patients were ASST
positive. Patients’ baseline characteristics are listed in Table 1. Eight patients were able to discontinue antihistamines prior to treatment; 11 reported occasional use.

A significant improvement in patients’ UAS7 following AWBI treatment (34.26 + 8.04 vs. 12.52 + 10.83 before
and after AWBI, respectively, p < 0.001) was noted, while

10/19 patients presented a reduction of UAS7 228 units.
Corresponding significant improvements were noted for
DLQI (11.63 + 5.51 vs. 3.47 + 2.85, p < 0.001) and CUQooL (32.97 + 18.71 vs. 10.94 + 7.71, p < 0.001) before and

scores were not associated with either IgE and CRP levels,
or ASST positivity.

No significant associations were recorded for ASSTpositive patients with respect to treatment response, sex,
or D-dimer/IgE/CRP levels at baseline.

After the completion of AWBI treatment, 15 patients
reported complete disease remission, while in 4 patients
no notable difference was observed. With respect to antihistamine requirements, 7 patients reported a complete
discontinuation, 5 occasional and 3 daily use, but all in
significantly reduced doses compared to prior to the intervention (Table 1).

When patients were assessed by telephone questionnaire at 8 months post-intervention, no significant differentiation in the disease’s clinical course (compared to
immediately post-intervention) was identified.

Local side effects following the AWBI procedure were
reported in 3 patients (such as minimal local bleeding,
swelling and discomfort).

Discussion
In our study, no severe adverse side effects were re
ported for patients following AWBI for the treatment of
CSU. Furthermore, a considerable proportion of patients

 

AWBI for CSU Treatment

with refractory CSU to antihistamines presented with a
great improvement in their clinical symptoms and quality of life, as assessed by significant improvements in their
UAS7, DLQI, and CU-Q,oL scores. In addition, low Ddimer plasma levels correlated with treatment efficacy.
Higher disease activity prior to our intervention seemed
0 be related to greater treatment response. Elevated baseine D-dimer levels in our study were associated with
poor outcome, as assessed by the UAS7 variation following AWBI, in line with Asero et al. [18].

We did not observe differences with respect to the
reatment responses in ASST-positive and ASST-negaive patients, as opposed to previous reported results [8].

The pathogenesis of chronic urticaria involves both
he intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathway [13, 19,
20], although the precise underlying pathogenetic mechanisms are largely unknown. It is well established that
hrombin enhances vascular permeability, and activates
and degranulates mast cells, thus generating anaphylaoxin C5a [21].

The mechanism of action of AWBI in patients with
CSU is largely unknown. It has been suggested [8] that
AWBI could alter the immune response, from a Th2 toa
Thl pattern, based on previously reported efficacy in
ASST-positive patients, but we did not confirm such association. Moreover, documentation of a specific antigen

responsible for the induction of Th2 response has not
been achieved [22]. A second theory [23] supports the notion of potential induction of anti-idiotypes that might
contribute to the release of disease-triggering autoantibodies. Although such an approach is quite interesting,
further investigation is needed.

Since normalization of D-dimer values was not observed in the majority of patients after an 8-week followup, it is hypothesized that the observed effectiveness of
the method cannot be attributed to direct intervention
into the coagulation system.

Although a significant proportion of our patients remained asymptomatic after 8 months, this could be attributed to the natural course of the disease and not the

Weaknesses of this study were the lack of a control
group, due to ethical, logistic and financial reasons, and
the small sample size. In addition, withdrawal of antihistamines prior to treatment could have been a confounding factor for the final analysis, since any intervention
could potentially lead to disease improvement. Nevertheless, the observed high effectiveness of AWBI and the
safety of the method underscore the need to perform additional studies to further evaluate its therapeutic role in
CSU.

In conclusion, we have observed that AWBI could
serve as a safe, alternative, add-on therapeutic option for
patients with refractory CSU who are unresponsive to
conventional treatment with H,-antihistamines, espe
AWBI treatment per se.
