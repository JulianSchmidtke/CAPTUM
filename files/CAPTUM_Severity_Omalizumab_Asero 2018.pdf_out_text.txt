EFFICACY OF OMALIZUMAB 150 MG/MONTH AS A MAINTENANCE DOSE IN PATIENTS WITH SEVERE
CHRONIC SPONTANEOUS URTICARIA SHOWING A PROMPT AND COMPLETE RESPONSE TO THE DRUG

To the Editor
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a rather frequent disorder than may severely disturb patient’s

quality of life. Most patients respond properly to second generation antihistamines at a licensed or
at a higher than licensed dosage (1). However, a minority of patients seem insensitive to
antihistamine treatment at any dosage; for these subjects alternative treatments must be prescribed
to control the disease. The recent EAACI guidelines for the diagnosis and management of CSU
recommend Omalizumab, a humanized anti-lgE monoclonal antibody, as the first choice for such
patients in view of its excellent safety profile and the high rate of success (1). Phase three, double
blind, placebo-controlled studies (2-4) have identified a monthly dose of 300 mg as the optimal
dosage to treat antihistamine-resistant patients. Since the drug is not a disease-modifying one, a
large proportion of patients relapse after the treatment is stopped. The optimal duration of the
treatment has not been established yet, although recent studies have shown its safety and efficacy
up to 48 weeks (1 year) (5). However, some patients showing an excellent response to the drug
relapse even after such prolonged treatment period and need to be treated for longer times.
Nonetheless, recent studies have shown that omalizumab retreatment is effective and safe in

patients who responded to the initial treatment (6-8).

The Italian Medical Agency (AIFA; Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco) has established that in CSU
omalizumab can be given at the dose of 300 mg/month for 6 times, with the possibility to resume
the treatment for further 5 months in case of relapse after a stop of 2 or more months. After the end
of the second course the treatment is no longer reimbursed by the National Health Service and has
therefore to be stopped. Such policy raises several ethical and practical problems involving both
patients and doctors. The high cost of the drug and its unavailability outside the hospital
environment represent an important obstacle on one hand, while on the other hand doctors must
cope with the problem of being forced to prescribe much more toxic drugs, such as cyclosporine (1),
an off-label drug for CSU, in patients who experienced a complete response to omalizumab just
some months before. Although formal safety studies beyond 1 year of therapy with omalizumab in
CSU patient are currently missing, recent data from real life studies suggest that most patients with a
baseline severe CSU who relapse after 1 year of treatment can be treated for at least another year
(6). Further, it must be considered that in patients with severe asthma omalizumab treatment is not

subjected to any time restriction.

In view of the current Italian rules and to the unavailability of the drug beyond one year of
treatment, a prospective real-life study was started in order to investigate the effect of a reduction
of omalizumab dose to 150 mg/month as a maintenance therapy in relapsing patients showing a
complete response to the dose of 300 mg with the aim to prolong their treatment period as much as
possible. Notably, a monthly dose of 150 mg, although possibly less effective than 300 mg ina

proportion of patients (2-4), is currently employed in several settings (2,5,9).

The study was carried out on 14 patients (M/F 5/9; mean age 49,5 years, range37-71 years;
mean disease duration 51 months, range 2-200 months) with severe CSU (baseline UAS7 > 30)
unresponsive to antihistamines at a dose 3 times higher than the licensed dose and relapsing two
months after the completion of the first course of Omalizumab 300 mg/month for 6 months to

which they had shown a complete response (UAS7 < 6). All patients were classified as “early

responders” to omalizumab as the clinical effect of the drug was already evident within the first
month after the first administration. After resuming the treatment at the dose of 300 mg/month for
1 time to re-induce a complete response, patients were treated with 150 mg/month of omalizumab
as an add-on treatment to second generation antihistamine at a licensed dose and evaluated after 4
months of this therapeutic regimen. The response to the treatment at a reduced dosage was plotted
against disease duration, presence of angioedema, baseline UAS7 value, presence of thyroid
autoimmunity (either thyroperoxydase and/or thyroglobulin), and baseline levels of D-dimer, ESR,

and CRP.

All patients gave an informed written consent after having been clearly explained that the reduced
dosage of the drug had to be considered as off-label, and that the goal of the study was to
potentially prolong the duration of the treatment before considering a shift to more toxic drugs in

case of relapse. The study was approved by the internal Review Board of the Clinic.

The baseline features of the study patients along with the clinical response to the treatment
are shown in table 1. Seven out of 14 patients (50%) showed an ongoing complete control of the
disease (UAS7 < 6) despite halving the monthly dose of Omalizumab. In the remaining 7 patients the
dose reduction was associated with a worsening of the disease (UAS7 score between 7 and 21)
although in no case it returned to the baseline severity. The partial loss of response to the drug did
not depend on disease duration, presence of thyroid autoimmunity, or baseline ESR, CRP or D-dimer,
whereas it was associated with the baseline severity of the disease (P< 0.05). Also a history of
angioedema was much more frequent among those who worsened following the reduction of
omalizumab dosage (6/7, 86%) than in patients who maintained the control of the disease (2/7;

29%) but due to the small number of patients the difference did not reach the statistical significance.

Although studies on larger number of patients are needed to confirm these observations
and despite the limitation of being non-randomized, the present real-life study suggests that it is

possible to halve the costs of omalizumab maintenance treatment in about one half of patients with

severe CSU showing a prompt response to the drug at the dose of 300 mg/month without any loss of
clinical efficacy. Patients who worsen with a reduced dosage of omalizumab are in general those
showing a more severe diseases at baseline as well as those with a history of angioedema associated
with the wheals. This is in keeping with previous observations that in patients with angioedema only
the dosage of 300 mg/month seems to be effective (2) Whether the reduction of omalizumab
dosage as a maintenance therapy will work also in patients showing a delayed response to the drug
remains to be established. In conclusion, this study confirms previous observations in a very small
number of patients (10) that a maintenance monthly dose of 150 mg of omalizumab may be
sufficient to guarantee an ongoing control of the disease in a large proportion of CSU patients

showing an early response to the drug.
