Thyroid antibodies are frequently observed in urticaria patients, but their roles in urticaria
are not clearly elucidated. We investigated the role of serum specific IgE to thyroid
peroxidase (TPO) in patients with aspirin intolerant acute urticaria (AIAU) and aspirin
intolerant chronic urticaria (AICU). We recruited 59 AIAU and 96 AICU patients with 69
normal controls (NC). Serum specific IgE to TPO was measured by manual direct ELISA, and

CD203c expressions on basophil with additions of TPO were measured to prove a direct role

INTRODUCTION

Urticaria is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by
wheals and flares accompanied with or without angioedema.
Aspirin/NSAIDs are the major drugs to provoke acute urticaria
called aspirin intolerant acute urticaria (AIAU) and exacerbate
urticaria in patients with chronic urticaria, called aspirin intolerant chronic urticaria (AICU). Usually, aspirin induced urticaria patients could have a more severe and chronic disease
course. Three have been some cases of aspirin intolerant acute
urticaria progressed to aspirin intolerant chronic urticaria (1).
Although the dysregulation of arachidonic acid metabolism
which are a suppression of prostaglandin and a relative overproduction of leukotrienes caused by aspirin/NSAIDs is suggested in the pathogenesis of aspirin hypersensitivity, the exact
mechanisms of AIAU and AICU are not understood. Mast cell
activation is involved in this mechanism since tryptase levels
are significantly elevated in sera and anti-histamines are considered a drug of choice for urticaria patients. Successful results
of anti-IgE therapy in severe urticaria patients are other evidence
of the involvement of mast cell in urticaria pathophysiology (2,
3) as well as atopy is a predisposing factor for both AIAU and
AICU (4).

There is solid evidences that patients suffering from urticaria
have been reported to frequently associate with autoimmune
disease (5-7), and the prevalence of thyroid auto-antibodies such

of TPO in effector cells. The prevalences of serum specific IgE to TPO were significantly
higher in AIAU (15.2%) and AICU groups (7.5%) compared to NC (0%, P= 0.018:
P=0.013, respectively). Flow cytometry showed CD203¢ induction in a dose dependent
manner with serial additions of TPO in some AIAU and AICU patients having high specific
IgE to TPO. Our findings show that the prevalence of serum specific IgE to TPO was
significantly higher in both AIAU and AICU patients than in NC. It is suggested that specific
IgE to TPO play a pathogenic role in AIAU and AICU.

as IgG to thyroid peroxidase (TPO) have been detected in 12%29% of urticaria patients (8). Patients with coexistent thyroid
autoimmunity and chronic urticaria have an even more severe
and prolonged course of urticaria than those without thyroid
autoimmunity (9). However so far, all studies have been evaluated for IgG to thyroid autoantibodies in chronic urticaria.

A recent study demonstrated the presence of highly cytokinergic IgE antibodies with polyreactivity to autoantigens including TPO in sera of atopic dermatitis patients, which could induce
mast cell activation (10), and Altrichter et al. (11) reported that
some of chronic spontaneous urticaria patients expressed IgE
antibodies against TPO as a novel pathomechanism of chronic
urticaria. However, they could not confirm whether these antibodies directly activate effector cells in chronic urticaria.

In this study, we hypothesized that specific IgE response to
TPO may involve mast cell activation in AIAU and AICU and detected serum specific IgE to TPO with a basophil activation test.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Patients

We recruited 59 AIAU patients, 96 AICU patients and 69 normal
controls (NC). The diagnosis of aspirin intolerance was confirmed based on clear clinical histories of recurrent urticaria after
aspirin/NSAIDs ingestions or positive results of oral challenge
test to aspirin. Chronic urticaria was defined as daily urticaria

that lasted more than 6 weeks. Urticaria severity in this study
was determined by urticarial activity score (UAS) system which
combines pruritus and four characteristics of wheals, including
number, duration, distribution range, and mean diameter in
total score range, 0-15. UAS score more than 13 is considered as
a severe urticaria in this system (12).

Detection of serum specific IgE and IgG to TPO

Serum specific IgE to TPO was measured by our manual direct
ELISA system. Briefly, dissolved commercial recombinant TPO
(RayBiotech, Norcross, GA) in 0.1 M of carbonate buffer was
coated at 96 well micro plate (Corning, New York, USA) for 12
hr at room temperature and then, each well was blocked with
10% FCS in PBS for two hours. After blocking, micro plates were
incubated with 1:2 diluted serum for two hours at room temperature, followed by biotinylated human anti-IgE antibody (diluted 1:1,000 in 10% FBS in PBS, Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA)
for one hour, and streptavidine-HRP (diluted 1:5,000) for thirty
minutes. Finally, the enzymatic dye reaction was stopped with
2.N H,SO, solution and the optical density was measured at 450
nm. Between each step intensive washings with 0.05% Tween
20 in PBS were performed more than three times. In this method, the cut-off value for serum specific IgE to TPO level was defined as mean and three times standard deviation of absorbance
values from 69 healthy controls. This definition was commonly
used in manual ELISA which has no standard sample (13). Serum IgG to TPO was measured by radioimmunoassay (BRAHMS
Aktiengesellschaft, Hennigsdorf, Germany).

CD203c expression on basophil by flow cytometry

Peripheral blood basophils were obtained from three subjects
with high levels of serum specific IgE to TPO and one healthy
controls (NC). Basophil activation tests with the additions of
TPO were then performed to prove a direct role of specific IgE
to TPO on effector cells of urticaria as previously described (14).
Briefly, whole blood was collected in ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes and red blood cells (RBCs) were lysed
with RBC lysis buffer (0.154 M NH.Cl, 10 mM KHCOs, 0.1 mM
EDTA, pH 7.2-7.4), and then aliquots of 50 WL of each stimulator were added to 100 uL of the leukocyte suspension. Stimulators included calcium ionophore A2319 (3 uM; Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA), anti-human goat IgE antibodies (1:100 vol/
vol; KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), and anti-IgG4 (1 and 10 pg/
mL; Sigma-Aldrich), and different concentration of TPO antigens
(0, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 g/mL). After stimulation, basophil CD203c
expression was measured by flow cytometry. After washing with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the resuspended cells were
stained with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated antihuman CD203c
(Beckman Coulter, Marseille, France), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antihuman CD123 (BD PharMingen,
San Jose, CA, USA), and allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti

human human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR (BD PharMingen),
or isotype-matched controls on ice in the dark for 30 min. After
washing once with PBS, the cells were analyzed on a FACS Canto II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA). The
cells were gated initially based on the dot plot defined by the
forward and side scatter, and then a second gate of high FITCCD123+ cells and low APC-HLA-DR was defined to select the
basophil population, analyzing at least 500 basophils. The percent CD203c expression was defined as the percentage of basophils expressing more CD203c than the critical point located at
10° < x < 10‘ in the histogram, which was about 10% of the basophils incubated with buffer only in the NC (19).

Statistical analysis

Data was presented by descriptive analysis. A Mann-Whitney
U-test were used to compare the clinical characteristics of chronic urticaria, including the positive rate of atopy, UAS, total IgE
and serum specific IgE to TPO level. Pearson’s Chi-square tested the differences between AIAU and AICU groups. Differences
were regarded as statistically significant for P < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows (SPSS 12.0,
Chicago, IL, USA).

Ethics statement

This study was approved by the ethics committee of Ajou University Hospital (IRB No. GEN-09-140) and done in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsink. Written informed consent was
obtained from each subject, and confirmed by the IRB.

RESULTS

Clinical and laboratory characteristics of the study
population

The clinical and laboratory characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table 1. There were no significant differences in age, gender, atopic status, and association with angioedema between AIAU and AICU groups except disease duration, and total IgE and eosinophilic cationic protein levels in
serum were not significant differences between AIAU and AICU

groups.

The prevalence of serum specific IgE to TPO in AIAU and
AICU patients

Levels of serum specific IgE to TPO were assessed by direct ELISA. The absolute values of serum specific IgE to TPO were 0.218
+ 0.446 in ATAU, 0.157 + 0.344 in AICU and 0.111 + 0.050 in NC.
These have a tendency to be increased in AIAU and AICU compared to NC with no significant difference. However, the prevalence of serum specific IgE to TPO above the cutoff were significantly higher in AIAU (15.2%) and AICU (7.3%) groups compared to NCs (0%, P = 0.018 ; P = 0.013, respectively) (Fig. 1).

in patients with IgE to TPO compared to the other group (723.562

The level of CD203c expression on basophil after TPO
stimulation

Next, we selected the basophil donors from patients who have
high levels of serum specific IgE to TPO and NC, and a basophil
activation test was done to show a direct role of specific IgE to
TPO on effector cells of urticaria. The result showed that the expression of activation marker, CD203c, increased remarkably in
dose dependent manners in representative two AICU and one
AIAU patients with the addition of TPO compared to NC (Fig. 2).

DISCUSSION

Mast cell activation has been known to play a key role in urticarial reaction, and many studies investigated the association

between autoimmune disease and this mast cell activation (1517). However, majority of them were about to IgG autoantibodies not IgE autoantibodies in urticaria. In fact, IgG autoantibodies is one of the mechanism to activate effector cells such as mast
cell or basophil in urticaria with binding to FceRI or IgE antibodies, but these reactions were different from well-known allergic reaction between allergens, IgE antibodies, and IgE receptors on mast cell or basophil.

In 2002, Sabroe et al. (18) reported different kind of autoantibodies in autoimmune urticaria which consisted of histaminereleasing anti-FceRI autoantibodies, anti-FceRI autoantibodies
without histamine-releasing activity, and anti-IgE like autoantibodies, but they couldn’t identify almost half of autoantibodies.
This finding means that another kind of autoantibodies other
than IgG may play a role in urticaria. Autologous serum skin
test is the only available in vivo test to detect histamine releasing autoimmune status with a prevalence of 42% to 68% in urticaria patients (15-18); however, it is impossible to characterize
the kind of autoantibodies in CSU patients through ASST.

Recently, Altrichter et al. (11) found that 54% of CSU patients
had a higher serum specific IgE to TPO with their site-directed
ELISA method. They concluded that subgroup of CSU patients
expresses IgE antibodies against TPO, and these autoantibodies could be auto-allergic pathomechanism in CSU. However,
they could not show direct activation of effector cells to these
autoantibodies. In this study, we confirmed the presence of circulating serum specific IgE to TPO using our manual direct ELISA in both AIAU and AICU patients in line with previous study,
and the most important part of this paper is to prove the direct

role of serum specific IgE to TPO in effector cell with basophil
activation test for the first time. The expression of CD203c on
basophils is well-known activation marker and can be used as a
potential marker of severe urticaria. The mean basophil CD203c
expression was significantly higher in severe urticaria patients
than in non-severe urticaria and NC (19).

However, there was quite big difference in the prevalence of
serum specific IgE to TPO between previous and our results (11).
This difference might be caused by ELISA method to detect TPO
specific IgE. We used direct ELISA method instead of site directed IgE capture ELISA which was used in previous study. Direct
ELISA is more specific method to detect serum specific IgE to
TPO, although sensitivity is lower compared to other method.
Further study will be needed to compare the sensitivity and specificity of both methods in detecting IgE to TPO.

Another finding of our study is significant high level of total
gE in presence of IgE to TPO compared to the absence of IgE to
TPO in aspirin intolerant urticaria patients. Total IgE is relatively non-specific marker in various allergic diseases, but recent
study found that it could be a potential marker for urticarial severity (20). Whereas 93% of patients with increased level of total
gE suffered from moderate-to-severe chronic urticaria, this was
observed in only 69% of patients with normal IgE. Especially,
patients with higher level of IgE had significant higher percentage of anti-thyroid antibodies compared to patients with normal level of IgE (31% vs. 7%, P < 0.001), although these antibodies were all IgG against thyroglobulin and thyroid microsomal
antigens (20, 21). Total IgE is not attributed to a specific trigger,
but the result of the B cell polyclonal activation. The elevated
expression of CD40L and Bcl-2 proved polyclonal activation of
both B and T cell in CU (22). Further study may clarify the effect
of this polyclonal activation on production of IgE to thyroid antigen such as TPO.

We also found relatively high prevalence of serum specific
IgG and IgE to TPO in AIAU patients compared to AICU patients.
Actually, there is no significant difference between levels of TPOspecific IgE in patients with AICU and aspirin tolerant chronic
urticaria in previous our study (unpublished data). The reason
to choose only aspirin intolerant urticaria was to evaluate the
difference between AIAU and AICU. You can see some difference (15.2% vs. 7.3%) of TPO specific IgE level as shown in Fig.
1, although statistical significance was not noted. Viral infections such as hepatitis C virus are known triggers for acute urticaria that can induce serum TPO formation. HCV antibodies
were found in 11.6% of the patients with autoimmune thyroid
diseases and 38.4% of them had circulating TPO antibodies
(23). Further studies are required to investigate possible interactions between autoantibody and viral infections in association with aspirin/NSAID exposure that induces mast cell activation in AIAU and AICU.

In this study, we found that the prevalence of serum specific

IgE to TPO was significantly higher in both AIAU and AICU patients than in NC and that the presence of circulating serum specific IgE to TPO may contribute to mast cell activation in AIAU
and AICU.
