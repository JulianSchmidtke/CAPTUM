ABSTRACT

Chronic urticaria (CU) associated with aspirin sensitivity, termed aspirin-intolerant CU (AICU), is a common condition in
the general population. The genetic mechanism of AICU still is not fully understood. We investigated genetic polymorphisms
of FceR1B and FceR1y in patients with CU including AICU and aspirin-tolerant CU (ATCU) by analyzing the genotypes and
haplotypes of four subsets of FceR1 genes in association with various clinical parameters. Four polymorphisms of FceR1
(FceR1B -109T>C, FceR1B E237G, FceR1y -237A>G, and FceR1y -54G>T) were genotyped in 119 AICU patients and
compared with 154 patients with ATCU and 224 normal healthy controls (NCs). No significant differences were observed with
respect to the allele and genotype frequencies of all four FceR1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; p > 0.05) in CU
including AICU and ATCU patients. However, two SNPs at FceR1B E237G and FceR1y —237A>G were associated with
atopy in AICU patients but not in ATCU. AICU patients with the AG/GG genotype of FceR1B E237G and FceR1y -237G
allele had a significantly higher frequency of atopy than those with the AA genotype (p = 0.02 and p = 0.040), respectively.
The release of histamine from basophils induced by anti-IgE antibodies was significantly higher in AICU patients than in NCs
and was increased in atopic patients compared with nonatopic patients (p = 0.006 and p = 0.007, respectively). The FceR1B
E237G and FceR1y-237T>G polymorphisms may be associated with the rate of atopy, which in turn could increase the release
of histamine from basophils and may lead to the development of the AICU phenotype.

hronic urticaria (CU), which is defined as the daily
occurrence of wheals for at least 6 weeks, is a
common allergic disease in the general population.
However, the pathogenic mechanisms of CU are not
fully understood, although mast cell activation and the
release of histamine are thought to play a key role.!?
The prevalence of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)-intolerant CU (AICU) is 0.2% in the general population,’
although it has been reported that aspirin and other
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) aggravate 20-30% of patients with CU.*° However,
within the Korean population, aspirin hypersensitivity
(confirmed by an oral provocation test) was noted in
35.7% of patients with CU. These patients presented
with a higher rate of atopy and total serum IgE level
than patients with aspirin-tolerant CU (ATCU),'” indicating that atopy may be a risk factor for AICU patients. Another study observed that anti-IgE-mediated

release of histamine from basophils was higher than
normal, which could contribute to CU development.”
Blanca eft al. (1989) found that AICU may be caused by
an IgE-mediated response.

The high-affinity IgE receptor (FceR1) is expressed
on the surface of mast cells and basophils and initiates
an IgE-mediated allergic response by activating mast
cells, which in turn release inflammatory mediators
such as histamine and proinflammatory cytokines. The
IgE receptor is a tetramer composed of a ligand-binding a-chain, a signal augmenting B-chain, and a signal
transducing y-chain dimer.*~'° In an association with
the a-chain, the B-chain of FceR1 is an amplifier for cell
surface expression. It also acts as an enhancer for signal
transduction via an immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif in the FceR1y chain.'' Among genetic variations of the FceR1 gene, the B-chain shows more
considerable variation than a- and y-chains. Although
FceR18 gene polymorphisms are associated with

only one report was found regarding about FceRly
gene polymorphism.'°

The FceRla gene was identified as the first IgEbinding site to induce mast cell activation. This initiates
receptor stabilization, which is critical to the IgE-mediated allergic response. '” We previously reported a
significant association with FceRla promoter polymorphisms and AICU.' However, at this time, no published data support any association with CU in terms
of FeeR1B and FceR1y polymorphisms. In this study,
we examined whether genetic polymorphisms of
FceR1B and FceR1y play an important role in CU and
analyzed the genotypes and haplotypes of four subsets
of FceR1 genes (FceR1B -109T>C [rs 1441586], FceR1B
E237G [rs 569108], FeeR1y -237A>G [rs 11587213], and
FceeR1y -54G>T [rs 2070901]) in association with various clinical parameters.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study Subjects

CU patients (n = 273) who had been suffering from
daily itchy wheals for >6 weeks with no known cause
of CU such as food allergy, urticarial vasculitis, physical urticaria, infectious agents, parasites, or autoimmune disease were recruited from Ajou University
Hospital, Suwon, Korea. The CU patients were classified into 119 patients with AICU and 154 patients with
ATCU according to the results of oral provocation with
500 mg of aspirin (Rhonal; KunWha Pharmaceutical
Co., Seoul, Korea) as described previously.’ AICU patients who had aspirin-induced asthma were excluded.
Normal healthy controls (NCs; 1 = 224) with no personal or family history of allergic diseases or aspirin or
drug hypersensitivity were recruited from the general
Korean population. Informed consent was obtained
from all subjects, and the Institutional Review Board of
Ajou University Hospital approved the study. Skinprick tests were performed with 55 common aeroaller
Allergy and Asthma Proceedings

gens (Bencard Co., West Sussex, United Kingdom), and
atopy was defined as one or more positive reactions to
common inhalant allergens. Total IgE concentrations
were measured using the UniCAP system (Pharmacia
Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Antithyroglobulin and
antimicrosomal antibodies in serum were detected
using anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase radioimmunoassays (B.R.A.H.M.S Aktiengesellschaft, Hennigsdorf, Germany), respectively. Serum antinuclear antibodies were detected by direct
immunofluorescence (Fluoro HEPANA test; Medical
and Biologic Laboratories Co., Ltd., Nagoya, Japan).

Genotyping

The genotyping of single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) FceR1B -109T>C and FceR1B E237G were described previously for a Korean population.”® SNPs in
the promoter region of FceRly were screened by
SNP-IT assays (Orchid Biosciences, Princeton, NJ). Information regarding SNPs in the promoter region of
FceR1ly was obtained from the National Center for
Biotechnology Information SNP database (www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/SNP). We selected four target SNPs by
direct sequencing. SNP genotyping was performed using SNP-IT assays with the SNPstream 25K system
(Orchid Biosciences). The region of genomic DNA
spanning the polymorphic site was amplified using
polymerase chain reaction with one phosphothiolated
primer and one regular polymerase chain reaction
primer. The sequences of the amplifying and extension
primers for FceR1B -109T>C, FceR1B E237G, FceR1y
-237A>G, and FceR1y -54G>T are shown (Table 1).

Histamine Release from Basophils

Histamine release from patients’ peripheral blood
leukocytes was examined according to a previously
reported method.! Briefly, 20 mL of blood was mixed

with 2.5 mL of 6% dextran (in 3% dextrose) and 1 mL
of EDTA. Samples were allowed to sediment at room
temperature for 2 hours. The plasma fraction was isolated from leukocytes by centrifugation at 250 x g for
8 minutes. The leukocyte pellet was washed twice with
PIPES solution A (25 mmol/L of piperazine-N-N-bis-2
ethane sulfonic acid, 110 mmol/L of sodium chloride,
5 mmol/L of potassium chloride, 40 mmol/L of sodium hydroxide, and 0.03% human serum albumin;
pH adjusted to 7.4) before being resuspended in PIPES
solution B (91 mmol/L of calcium chloride, 0.5
mmol/L of magnesium chloride, and 0.1% dextrose in
PIPES to a final concentration of 5 X 10° cells/ mL).

Calcium ionophore A2319 (3 uM; Sigma, Seoul,
South Korea) was used as a positive control. Antihuman goat IgE antibody used at the optimal concentration (1:100 v/v; KPL, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) was
added to 200 uL of leukocyte suspension and then
incubated for 15 minutes at 37°C. The suspensions
were centrifuged at 250 x g for 15 minutes at 4°C. The
supernatants were then collected and stored at 20°C
until they were assayed for histamine. All experiments
were performed in duplicate. Histamine concentration
(nM) was measured using the Histamine EIA kit (Immunotech, Marseille, France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The plate was read at a wavelength of 405 nM on a Synergic HT (Bio-Tek, DI
Biotech, Ltd. Seoul, South Korea).

Statistical Analysis

Significant departures of genotype frequency from
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at each polymorphic site
were tested using chi-squared analyses. Haplotypes of
the FceR1 gene were analyzed using Haploview Version 2.0 based on the expectation maximization algorithm.'? Pairwise linkage disequilibrium between SNP
loci was measured using the absolute value of Lewontin’s D’ and r.”° Differences in the mean values of
phenotypic characteristics among AICU patients were
compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and
t-tests. Differences in histamine release between two
different genotype groups were examined using a
Mann-Whitney U-test. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 11.5 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago,
IL) with a significance level of p < 0.05.

RESULTS

Clinical Characteristics of the Study Subjects

The mean age of the ATCU group (39.33 + 11.74)
was significantly higher than that of AICU patients
(35.19 + 11.55; p < 0.004) and the NCs (35.83 + 15.04;
(p < 0.012). The AICU (74.6%) and ATCU (48.4%)
patients exhibited a significantly higher rate of atopy
than the NCs (14.7%; p < 0.001) and AICU patients

252

exhibited a significantly higher rate of atopy than the
ATCU patients (p < 0.001).

AICU (2.26 + 0.47) patients also had higher serum
total IgE levels than the ATCU (2.05 + 0.48) and NC
(1.70 + 0.59) groups (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). Both CU groups had a significantly higher rate
of atopy (CU versus NC; 59.8% versus 14.7%) and more
antinuclear antibodies than NCs (CU versus NC; 18%
versus 2.6%; p < 0.001; Table 2).

Allele Genotype Frequencies of the FceR1 Gene
with the CU, AICU, and ATCU Phenotypes

Genetic associations were examined between the
four genetic polymorphisms of FceR1B -109T>C,
FceR1B E237G, FceR1y—-237A>G, and FceR1y-54G>T
and the three study groups (AICU, ATCU, and NC).
No significant differences were observed with respect
to the allele and genotype frequencies of FceR1B
-109T>C, FceR1B E237G, FceRly -237A>G, and
FceR1y-54G>T (p > 0.05) in CU as well as in AICU or
ATCU groups when using either alternative models,
codominant, dominant, or recessive models (Table 3).
Haplotypes were constructed for FceR1f8 and FceR1y
using the expectation maximization algorithm. No significant differences were observed in haplotype frequencies between AICU versus NC and ATCU versus
NC as well as AICU versus ATCU (p > 0.05 for all
comparisons; data not shown).

Analysis of FceR1 Polymorphisms with Clinical
Parameters

Analysis of the FceR18 E237G genetic polymorphism
showed that CU patients with the FceR1f —237G allele
had a higher rate of atopy. Specifically, AICU patients
carrying the AG/GG genotype had a significantly
higher frequency of atopy than patients with the homozygous AA genotype (p = 0.021). Similarly, ATCU
patients carrying the homozygous TT genotype had a
significantly higher level of antimicrosomal antibodies
than patients with the CT/CC genotype in FceR1B
-109T>C genetic polymorphism (p = 0.02). AICU patients carrying the FceR1ly —237G allele had a higher
rate of atopy than those carrying the homozygous AA
genotype (p = 0.040; Table 4). In contrast, no such
associations were found between atopy and genetic
polymorphisms of FceR1B E237G and FceRly
-237A>G in ATCU patients (Table 5). Furthermore, no
associations were found between FceR1B -109T>C
and FceRly -54G>T genetic polymorphisms with
atopy status in both AICU and ATCU patients and no
associations were observed regarding the other clinical
parameters with four genetic polymorphisms.

Histamine Release from Peripheral Basophils
Obtained from AICU Patients and NCs

We evaluated the histamine release from peripheral
blood basophils in patients with AICU by using antiIgE antibodies. The IgE-mediated histamine content in
patients with AICU was higher than in the NC (p =
0.006; Fig. 1 a). Among the AICU patients, atopic individuals showed significantly higher histamine content
than nonatopic individuals (p = 0.007; Fig. 1 b).

DISCUSSION

We investigated four genetic polymorphisms of
FceR1B and FceR1y for associations with CU and compared their association with AICU and ATCU in a
Korean population. This is the first study to screen and
investigate the SNPs FceRly -237T>G and FceRly
-54G>T in CU patients. No significant differences
were found in allele and genotype frequencies of the
SNPs and their haplotypes between the study groups,
suggesting that these gene polymorphisms may not be
related to the AICU and ATCU phenotypes in this
Korean population.

Previous studies suggested that AICU patients had a
significantly higher rate of atopy than ATCU patients
and NCs, suggesting that atopy may be a risk factor for
AICU.°?! Furthermore, the prevalence of atopy was
significantly higher in challenge-proven NSAID-intolerant patients.” In this study, we also found a significantly higher rate of atopy in AICU patients than in
ATCU patients and NCs. Specifically, AICU patients
with the AG/GG genotype of the FceR1f E237G polymorphism had a significantly higher rate of atopy than
those with the AA genotype in a Korean population, as
shown in previous studies.**** Patients carrying the
FceR1y —237G allele also had the highest rate of atopy.
In contrast, these associations were not observed in the
case of ATCU. Furthermore, we found that AICU patients produced higher histamine content than NCs,
and atopic AICU patients also produced significantly
higher histamine content in response to anti-IgE antibodies than nonatopic patients. Even though we could
not get the direct association between histamine content according to genetic polymorphism, our findings
regarding the association between atopy and histamine
content can not be precluded. Two patients were excluded for the analysis of histamine content of atopy
versus nonatopic AICU because skin-prick tests could
not be performed in those patients. Taken together,
these two results suggest that the FceRly -237T>G
and FceR1B E237G polymorphisms may be associated
with atopic status, which may increase the release of
histamine from basophils and lead to development of
the AICU phenotype.

Previous studies showed a significant association of
FceR1B -109T>C and FceR1g E237G***’ polymor

phisms with serum IgE levels in asthmatic patients. In
AICU patients, significant differences were noted in
serum total IgE levels according to the FceRla
-344C>T polymorphisms. The number of patients
with the T allele was significantly higher in the AICU
group than in the ATCU group, and they were found
to have a high serum total IgE level.’° In this study,
although there were no significant differences in serum
total IgE level according to four genetic polymorphisms (FceR1B -109T>C, FceR1B E237G, FceRly
-237T>G, and FeeR1y -54G>T), serum total IgE was
significantly higher in the AICU patients than in the
ATCU and NC groups. Several reports have suggested
that the level of circulating IgE may be related to the
expression of the high-affinity IgE receptor on mast
cells and basophils, because increased expression
might promote mast cell survival and increase the
release of histamine.??*°

Several studies have reported evidence suggesting
hat CU is associated with thyroid autoimmunity.>!**
One study indicated that 35-45% of CU patients have
clinically relevant functional thyroid autoantibodies in
he FceR1 on basophils and mast cells.*? The products
derived from the activated immune system can lower
he cutaneous mast cell release threshold, possibly alowing activation by endogenous compounds and
hence release of mediators of recurrent urticaria. In our
study, the CU patients had high serum antithyroglobuin (15.9%) and antimicrosomal (12.6%) antibodies, but
no significant differences were noted between AICU
and ATCU patients. However, among ATCU patients,
subjects carrying the TT genotype had a significantly
higher level of antimicrosomal antibodies than patients

with the CT/CC genotypes at FceR1B -109T>C,
whereas among AICU patients, subjects carrying the
homozygous GG genotype at FceRly -54G>T polymorphism tended to have a higher level of antithyroglobulin antibody than patients with the GT/TT genotype. Additional studies will be needed to investigate
how these associations contribute to the intermediate
phenotype of CU.

In conclusion, we analyzed two sets of FceR1B and
FceR1y genetic polymorphisms in CU patients, comparing those with AICU and ATCU. Given our data,
we suggest that there was no association between
FceR1B -109T>C, FeeR1B E237G, FceR1ly -237T>G,
and FceRly -54G>T gene polymorphisms and their
genotypes and haplotypes with the CU, AICU, and
ATCU phenotype in a Korean population. However,
two SNPs of FceR1 (FceR1B E237G and FceR1ly
—237T>G) may increase atopy, which could contribute
to the development of the AICU phenotype by increasing histamine release from basophils.
