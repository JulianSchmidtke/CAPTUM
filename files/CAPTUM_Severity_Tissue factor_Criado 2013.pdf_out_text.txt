Abstract: BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated that neutrophils, eosinophils and monocytes, under appropriated stimulus, may express tissue factor and therefore, activate the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. We performed a transversal and case-control study of patients with chronic urticaria and patients with psoriasis, in our
outpatient clinic to evaluate the production of D-dimer. OpjEcTIVE: To evaluate D-dimer serum levels in patients
with chronic urticaria and its possible correlation with disease activity. PATIENTS AND METHODs: The study was
conducted from October 2010 until March 2011. We selected 37 consecutive patients from our Allergy Unit and
Psoriasis Unit, and divided them into three groups for statistical analysis: (i) 12 patients with active chronic
urticaria (CU); (ii) 10 patients with chronic urticaria under remission and (iii) 15 patients with psoriasis (a disease
with skin inflammatory infiltrate constituted by neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes). Another five patients
with urticarial vasculitis were allocated in our study, but not included in statistical analysis. The serum levels of
D-dimer were measured by Enzyme Linked Fluorescent Assay (ELFA), and the result units were given in ng/ml
FEU. REsuLts: Patients with active chronic urticaria had the highest serum levels of D-dimer (p<0.01), when compared to patients with CU under remission and the control group (patients with psoriasis). CONCLUSIONS: Patients
with active chronic urticaria have higher serum levels of D-dimer, when compared to patients with chronic
urticaria under remission and patients with psoriasis. We found elevated serum levels of D-dimer among
patients with urticarial vasculitis.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic urticaria (CU) has a wide spectrum of
clinical presentations and possible etiologies."* The
pathogenesis of CU includes immunological and nonimmunological types and an idiopathic type.
Moreover, it has been recently associated with the
presence of histamine-releasing IgG autoantibodies,
found in 50% of cases previously considered of
unknown cause, which characterizes the autoimmune
urticaria.* Urticaria is caused by degranulation of
cutaneous mast cells and/or basophils. Degranulation
releases potent vasoactive mediators that induce
vasodilatation and increased capillary permeability,
resulting in erythema and wheal formation. Itching
and pain are caused by sensory nerve stimulation. The
main vasoactive mediator is histamine, but there are
other inflammatory mediators such as arachidonic
acid metabolites, leukotrienes (LTC4, D4 and E4),
prostaglandin D2, serotonin, acetylcholine, platelet
activating factor, heparin, codeine, anaphylatoxins C3,
C5a, quinones and neurotransmitters released from
cutaneous nerve endings.’ Degranulation is related to
immunological causes (IgE, immune complexes, complement dependent), non-immunological causes
(pseudoallergic, infectious or due to direct action of
agents released by mast cells) and idiopathic. One of
the most important factors that induce degranulation
of mast cells in chronic urticaria is the presence of histamine IgG releasing autoantibodies against a-subunit
IgE high affinity receptor (FceRIa) or against IgE,
which has been demonstrated in 50% of patients with
chronic idiopathic urticaria.°”

Recent reports revealed that patients with CU
show signs of thrombin generation and activation of
the tissue factor pathway of the coagulation cascade.*
D-dimer (DD) is a fibrin degradation product formed
during the lysis of a thrombus. DD elevations are
detected in plasma during the onset of thrombus formation and its elevation usually lasts about a week.
For this reason, it is possible to find high levels of DD
during increased fibrinolytic activity. It occurs in high
concentrations in many clinical conditions, such as
deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. It
may be also be elevated in myocardial infarction, disseminated intravascular coagulation, pneumonia,
heart failure, neoplasia, polytrauma or in patients
undergoing surgery. Currently, elevated DD has also
been associated with severity and activity of chronic
urticaria.””” The normal serum level of DD is less than
500 micrograms/litre. The serum levels of D-dimer
were measured by Enzyme Linked Fluorescent Assay
(ELFA), and the result units were given in ng/mL FEU
- fibrinogen equivalent unit. A positive value was
over 200 ng/mL FEU, with a negative result when the
final value was less than that.

 

An Bras Dermatol. 2013;88(3):355-60.

There are few reports about the relationship
between DD levels and chronic urticaria and its role in
this disease, which led us to make this work.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

The study population comprised patients with
chronic urticaria (more than 6 weeks of disease),
attending our outpatient clinic (Allergy Unit) from
October 2010 to March 2011. The inclusion criterion
was the clinical and histopathologic diagnosis of
chronic urticaria (CU) and exclusion criteria were the
diagnosis of other diseases that could alter the coagulation cascade, or the use of anticoagulant therapy.
The control population consisted of patients with psoriasis, from our outpatient clinic (Psoriasis Unit).

The design of this research was descriptive and
transversal case-control. The first and second groups
of patients with chronic urticaria that underwent ddimer levels measurements were classified as: active
(symptomatic) CU (12 patients) and CU under remission (10 patients). Fifteen volunteers with psoriasis
constituted the third group.

The active CU group was defined as patients
showing the presence of active cutaneous lesions as
urticarial plaques, using hydroxyzyne and loratadine.
This group consisted of 12 patients, ten females and
two males, with ages ranging from 24 to 69 years old,
(mean age 37.5 years).

There were 10 patients in the CU group in
remission (seven females and three males; aged
between 28-49 years old, with mean age of 39.3 years).
For remission criteria we established that the patients
must have been without urticaria or angioedema
lesions for a minimum period of 30 days and under
treatment with antihistamines (hydroxyzine plus
loratadine).

The control group was composed of 15 patients
with psoriasis (seven females and eight males; range
28-53 years-old, mean age 42.4 years).

Five patients with chronic, active lesions resembling urticaria, with histopathologic findings that further revealed leukocytoclastic vasculitis, indicating
the diagnosis of urticarial vasculitis, were also included as a separate group. We evaluated D-dimer serum
levels in this group of patients. However we did not
include these patients in the statistical analysis due to
the small number of cases.

The serum levels of D-dimer were measured by
Enzyme Linked Fluorescent Assay (ELFA), and the
result was given in ng/mL FEU (fibrinogen equivalent unit).

potential differences in D-dimer levels between
patients with active CU, compared with CU patients
under remission and controls (patients with psoriasis)
were calculated by application of Pearson’s Chisquared test.

RESULTS

All demographic data and D-dimer levels of the
patients allocated in the study are described in table 1.

Elevated serum levels of D-dimer were found
in 12 out of 22 patients with chronic the active
urticaria (54.5%). The average D-dimer level was 869
ng/mL FEU; with the normal level being less than 500
ng/mL FEU. The remaining 10 patients with chronic
urticaria under remission (45.5%) presented normal
levels of DD (average 339 ng/mL FEU). In the control
group (patients with psoriasis), only one patient
exceeded the normal levels of the D-dimer, the others
had normal levels with an average of 337 ng/mL FEU
(Table 2).

After applying the tests of mean differences
between patients with chronic urticaria with activity
and under remission, the difference between the two
groups was significant (p<0.01). Also, we calculated the
odds ratio (OR) and it revealed that patients with chronic urticaria have OR = 18.0, for elevated D-dimer levels,
compared with patients with psoriasis (Graph 1).

In three patients with urticarial vasculitis the
disease was idiopathic during the study. One patient
(case 4) had antiphospholipid antibodies and ANA
positive. The D-dimer levels were elevated in all 5
patients with urticarial vasculitis (Table 3).

 

DISCUSSION

Skin reactivity to the intradermal injection of
autologous serum (autologous serum skin test - ASST)
and/or plasma (autologous plasma skin test - APST)
has been proposed to identify chronic urticaria (CU)
patients with an autoimmune or auto reactive disease."

Immune-mediated inflammation and coagulation are strictly linked, and coagulation activation has
been described in CU patients as shown by the elevations of plasma prothrombin fragment F1+2 and Ddimer."

In CU, several investigators have demonstrated
that the activation of coagulation is due to the involvement of eosinophils and a tissue factor pathway, with
generation of thrombin potentially contributing to an
increased vascular permeability. CU patients often
present elevation of coagulation and fibrinolysis
markers, such as prothrombin fragment F1+2 and Ddimer, which correlate with the disease severity.”
Preliminary data indicate that anticoagulant treatment with heparin and warfarin may be effective in

reducing the symptoms of CU. All these findings provide the rationale for proposing clinical trials on the
use of anticoagulant drugs as adjuvant treatment in
CU patients.*

Asero et al. correlated the presence of intense
activity of the coagulation cascade with exacerbations
of lesions in patients with chronic urticaria." Recent
reports revealed that patients with CU show signs of
thrombin generation and activation of the tissue factor
pathway of the coagulation cascade and autologous
plasma skin tests score positive in as many as 95% of
cases.” Moreover, CU patients showing positive
response to ASST had plasma profile of the urokinase
system-associated proteins, which was not markedly

different as compared with CU patients with negative
ASST as well as healthy subjects, suggesting that systemic fibrinolysis may not be involved in chronic
urticaria.”

In our study we also observed increased serum
levels of D-dimer among patients with active CU and
patients with urticarial vasculitis in all patients.

Mast cells, essential elements involved in the
pathogenesis of CU, produce GM-CSF (granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor) and PAF
(platelet-activating factor).* These factors stimulate
resting eosinophils, inducing translocation of encrypted Tissue Factor (TF) to cytoplasmatic membrane,
which will activate blood coagulation system."

In CU, some authors have demonstrated that
generation of thrombin could potentially be contributing to an increased vascular permeability, because
thrombin may activate PAR-1 on endothelial cells,
amplifying the inflammatory response in urticaria’.
Mast cells express both PAR-1 and PAR-2. The thrombin generated may activate mast cells via PAR-1 and
the complexes TF+FVIIa and FVat+FXa may activate
these cells via PAR-2, amplifying the continuous activation of mast cells in CU." (Figure 1).

Our results are similar to those obtained by
Asero et al, in that the use of D-dimer levels in the
blood of patients with chronic urticaria could be a
potential serum marker to withdraw antihistamine
treatment, as there is a decrease in their values.” New
prospective studies that include serum D-dimer level
analysis in a larger number of patients with chronic
urticaria, before and during treatment, are needed to
accomplish this use.

To the best of our knowledge, the finding of elevated levels of d-dimer in the blood of patients with
urticarial vasculitis has not been reported in the literature. Currently, it is known that tissue factor can be
found encrypted (inactive) in the cytoplasm of various peripheral blood cell elements, such as monocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils and platelets.'*

Ficure 1: Proposition of events involving the coagulation cascade in chronic urticaria: During activation of mast cells occurs the release of
vasoactive amines (mainly histamine), eicosanoids, and cytokines. Histamine H1 receptors act on endothelial cells promoting vasodilatation
and increasing capillary permeability. GM-CSF (Granulocyte/ macrophage colony-stimulating factor) and PAF (platelet activating factor) are
able to activate eosinophils in the dermis and promote the expression of tissue factor (TF) in their cytoplasm membrane. Activated eosinophils secrete major basic protein (MBP) that stimulates mast cells. Besides these events, TF generated by eosinophils may start the extrinsic
pathway of coagulation forming the complex VIIa+TF, that together with complex Xa+Va, act in mast cells via protease activated receptor 2
(PAR2). Thrombin activates: (i) PAR 1 on endothelial cells leading to the secretion and expression of the mediators of inflammation and anticoagulants (ICAM-1, NO and others); (ii) PAR1 of mast cells inducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory (histamine, PAF, cytokines, and
others) and anti-inflammatory (heparin, NO) mediators. The fibrin is then degraded by fibrinolytic system in fibrin degradation products
(FDP), including d-dimer, which can be detected in peripheral blood. Abbreviations: PAR, protease activated receptor; ICAM, intercellular
adhesion molecule; NO, nitric oxide

The exposure of subendothelial TF to blood
after vessel injury is a critical step in hemostasis and

trophils, resulting in “nuclear dust”, which together
with edema of the dermis and fibrinoid necrosis of

in the pathogenesis of arterial and venous thrombotic
disorders. Moreover, there is an additional role for
overexpression of TF and subsequent generation of
TF: FVIIa complex, FXa and thrombin have recently
emerged as contributors in non-thrombotic manifestations such as inflammation, cancer growth and fibrosis.”

Urticarial vasculitis usually presents with a
considerable number of intact and degenerated neu
small diameter blood vessels of the superficial dermis
compose the typical histopathology pattern of this
disease." Recently some authors showed that the activated fraction of C5 complement, when bound to its
receptor on the membrane of neutrophils, activate
these cells and begin to express tissue factor in their
cytoplasm membranes. Moreover, C5a can induce
thrombosis by increasing TF expression on endothelial cells and monocytes in mice.”” Ritis et al. report

ed the same results in humans.” The expression of tissue factor may activate the extrinsic pathway of coagulation, generating thrombin and fibrin, which, under
fibrinolysis may produce D-dimer. Thus, this
sequence of events may explain our findings of elevated d-dimer in plasma of patients with urticarial vasculitis during disease activity.
