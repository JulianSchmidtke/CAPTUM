Chronic urticaria phenotypes:
clinical differences regarding triggers, activity,
prognosis and therapeutic response

Background: The subtypes of chronic urticaria (CU) share a common clinical expression, but phenotypically may show differences.
Objectives: To evaluate sociodemographic and clinical differences in
CU phenotypes, including: (1) isolated chronic spontaneous urticaria
(CSU); (2) isolated chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU); (3) CSU with
concomitant CIndU (CSU-CIndU); (4) CSU with single or multiple
episodes; (5) early and late-onset CSU (<45/65 years vs >45/65 years);
and (6) CSU with presence vs absence of serum autoreactivity. Materials and Methods: A retrospective observational study of 997 patients
with urticaria was performed, with clinical, laboratory and therapeutic
comparisons between CU subtypes. Results: A clear female predominance was detected for CU, mostly in patients with serum autoreactivity.
CIndU patients were younger, showed less angioedema, and had a better
response to antihistamines. Stress and drugs were the main triggering factors for CSU. Patients with exclusive CIndU or recurrent CSU
showed less psychiatric comorbidities. Patients with concomitant CIndU
and serum autoreactivity showed greater urticaria activity. Conclusion:
Knowledge of the clinical differences between CSU subtypes may help
to define an individual therapeutic strategy and improve the control of
symptoms and quality of life.

rticaria is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by the development of itchy wheals (hives),
angioedema or both. The classic definition postu
lates two subtypes of urticaria depending on the duration;

acute urticaria (AU) if the duration is <six weeks, and
chronic urticaria (CU) if the symptoms persist >six weeks

[1]. Children more commonly show AU than CU, whereas

CU is more frequent in adults. CU is estimated to affect

0.5-1% of the general population, with an annual inci
dence of 1.4% [2]. The current guidelines classify CU as

spontaneous (also called idiopathic) (chronic spontaneous
urticaria [CSU], with no specified eliciting factor involved)

or inducible (chronic inducible urticaria [CIndU], with a

specific eliciting factor involved) [1]. Both CU types can

occur concomitantly in the same patient.

CSU may exhibit autoimmune pathogenesis and in approx
imately half of the cases, active angioedema and a good

response to H;-antihistamines is reported [3-5]. On the
other hand, ClIndU is triggered by clearly identified

environmental factors, 80-90% of patients respond to H;
antihistamines, and, except for cases with pressure urticaria,

ClIndU is rarely associated with angioedema [6]. The CIndU

subtype that responds worst to Hj-antihistamines therapy

is delayed pressure urticaria.

Correct identification of the CU phenotypes and identifi
cation of biomarkers have become important elements for

urticaria, chronic inducible urticaria, serum autoreactivity, prognosis

predicting prognosis and helping clinicians to design a diagnostic and therapeutic plan [7].

Based on recent preliminary work from our group, we
identified multiple CSU episodes, late-onset >45 years (a
specific subgroup with onset >65 years old), concomitant
ClIndU [6], and functional serum autoreactivity as prognostic factors that can be used to characterise specific CSU
subtypes [8].

The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether
sociodemographic, clinical or laboratory parameters differ
between patients in these different categories with specific
phenotypic features.

Patients and methods

A retrospective, observational study based on review of
medical charts of an initial cohort of 1,056 patients
attending the Urticaria Unit of the Hospital del Mar (REGMAR 2000-2014) is presented. Data from 997 patients
aged more than 16 years with a diagnosis of urticaria
(AU, CSU or CIndU) were included in the statistical analysis. Clinical features, complementary tests, and
response to the treatment were assessed according to the
EAACI/GA7LEN/WAO/EDF guideline recommendations

[1] and were systematically documented on an electronic
case report form (www.adknoma.com/URTICARIA) (see
supplementary table 1).

The following subgroups were compared: (1) CSU vs
exclusive CIndU; (2) isolated CSU (isCSU) vs CSU with
concomitant CIndU (CSU-CIndU); (3) one episode vs
>one episode of CSU; (4) <45 years vs >45 years as initial
age for the first CSU episode; (5) <65 years vs >65 years
as initial age for the first CSU episode; and (6) presence vs
absence of serum autoreactivity. Serum autoreactivity was
tested using the Autologous Skin Serum Test (ASST) [9]
(figure 1).

The values of the Urticaria Activity Score refer only to the
baseline condition.

Laboratory parameters were considered to be altered (high
or low) when they were outside of the normal range.
Ethics Committee-Clinical Research from Hospital del Mar
granted ethical approval for this study (2013/5363/I) and
written informed consent was signed by, and obtained from,
all participants.

Statistical analysis

For all CSU variables, descriptive statistics are provided. Quantitative variables were described as means
and standard deviations (SD) and categorical variables
as absolute and relative frequencies, and were compared
between groups using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney
or Kruskal-Wallis tests, while categorical variables were
assessed using the Chi-Square or Fisher’s exact tests. All
data were analysed using the SAS® system version 9.4 for
Windows. The analyses were performed based on the available data, without imputation of missing values. Given the
exploratory nature of the study, « was set at a two-tailed p
value of 0.05 without correction for multiple comparisons.

Results

Differences between CSU and isolated CIndU

Exclusive CIndU was present in 248 patients including patients with symptomatic dermographism (31.0%)
and cold (28.2%), cholinergic (23.0%), delayed pressure
(11.3%), solar (9.3%), contact (4.8%), heat (1.2%), and
aquagenic urticaria (0.8%).

Table 1 shows the specific distinctive clinical features of
patients suffering with CSU or exclusive CIndU forms.
No differences were found among the subtypes of CIndU.
Specifically, 26.8% of patients with CSU were men, compared to 42.3% in the CIndU subgroup (p<0.0001). Patients
with CIndU were significantly younger than patients with
CSU (p<0.0001) and presented with a longer duration of
the disease (p=0.0317). CIndU patients presented less thyroid (p<0.0001) and psychiatric comorbidities (p=0.0176)
and suffered fewer exacerbations due to acetylsalicylic
acid (ASA) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) (p=0.0133 and p=0.0005, respectively) than
patients with isolated CSU. Angioedema was more common in this latter group (p=0.0003). For patients with CSU,
drugs (p<0.0001) and stress (p<0.0001) were the most

628

common triggers and exacerbating factors in contrast to
the CIndU group. In terms of laboratory findings, patients
with CSU presented with higher values of IgA antigliadin
(p=0.0168) and C-reactive protein (p=0.0180), and lower
values for blood basophils (p<0.0001). The mean total
IgE for CSU was only slightly lower than that for CIndU
patients (p=0.0458). Finally, based on evaluation of the
treatment, control with second-generation antihistamines
at licensed doses was achieved in only 49.4% of CSU
patients, compared with 65.9% of patients with CIndU
(p=0.0323).

Differences between isCSU and CSU-CIndU

Few differences were observed between patients with
isCSU (n=438) and those with concomitant CIndU (n=111).
The most common types of associated CIndU were symptomatic dermographism (74.7%) and delayed pressure
urticaria (33.2%), irrespective of whether CSU was concomitantly present with either. Patients with CSU-CIndU
showed a higher UAS3w (53.9 vs 33.5; p=0.0005) and more
atopy (p=0.0083) with slightly higher values for eosinophils
(p=0.0109) and total IgE (p=0.0278) and lower values
for thyroid diseases (p=0.0010) than patients with isCSU.
Stress was reported as the main trigger factor for isolated
CSU patients, in contrast to the group with concomitant
CIndU (p=0.0180) (table 2).

Differences between one vs >one CSU episode

There was no difference between the two groups with
regards to sociodemographic factors. Patients with CSU
tended to have at least one complete year without symptoms
and treatment. Patients with a unique CSU episode reported
more concomitant psychiatric diseases (p=0.0487). The
mean duration of CSU episodes was almost 16 months
longer (p<0.0001) than that for patients suffering with multiple CSU episodes. In addition, CIndU was reported in
21.9% of cases vs 13.3% in patients with >one episode of
CSU (p=0.0497) (table 2).

On the other hand, patients with >one episode reported
stress as the main trigger and an exacerbating factor in
contrast to patients with a single episode (p=0.0167 and
p=0.0194, respectively).

In terms of laboratory findings, we found significantly
higher levels of basophils (py<0.0001) and eosinophils
(p=0.0027) in patients with only one CSU episode. In addition, higher values for alkaline phosphatase (p=0.0384)
and total IgE (p=0.0155) and lower values for serum iron
(p=0.0264) were also reported. No differences in terms of
positivity for the ASST or treatment response were found
between groups.

Differences according to age at onset

The mean age (SD) at the beginning of the first episode
was 37.7 (8.6) years and 62.4 (10.9) years for patients
aged <45 years and >45 years, respectively. Patients aged
>45 years more frequently had a personal history of concomitant diseases (thyroid diseases, hypercholesterolaemia
and diabetes mellitus) than patients with a first episode at
<45 years. These younger patients more often presented
with associated CIndU (27.3% vs 14.7%) (p=0.0003). In

Figure 2. Distribution of patients by age at first CSU episode.

terms of laboratory findings, patients with a first episode
at >45 years presented with lower values for eosinophils
(p=0.0034) and total IgE (p<0.0001) and higher values for alkaline phosphatase (p<0.0001) and cholesterol
(p<0.0001) (table 2).

For patients with late-onset CSU (> sixty-five years), representing 21.7% of CSU patients in our series, blood
hypertension and diabetes were more frequently present
(p<0.0001), whereas atopy was less frequently observed
(21.6% vs 8.1%; p=0.0020). Drug intake appeared to be an
exacerbating factor in patients >65 years (p=0.0284) who
tended to show lower values for eosinophils (p=0.0014)
and total IgE (p=0.0054) and higher values for alkaline
phosphatase (p=0.0023) and cholesterol (p<0.0001). In
contrast, patients with onset of CSU at <65 years showed
a higher percentage of positive ASST (p=0.0257) (table 2).
The distribution of patients according to age at first episode
is presented in figure 2.

Differences between positive and negative
serum autoreactivity

Regarding the sociodemographic data, 80.4% of patients
with positive results were female (p=0.0015) (figure 3).
Patients with positive ASST showed a higher UAS7 and
UAS3w vs patients with negative ASST (22.9 vs 17.1,
p=0.0001 and 46.5 vs 29.6, p=0.0002, respectively). Drug
intake appeared to be an exacerbating factor, which was
more prevalent in patients with positive ASST (p=0.0350).
In terms of laboratory findings, patients with positive
ASST presented with lower values for alkaline phosphatase (p=0.0030), basophils (p<0.0001), eosinophils
(p=0.0031), total T3 (p=0.0012), and total IgE (p=0.0045)
(table 2).

The specific clinical variables differentially expressed
among the phenotypes are presented in figure 3.

Discussion

CU is a common and heterogeneous disease, in which the
identification of clinical features of different phenotypes

632 —

may be of outmost importance in order to predict the prognosis and the therapeutic behaviour of the disease [8, 10].
In this study, we have evaluated the clinical features
and sociodemographic and laboratory differences within
a group of possible CU phenotypes. Patients with isolated CIndU were younger than CSU patients, showing
a mean age of 44.08 + 15.86 vs 51.48 + 15.81, respectively [11-14]. A clear female predominance was observed
in all CSU phenotypes except for exclusive CIndU patients.
The female predilection for the prevalence of CSU has
been explained by the involvement of autoimmune mechanisms in about half of all CSU cases [11]. A lack of female
predominance in elderly patients with CSU has also been
reported, even though we have not observed this finding in
our patients [15-17].

CSU-associated comorbidities (i.e. autoimmune disorders
and psychiatric disorders) were not present in CIndU
patients [18-20]. Stress appears as an important trigger
and exacerbating factor for CSU patients; a group that
tends to present with greater exacerbation of urticaria
associated with intake of ASA and NSAIDs, relative to
ClIndU patients [21, 22]. In fact, exacerbation following
NSAIDs has been considered a distinct phenotype that
should be considered separately from exclusive CSU
[23]. The differences in terms of laboratory parameters
between CSU and CIndU clearly show autoimmunity as
a comorbidity associated with CSU. A significant increase
in C-reactive protein detected in CSU patients is related
to disease activity and the impact of, and response to,
treatment [24]. Interestingly, an episode of urticaria was
controlled using a first-line treatment (licensed doses of
second-generation H1-antihistamines) [1] in only half of
the CSU group, in contrast to 66% of the CIndU group.
Taken together, the data appear to suggest a difference in
clinical features and progression between CSU and CIndU
patients that may indicate a need for special consideration
of these phenotypes in the future regarding guidelines for
urticaria management.

A higher rate of atopy was observed in CSU-CIndU
patients, a previously reported association [25, 26]. In a
recent study, Altrichter et al. reported a close relationship
between patients with cholinergic urticaria and atopy with
more severe disease. However, the levels of IgE were high
both in atopic and non-atopic patients. In terms of activity,
CSU-CIndU patients suffered with more active forms of
urticaria according to baseline UAS3w results and a longer
duration of the disease [8], with less positive ASST results
(25, 27].

Regarding the course of the disease, when just one CSU
episode occurred, the episode was longer and patients
tended to present more frequently with concomitant CIndU
and psychiatric impact. When more than one episode
occurred, peaks of stress were most commonly involved
as the trigger. Patients with more than one episode showed
shorter episodes, but a longer disease duration over time.
In our series, severe patients with very active CSU for
the first time showed a longer mean duration for the first
episode, which may be related to disease management for
such phenotypes.

Patients suffering with more than one episode showed significantly more stressful life events both as a trigger and
exacerbating factor than patients with only one episode.
This is consistent with the comparison of CSU vs CIndU,
in which CSU patients showed stress as the main trigger

and exacerbating factor. Stressful life events clearly trigger
new episodes of CSU although the mechanism is unknown.
Patients with only one episode had higher alkaline phosphatase and eosinophils values, less sequestration of
basophils, lower values for iron serum, and higher total
IgE values. Increased vascular markers (D-Dimer) and
eosinophil levels [28], as well as a high level of responsiveness of basophils and IgE [29-31], have been previously
described in CU, that is, in more chronic situations. Therefore, the intensity and severity of the episode in patients with
just one episode in our series may be similar to an exaggerated vascular and autoimmune response. An autoimmune
aetiology can be suggested in patients with a unique severe
episode of CSU [3]. However, of note, the methods used to
evaluate some parameters may affect the conclusions, e.g.
it has been reported that manual and automated basophil
counts for CU are markedly inconsistent, and that levels may change during disease activity between blood and
urticarial wheals [32]. Automated counting is not suitable
for assessing the number of basophils in CU. Based on the
current study, we are unable to draw any definitive conclusions due to this and further studies are warranted.

For patients with CSU onset >45 years, fewer presented with concomitant CIndU, excluding factors more
commonly associated with this age group, i.e. blood hypertension or hypercholesterolaemia. A lower prevalence of
CIndU in older patients with urticaria was previously
reported [15]. Regardless of the association with CIndU,
we found that CSU episodes were longer when they started
>45 years [8]. Another interesting finding was the higher
alkaline phosphatase values in patients without other related
hepatic or bone diseases. In our first approach, we suggested
a possible relationship between the high level of alkaline
phosphatase and vitamin D deficiency [8, 33-35]. In fact,
vitamin D has been reported to be involved in the patho

genesis and affect the severity of multiple inflammatory
skin diseases such as chronic urticaria or atopic dermatitis
[36-39].

For up to 22% of our CSU patients, the disease started at
over 65 years. This percentage is higher than previously
reported in the literature (between 4.4 and 9.4%) [15, 16].
It has been proposed that CSU patients >60 years present
with equal gender distribution and less prevalence of serum
autoreactivity [15-17]. Despite this, in our series, we identified a female predominance but less serum autoreactivity
based on ASST scores in patients with CSU onset at older
age (>65 years). The lower level of positive ASST scores in
this subgroup may be explained by the immunosenescence
phenomenon.

Similar to patients with CSU onset >45 years, those with
onset >65 years presented with more age-related comorbidities (i.e. blood hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia
and diabetes) and drug intake was also identified as an
exacerbating factor with a significant effect, compared to
younger patients.

High blood pressure, insulin resistance, and cholesterol
abnormalities in these older patients are features that are
well-characterized in metabolic syndrome. In these subjects, a systemic pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulating
state has been reported leading to more active urticaria [40].
However, regarding the activity of the disease measured
using UAS7 and UAS3w, no differences were identified
between the two groups [15, 16].

Patients with onset of an episode <65 years showed more
concomitant atopy, in contrast to Ban et al. who reported
a higher prevalence of atopy in elderly patients [16].
The presence of more concomitant atopy in our patients
may suggest that a predisposing component exists for
hypersensitivity reactions. No differential laboratory
parameters were identified relative to onset age.

Despite both positive and negative ASST scores, a female
predominance was identified; of those with positive and
negative scores, 80% and 68% were female, respectively.
This gender-related disparity may be explained by the
autoimmune nature of the disease in this subgroup of
patients.

Serum autoreactivity has been recognised in many previous reports as a poor prognosis factor for CSU. Patients
with positive ASST and positive basophil activation test
presented significantly higher scores for UAS, UAS7 and
UAS3w [41]. In the present study, we also found that
patients with positive ASST showed higher scores for UAS7
and UAS3w. Patients with positive ASST also showed more
drug involvement as an exacerbating factor.

Despite several limitations to this study, mainly related to
its retrospective nature and single-centre design, the current
data appear to suggest the usefulness of analysing clinical
differences between CU phenotypes. Clear-cut differences
were detected among the different phenotypes that may
directly affect treatment response (i.e. CSU vs CIndU). In
this sense, specific evaluation of phenotypes may help in
designing a rational therapeutic strategy with subsequent
reduction of disease burden.

 

 

Key points

e ClndU affects men and women equally and occurs
in younger patients with less angioedema, a lower level
of thyroid, less psychiatric comorbidities, and a longer
duration of the disease.

e CSU patients with concomitant CIndU suffer from
atopy more frequently and have fewer thyroid problems and a higher level of disease activity according to
UAS3w.
e Patients with recurrent CSU have shorter episodes that
are clearly triggered and exacerbated by stress. These
patients are less likely to have CIndU and have less CSUrelated psychiatric disorders.

e Onset of CSU in patients >45 years is associated with
a lower incidence of CIndU but with more concomitant
systemic diseases.

e Late-onset CSU (>65 years) is associated with less
atopy and serum autoreactivity. Drugs are an important
exacerbating factor in this age group in which the presence of other concomitant diseases is greater.

e CSU patients with positive serum autoreactivity are
predominantly females with a higher level of disease
activity. Drugs are a frequent exacerbating factor in these
patients.
