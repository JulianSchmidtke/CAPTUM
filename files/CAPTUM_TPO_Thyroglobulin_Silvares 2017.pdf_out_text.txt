Introduction

Abstract

Background Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) may be associated with autoimmune
thyroid diseases, and the Autologous Serum Skin Test (ASST) is an autoreactivity marker.
The thyrotropin (TSH) and TSH receptor (TSHR) could play a role in the pathogenesis of
CSU. The aim of this study was to evaluate ASST positivity and TSHR gene expression in
healthy skin and ASST wheals in euthyroid women with CSU, with (14 patients) and
without (15 patients) Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT).

Methods ASST was performed and TSHR gene expression studied in wheals induced by
ASST and in healthy skin.

Results ASST presented greater positivity (86% x 40%) and larger
(10.8 x 9.6 mm) in the HT group (P < 0.05). TSHR gene expression was higher in the
ASST area and healthy skin of HT group (P < 0.01). Positive correlation of antibodies
levels with ASST wheal measurements and TSHR gene expression was seen.
Conclusions Women with CSU and HT presented greater positivity and larger
measurements for ASST and higher TSHR expression in the skin, suggesting association
between CSU, thyroid autoimmunity, and TSHR.

thyroglobulin (TG), and thyrotropin (TSH) receptor have been
proposed to be involved in its pathogenesis. '5'*

Chronic urticaria (CU), a severe and common condition, has a
great impact on a patient’s quality of life.’ In most cases, the
cause is unknown, thus the condition is known as chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU).°* Autoimmune phenomena are identified in approximately 25-45% of CSU cases characterized by
the detection of IgG class histamine releasing antibodies directed against high affinity IgE receptors (antiFccRI) or against IgE
itself,>° and the Autologous Serum Skin Test (ASST) assesses
such autoreactivity."°”

There are reports of association between CSU and autoimmune thyroid disease,®'° specifically Graves disease (GD) and
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT).'°'? HT is the most common
autoimmune thyroid disease and may evolve to primary hypothyroidism. Autoantigens such as_ thyroperoxidase (TPO),

To strengthen the link between HT and CSU, it has been
observed that this dermatological condition, when associated with
the autoimmune thyroid disease, responds poorly to conventional
treatment, and improvements with levothyroxine use were reported
in some studies.'"'>"” These findings support the research of a
new TSH role, and perhaps of its receptor, in immune response.
Indeed, TSH receptor (TSHR) detection in dermis fibroblasts and
melanocytes indicates that the skin is a target of thyroid axis.'® °°
Thus, both thyroid autoimmunity and hormonal action on the TSHR
could be involved in the pathogenesis of CSU. However, currently,
the mechanisms involved in the relationship between CSU and thyroid disease, particularly HT, are unknown, which raises the question of whether both conditions have a cause-effect relationship or
are two simultaneous autoimmune diseases.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate ASST
positivity and TSHR gene expression in ASST wheals and
healthy skin of euthyroid women with CSU, with and without HT.

Materials and methods

The current study was approved by the Botucatu Medical
School Research Ethics Committee (protocol 341/2007), and all
subjects gave their informed consent. All the procedures
followed were in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of
1975.

Patients

This was a transverse study with 29 female CSU patients seen
at the Urticaria Outpatient Clinic, Botucatu Medical School
(UNESP), Brazil, between July 2008 and May 2009. Of these,
14 had CSU and HT (HT group) and 15 had CSU without HT
(non-HT group). The groups were compared for positivity and
measurements of wheals caused by ASST and physiological
solution as well as for TSHR gene expression in the wheal
caused by the test and in healthy skin. Comparisons were also
made for age and ethnicity, serum TSH, free thyroxin (FT4),
anti-TPO and anti-TG concentrations, and severity of CSU,
through angioedema frequency evaluation.

The inclusion criteria were: female gender, over 18 years of
age, with CSU diagnosis, euthyroid (normal serum TSH and
FT), without the use of any medication for the thyroid, with or
without HT diagnosis, no antihistamine use in the previous
5 days and no immunosuppression drug use in the previous
2 months.?' The following were excluded: those with acute
urticaria, physical urticaria, urticaria vasculitis, those with CU of
a known cause, or systemic diseases such as
connectivopathies, other autoimmune or lymphoproliferative
diseases, and those patients taking other medicines.

Chronic spontaneous urticaria diagnosis was defined by the
presence of daily rashes, or one to three episodes per week,
with and without angioedema, for a period of more than
6 weeks, without detectable cause.* The investigation of the
presence of HT was systematic, and no patient had symptoms
of thyroid disease. HT diagnosis was confirmed by at least
three positive antithyroid antibody measurements (anti-TPO
and/or anti-TG) at different occasions. All patients had normal
serum TSH and FT4, without the use of levothyroxine.

Hormone levels

Serum FT4, TSH, anti-TPO, and anti-TG levels were obtained
by the chemiluminescence method (reference values: 0.70—
1.48 ng/dl; 0.35-4.94 ylU/ml; <5.61 Ul/ml; and <14.4 Ul/ml,
respectively) performed in the institution clinical laboratory.

Autologous serum skin test
ASST was performed after collecting 5 ml of peripheral blood

and centrifuging it for 10 minutes. A quantity (0.05 ml) of the

International Journal of Dermatology 2017

resulting serum was aspirated and intradermally injected into
the arm contralateral to where the blood was collected. The
injection was performed 5 cm from the cubital fossa with a BD
Insulin Syringe and Ultra-Fine™ Needle 31Gx5/16" (0.3 mm
caliber x 8 mm) (Becton Dickinson & Company, Franklin
Lakes, NJ, USA). The size of the wheal caused by the
autologous serum injection was measured 40 minutes after
injection and compared to a wheal from an injection of 0.9%
sodium chloride (physiological solution — PS) performed by the
same technique 5 cm from the site of the serum injection.
ASST was considered positive when the ASST wheal was

1.5 mm larger than the PS wheal.°??-**

All tests were performed by the main researcher (M.R.C.S.).
Wheals were measured in millimeters with a pachymeter.
Immediately after the test wheal measurements (area and
diameter), a biopsy was performed on the wheal and on
standard healthy skin 5 cm from the test. Biopsies were
performed with a 4 mm diameter punch after asepsis, local
anesthesia with 2% lidocaine, and administration of 1 : 1000
adrenalin. ASST wheal and skin fragments were placed in dry
flasks and kept in liquid nitrogen for later study of tissue TSHR
gene expression by real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction).

TSHR mRNA expression

Total RNA was extracted from ASST and healthy skin using
TRizol (Invitrogen, Sao Paulo, Brazil) according to
manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration was determined
by absorbance at 260 nm; all samples had an absorption ratio of
approximately 2.0. One microgram of total RNA was used for the
synthesis of 20 1 of complementary DNA (cDNA) by Super
Script II First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen).
The mRNA levels of TSHR (HSO1053846 m1) were determined
by real-time PCR. Quantitative measurements of cyclophilin
(HS99999904 m1) were made with the commercial TaqMan PCR
kit (Applied Biosystems, Sao Paulo, Brazil) in the detection
system Applied Biosystems StepOne Plus (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA). Cycling conditions were as follows:
enzyme activation at 50 °C for 2 minutes, denaturation at 95 °C
for 10 minutes, amplification of the cDNA in 40 cycles of
denaturation at 95 °C for 15 seconds, and annealing/extension at
60 °C for 1 minute. All samples were assayed in duplicate. Gene
expression was quantified in relation to the values of the healthy
skin group or in relation to the values of the non-HT group, after
normalization by internal control (cyclophilin - HS99999904_m1;
Applied Biosystems) using the 2~“4CT method.?°

Statistical analysis
Sample size was calculated from the pre-test with 10 patients in
each group, with an aim of estimating an alpha level of 0.05
and a power of 0.8 for each variable.

Comparison of clinical and laboratory data between groups
was analyzed with Student's t test or the Mann-Whitney U test
if normality was not identified by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test

(with Lilliefors’ correction). Linear correlation between
measurements of ASST, TSH, FT4, anti-TPO, anti-TG, and
relative TSHR gene expression in ASST was estimated by the
Spearman coefficient (~). Comparison of relative TSHR gene
expression in the ASST wheal and the healthy skin of HT and

test. Percentages relating to ethnicity and ASST positivity were
compared by the chi squared, Fisher's exact, or Goodman test.

serum concentrations, or angioedema frequency. Anti-TPO and
anti-TG antibody concentrations were significantly higher in the
HT group.

The percentage of patients with positive ASST was higher
and ASST wheal diameters were larger in the HT group than
the non-HT group, with no difference between groups in the PS
test (7.0 + 1.6 vs. 7.9+ 1.5mm; P=0.15; Table 2). Wheal
areas were also larger in the HT group but without a difference
between groups for PS test wheals (40.3+ 16.6 vs.
49.9 + 19.2 mm?; P=0.16). TSHR gene expression was
higher in the HT group than in the non-HT group, both in
healthy skin and in ASST wheals (Table 2). TSHR relative gene
expression was higher in ASST wheals than healthy skin in both
the HT and non-HT groups (1.36 + 0.36 vs. 1.00 + 0.23;
1.46 + 0.43 vs. 1.00 + 0.27, respectively; P < 0.01).

Positive correlation was seen between ASST measurements
and antithyroid antibody levels (anti-TPO and anti-TG). TSHR
gene expression correlated with anti-TG and anti-TPO levels.
Gene expression in healthy skin correlated with ASST measurements and with anti-TPO serum concentrations (Table 3). Additionally, there was no correlation between TSHR gene
expression in healthy skin and in ASST wheal, in both HT
(r= 0.03; P = 0.91) and non-HT groups (r= —0.04; P = 0.90).

Discussion

Concomitance of CSU and HT implies a more severe picture of
urticaria, in which the disease is less responsive to conventional
treatment, has a varied response to levothyroxine, and has a
higher positivity to both ASST and antiFceRI and/or against IgE
autoantibodies.'®'”°527-°° Moreover, the frequency of thyroid
autoantibodies is significantly higher in patients with CU than in
healthy controls, and the urticaria duration is associated with
the positivity of these antibodies.°°°' On the other hand, a
recent study comparing patients with CSU and autoimmune
hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine, and euthyroid subjects with CSU, did not observe differences between the groups

regarding the Urticaria Activity Score after 3 and 6 months of

The truth is that the mechanisms which connect CSU and HT
have not yet been explained. In addition, the TSHR represents
one of the HT autoantigens, '* and it is present in skin cells,
suggesting that the epidermis is a TSH signaling target.'*°°
Indeed, thyroid hormones alter skin architecture and homeostasis.°?°° Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate
ASST positivity and TSHR gene expression in ASST wheals
and healthy skin of women with CSU, with and without HT.
Patients were found to be euthyroid, with differences only in the
presence of specific thyroid antibodies, thus minimizing the possibility of hormone impact in the results.

ASST measurements were larger in the HT group than in the
non-HT group. In the literature, there is a lack of ASST measurement standardization. Most studies have evaluated test
positivity or negativity based on means of measurements.*7279
In this study, we observed that ASST measurements correlated
with antithyroid antibodies and with TSHR gene expression.
Grattan et al. (1991) considered ASST area as the measure of
test positivity but did not investigate its relationship with thyroid
autoimmunity.** Similarly, Sabroe et al. (1999) observed larger
wheal diameter, volume, and erythema in addition to reflex erythema in CSU patients compared to healthy individuals.?° Only
Saab et al. (2006) investigated the correlation of ASST measurements with positivity for anti-TPO and anti-TG in CSU and
in healthy controls; they observed larger antithyroid antibody
concentrations and wheal diameters in CU compared to controls, suggesting a relationship between thyroid autoimmunity
and ASST diameter.°° A recent study has shown an indirect
correlation between urticaria and anti-TG.°° However, the exact
role of antithyroid antibodies in CSU remains unclear.

International Journal of Dermatology 2017

Silvares et al.

The percentage of patients with positive ASST was higher in
the HT group, which is in line with the findings of other
authors.'*° Gaig et al. (2000) also observed 55.6% ASST positivity in a series of cases.*’” Fusari et al. (2005) observed positive ASST in 86.7 and 8% of patients with and without HT,
respectively.” However, Mozena et al. (2010) reported no difference in test positivity between patients with and without
HT.%°

Higher positivity and measurements for ASST found in HT
cases and higher anti-TPO concentrations in CSU patients support the idea of a relationship between thyroid autoimmunity
and ASST.?”°°4° There are no studies linking ASST area with
antithyroid antibodies, and this relationship therefore requires
further investigation. In 2006, Saab et al. evaluated positivity
but not ASST dimensions in 68 patients,°° while O’Donnell et al.
(2005) observed that the main influencing factor in anti-TPO
positivity was ASST positivity.’ Recently, Turkoglu et al. (2012),
when evaluating individuals without CU, observed a greater
ASST positivity in HT cases than in healthy volunteers. They
concluded that the patients with HT have more skin mast cell
autoreactivity, regardless of CU presentation.*!

Thyrotropin concentrations were not different between the
two groups, and this hormone was not correlated with the
ASST. Thus, it does not seem that the TSH has been responsible for the observed differences in test responses. On the other
hand, the correlation observed between TSHR gene expression
and antithyroid antibodies with ASST response suggests that
TSHR may play a role in CSU pathogenesis, particularly when
there is an association with thyroid autoimmunity. Therefore,
the mechanisms involved in this relationship, whether by antibodies directed against TSHR or by the TSH stimulation route,
or both, need further clarification. Bod6 et al. (2010) reported
immunoreactivity for TSH in the epidermis of normal individuals,
which is upregulated by hypothalamic TRH and downregulated
by thyroid hormones, and for TSHR in the dermis adjacent to
the epidermis.°° Csaba and Pallinger (2009) observed that stimulus with TSH provoked increased intracellular T; concentrations in lymphocytes, suggesting that the pituitary hormone can
regulate thyroid hormone concentration in immune cells and
influence the course and development of inflammatory dermatitis. However, Bianco et al. (1983) observed that mast cells
presented a regulatory role in the secretion of TSH by the pituitary gland.** Therefore, although histopathological evaluation
was not performed in this study, based on previously quoted literature, the authors suggest that the expression of the TSHR
was present in the fibroblasts and other cells of the healthy skin
and also in the inflammatory cells from the wheal caused by
ASST. This would indicate a relationship between TSH, fibroblasts and, particularly, the inflammatory response, as suggested
by the higher expression of TSHR in the ASST wheal compared
to adjacent skin. Thus, considering that ASST also indicates
mast cell autoreactivity,*' the authors hypothesize that these
cells may represent skin targets for both TSH and autoantibody

action, influencing the clinical picture of CSU associated with
HT. In this context, the greater TSHR expression also observed
in healthy skin of the HT group could indicate a greater influx of
mast cells and other inflammatory cells to the nearby regions of
ASST wheal.

Finally, the authors propose that the ASST wheal can represent a model to study the involvement of thyroid autoimmunity
in CSU pathogenesis, based on the histological similarity of
inflammatory infiltrate,°°** and on the observation that TSH
induces histamine liberation from intrathyroid mast cells,*°*" as
well as on TSH’s capacity to bind to polymorphonuclear and
mononuclear cells and lymphocytes’ from __ peripheral
blood.39:40:42:44

The small sample size, the exclusive use of adult women,
and the lack of a control group of HT patients without CSU are
limitations in this study. However, the consistent results, correlation between variables, and the reproduction of observations
from other publications add strength to the findings.

In conclusion, women with CSU and HT presented higher
ASST positivity and wheal dimensions with higher TSHR
expression in the skin. Positive correlations between antithyroid antibodies and both ASST measurements and TSHR
gene expression in ASST strengthens the evidence for an
association between these two conditions. Moreover, these
findings could suggest a pathogenetic link between thyroid
autoimmunity (particularly, the presence of the anti-TPO),
TSHR, and CSU, which highlights the need for further investigations.
