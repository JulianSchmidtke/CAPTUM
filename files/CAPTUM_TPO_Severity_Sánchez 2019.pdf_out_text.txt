Background. Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a heterogeneous disease with some frequent comorbidities like autoimmune
diseases, drug reactions, and inducible urticaria. IgE antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO IgE) could be associated with
some of these clinical characteristics. Objective. To explore the clinical characteristics of CSU patients, according to the presence of
anti-TPO IgE in serum. Methods. Anti-TPO IgE levels were measured during the clinical control period (Urticaria Activity Score, 0
point) and exacerbation period (23 points) in 100 CSU patients. Patients with self-reported exacerbation of skin involvement by
foods, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and physical triggers underwent controlled challenge tests. Results. We
identified 2 groups of patients: (1) patients with anti-TPO IgE during the clinical control period or during an exacerbation, who
had a higher frequency of atopy, asthma, and positive challenge test results with NSAIDs and (2) patients without anti-TPO IgE
during any period, who had a higher frequency of positive challenge test results for inducible urticaria. Among the first group
(anti-TPO IgE at any point), we identified 3 subgroups: patients with anti-TPO IgE during the clinical control period (n= 12);
patients with anti-TPO IgE during the clinical control period and significantly increased levels during an urticaria exacerbation
(n= 18); and patients with anti-TPO IgE only during an exacerbation (n= 13). None of the patients with self-reported food
reactions had a positive challenge test result. Conclusion. Anti-TPO IgE is a useful biomarker for differentiating between clinical
phenotypes of patients with CSU. Elevation of anti-TPO IgE during exacerbation periods supports an association between this

autoantibody and the pathogenesis of urticaria.

1. Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common cutaneous disease, affecting around 0.3% to 1% of the population
worldwide [1]. Urticaria can appear at any time and has a
marked impact on quality of life. Despite the spontaneous
appearance of CSU, a subset of patients also associate the
onset of symptoms with several triggers, namely, foods (10
to 40%), drugs (10 to 30%), and physical factors (35 to
70%), such as sports, sun exposure, tight clothing, and
temperature (heat, cold) [2-4]. Consequently, patients may
avoid certain activities and stop eating specific foods and
taking drugs they need. These modifications in their activities
of daily living have a considerable impact on the patient and
do not necessarily lead to an improvement in symptoms,

 

because the triggers are not always readily identified by
the patient.

CSU is a heterogeneous disease with various clinical
characteristics. Therefore, it could prove informative and is
clinically important to identify biomarkers able to classify
patients according to their phenotype based on underlying
immunological mechanisms. Moreover, such an approach
would enable us to stratify patients according to their clinical
prognosis [5].

The association between thyroid autoimmunity and CSU
has been evaluated in multiple studies [6, 7]. IgE antibodies
against thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase (antiTPO IgE) are more frequent in CSU patients than in healthy
individuals [8, 9]. Moreover, basophil activation by anti-TPO
IgE suggests that this immunoglobulin could participate in
exacerbations of urticaria [9], and in vivo results show that
anti-TPO IgE can induce wheals in the skin of CSU patients
[8]. Together, these results suggest a role for anti-TPO IgE in
urticaria. Furthermore, evaluation of the clinical characteristics of patients with or without anti-TPO IgE can improve
our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical
characteristics of CSU patients according to the presence
of anti-TPO IgE in serum. We also investigated the role
of anti-TPO IgE in exacerbations affecting the skin of
these patients.

2. Methods

2.1. Study Population. The population assessed in this crosssectional study comprised patients recruited from the
URTICA cohort (URTICA: Urticaria Research of Tropical
Impact and Control Assessment) during the period 2017
to 2018 [10]. The CSU group included patients older than
12 years. This study was approved by the ethics committee
of the clinic “IPS Universitaria” (Registration number
IN40-2016).

Of the 155 patients with CSU who agreed to participate in
the study, 55 were excluded owing to difficulties with serum
sample collection during the exacerbation period; the final
study population was 100 patients.

CSU was defined as the recurrence of hives, with or without angioedema, persisting for at least 6 weeks. The disease
was diagnosed by an allergist or dermatologist. The exclusion
criteria were systemic disease that could explain the hives and
immunodeficiency, dermatitis, or any other disease that
could alter the results of the serum tests. We also excluded
pregnant women, patients with physical or mental disabilities, patients with decompensated cardiovascular disease,
and patients with a chronic disease that could compromise
challenge testing.

We used the Dermatology Life Quality Index to evaluate
the impact on quality of life and the Urticaria Activity Score
(UAS) to measure disease severity. The UAS was carried out
for at least 7 consecutive days; if the patient present an
UAS > 3 points in at least one day, it was considered and
exacerbation and serum sample was not recollected; if after
7 days it has not exacerbated, it was considered a clinical
control period.

 

2.2. Study Design. The main objective was to evaluate the
relationship between anti-TPO IgE and triggers of skin
exacerbations in CSU such as NSAIDs, foods, and physical
activity. As a secondary objective, we compared levels of
anti-TPO IgE in periods of clinical control (UAS 0) or
exacerbation of urticaria (UAS > 3 points). Patients did not
suspend the treatment with antihistamines that they had been
receiving by their treating physician, so the periods of control
and exacerbation occurred in the context of the clinical
course. During exacerbation periods, the patient had hives
and/or angioedema evidenced by the doctor at the same time
the blood sample was taken. The urticaria triggers identified
by patients were recorded in their clinical history. Possible
inducible urticaria triggers, NSAIDs, and foods suspected by

 

Journal of Immunology Research

patients of being triggers of urticaria exacerbations were
assessed directly using challenge tests.

Serum samples were collected from all patients during a
period of clinical control and during 2 periods of exacerbations to determine anti-TPO IgE levels. At least two weeks
were waited between the two exacerbation serum samples.

2.3. Challenge Tests. Patients taking daily second-generation
antihistamines had to suspend their medication for at least
days before the challenge test. Any other drug that could
have affected the outcome of the challenge test was suspended for the minimum time necessary before the challenge
was performed. When patients had an exacerbation before
the challenge test, a new appointment for a challenge test
was offered.

According to the protocol, if patients had experienced a
clear anaphylactic reaction within 1 hour of exposure to the
trigger during at least 12 months before recruitment, the
hallenge test was avoided and considered positive. Howver, none of the patients met this criterion so we did not
exclude any patient from the challenge tests. The protocols
used for challenge tests were based on those proposed in
international guidelines [11, 12], with modifications described
elsewhere [2-4].

3.1. Physical Challenge Test. The 5 most common selfeported sources of inducible urticaria (dermographism,
old, exercise, water, and pressure) [3] were evaluated in all
he study patients, regardless of whether they were selfeported or not. Once the challenge tests were completed,
he participants remained under observation for a period of
2 hours or more depending on the test performed.

2.3.2. Challenge Test with Food. Oral challenge tests with food
were blinded for the patient and placebo-controlled. The test
was performed in patients with self-reported skin exacerbation of urticaria or angioedema. Patients received a portion
equivalent to the expected daily intake of the food investigated. Blinding of food was done by mixing the food tested
with other foods that the patient tolerated and that would
elp neutralize or at least decrease the taste of the food tested.
Before the challenge test, specific IgE (sIgE) determination
and skin prick testing (SPT) with the suspect food were
performed with food extracts. In patients without atopy,
challenge tests were performed by administering the total
‘ood serving in 2 portions separated by 1 hour (10% and
90% of the total serving, respectively). In patients with atopy,
food was administered in 4 portions (10%, 20%, 30%, and
40%). The evaluation period after the challenge test was 4
ours, and the patients were instructed to notify the physician of delayed reactions. Delayed reactions that occurred
in the first 24 hours after the provocation could be associated
with the challenge; in that case, according to the protocol, we
would repeat the challenge again to confirm the relationship.

 

 

 

2.3.3. Challenge Test with NSAIDs. Oral challenge tests with
NSAIDs were blinded for the patient and _placebocontrolled. The test was performed in patients with selfreported skin exacerbation caused by NSAIDs. The
equivalent to 1 daily dose of the drug was administered in 2
Journal of Immunology Research

doses (10% and 90%) separated by 1 hour. In patients with a
history of severe reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis or respiratory
distress), the daily dose was administered in 4 steps (10%,
20%, 30%, and 40%) separated by periods of 1 hour. After
the final dose was administered, the observation period at
the clinic was 4 hours, and patients were also instructed to
report any delayed reactions outside the clinic.

Some patients required a challenge test with 2 or more
substances (e.g., a food and a medication). In patients with
a history of reaction to 2 NSAIDs or 2 foods with crossreactivity, the first test was performed with the least probable trigger (e.g., meloxicam). The second trigger was tested only if
the result with the first trigger was negative (e.g., ibuprofen).

When patients were discharged, they were advised that
in the case of a late reaction, they should take a photograph
and/or visit their health center. A challenge test was considered positive when the patient had hives or angioedema
during the evaluation period. Other symptoms such as
wheezing, diarrhea, and vomiting were also indicative of a
positive test but were recorded separately if hives or angioedema were not present.

For challenge tests with food or medication, the placebo
was administered at the beginning of the test. Subsequently,
the physician performing the test could perform new administrations of placebo. The doctor performing the provocation
was free to administer additional doses of placebo if, for
example, he/she considered that the patient’s pruritus could
be due to anxiety or nerves of the test, always leaving an
interval of at least 20 minutes with the next dose.

2.4. Levels of Anti-TPO IgE. Recombinant TPO was obtained
as previously described [8]. Anti-TPO IgE was measured
using ELISA. The results were expressed as the optical density (OD). The cut-off value (0.304 OD) for serum-specific
IgE to TPO was defined as the mean and 3 times the standard
deviation of absorbance values from 100 healthy controls
without urticaria or autoimmune diseases [8]. Briefly, we
made a calibration curve for each essay. Additionally, in each
run, the samples were placed in duplicate, and a previously
known positive serum control and a negative control (BSA)
were used. Serum as the baseline and during exacerbation
periods was taken in different days.

2.5. Statistical Analysis. The statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version
21.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). The mean was reported for
descriptive variables. The Mann-Whitney test was used to
compare anti-TPO IgE levels according to the cut-off. Pearson’s x? test was used to evaluate differences between groups
and proportions; in groups with a small number of events (<5
events), Fisher’s exact test was used. Correlations were
assessed using the Spearman coefficient (r). We used the
Kruskal Wallis test for quantitative variables (e.g., IgE levels);
when this test revealed a significant difference, a multiple
comparison test was performed to compare the differences
between each possible pair of groups. A p value of <0.05
was considered statistically significant.

Based on the standard deviation observed in a control
group of 100 healthy controls, in patients with positive

anti-TPO IgE during the clinical control period, an increase
in anti-TPO IgE levels during skin exacerbation was defined
as significant if it was greater than 30% of the value recorded
during the period of clinical control. In patients with negative
anti-TPO IgE during the clinical control period, an increase
was considered significant if the OD was greater than 0.304
during the exacerbation. Control subjects were patients over
18 years of age (29 confidence interval; CI 24-38) without
previous or actual history of skin or autoimmune diseases,
angioedema, or anaphylaxis.

Statistical analysis for multiple comparisons was done,
for comparisons among more than two study groups; we
use the Kruskal Wallis test, for quantitative variables (e.g.,
IgE levels).

3. Results

3.1. Population Characteristics. Most patients were female
(Table 1). Forty-three patients had positive anti-TPO IgE
during the clinical control period (UAS 0) or during at least
1 urticaria exacerbation (UAS > 3). In these patients, total
IgE, sensitization to mites IgE (atopy), and asthma were more
frequent than those in patients with negative anti-TPO IgE at
any time (Table 1).

Thirty patients had positive anti-TPO IgE during the
clinical control period (Figure 1(a)). Eighteen (60%) had a
significant increase in anti-TPO IgE during exacerbations
(Figure 1(b)). Thirteen patients without anti-TPO IgE during
the clinical control period presented a significant elevation of
anti-TPO IgE in at least 1 of the 2 exacerbation periods. Fiftyseven patients without anti-TPO IgE during the clinical
control periods experienced no significant change in this
parameter during exacerbations (Figure 1(b)).

In the 43 patients with anti-TPO IgE elevation during the
exacerbation of urticaria, we measured the levels of Der f, Blo
t, and Can f; none of them had a significant increase in ration
at baseline levels (p 0.18, 0.24, 0.12, respectively).

 

3.2. Inducible Urticaria according to Self-Reporting and
Challenge Testing. Seventy patients (70%) suspected at least
1 physical trigger, and 40 identified 2 or more. The most
common self-reported trigger was dermographism (35%)
(Figure 2(a)).

Thirty-four patients (34%) had a positive challenge test
result (Figure 2(a)). The most frequent positive results were
for symptomatic dermographism (24%), followed by cold
(12%), pressure (6%), and exercise (2%). No patients had a
positive challenge test result with water. According to the
challenge test results, 10 patients (10%) had 2 different inducible urticaria.

Patients with negative anti-TPO IgE had a higher frequency of symptomatic dermographism, pressure urticaria,
and cold urticaria than those in patients with positive antiTPO IgE (Table 2). Symptoms during the challenge tests
were mild and disappeared during the observation period.
Adrenaline was not administered in any cases.

Additional physical challenge testing was performed in 4
patients whose exacerbations were strongly suspected of

being caused by other triggers such as heat or sun exposure;
the 4 challenges were negative (data not shown).

3.3. Evaluation of Foods as Triggers of Exacerbation of
Urticaria. Sixty-four (64%) patients reported a reaction
with foods (Figure 3). Of these, 40 patients suspected 2 or
more foods, and 56 (87.5%) had previous history of medical
prescription of elimination diet. According to the self-report,
multiple foods were suspected of causing the reaction: pork
(n=32), sauces (n=30), spicy condiments (n= 20), egg
(n= 19), milk (n = 20), sausage (n = 20), shrimp (n = 4), and
fish (n= 4). Twenty other foods were reported by 1 or 2
patients. According to the SPT, 1 patient had IgE sensitization
to pork, 2 to spicy condiments, 1 to milk, and 8 to shrimp.

We performed a total of 169 food challenge tests in 64
patients including those with a positive SPT result, although
none were positive. During the administration of the placebo,
6 patients reported itching, but none presented objective
reactions; therefore, the challenge test was continued and
was tolerated in all cases, so there was not a positive challenge
test with foods.

3.4. Evaluation of NSAIDs as Triggers of Exacerbation of
Urticaria. Thirty-eight patients reported at least 1 reaction
with NSAIDs (Figure 4); of these, 18 (47%) reported reactions with 2 different NSAIDs. The reactions were reported
with ibuprofen (n = 24), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (n= 18),
meloxicam (n= 10), and acetaminophen (n= 6). A total of
56 NSAID challenge tests were indicated in 38 patients based
on self-reports, although only 46 were performed: 4 patients
refused to undergo the challenge, and 6 patients with selfreported reactions to 2 different NSAIDs had positive results
in the first challenge test. Therefore, according to our study
protocol, additional challenges with NSAIDs were rejected.

Fourteen patients had a positive challenge test result with
NSAIDs; 2 required treatment with adrenaline. Nine of the
14 patients had a positive anti-TPO IgE level; this result
was more frequent than in patients without anti-TPO IgE
(Figure 4).

 

3.5. Clinical Characteristics of Patients with and without
Anti-TPO IgE. The clinical characteristics of patients with
anti-TPO IgE differed from those of patients without
anti-TPO IgE (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)). Patients with antiTPO IgE (during control or exacerbation periods) had a
significantly higher frequency of atopy, total IgE levels,
and asthma; patients without anti-TPO IgE (during the
control and exacerbation periods) had a higher frequency
of inducible urticaria.

No statistically significant differences were observed
when patients were stratified according to anti-TPO IgE
levels during the clinical control or exacerbation periods
(Figures 5(b) and 5(c), and supplementary material
Tables 1 and 2). Despite total IgE was higher in patients
with anti-TPO IgE, correlation of total IgE and anti-TPO
IgE levels was weak (r 0.403, p 0.18).

Autologous serum skin test (ASST) was more frequently
positive in patients with positive anti-TPO IgE; nevertheless,
it was not statistically different than patients with negative
anti-TPO IgE (65% vs 58%, p 0.2). Among patients without
anti-TPO IgE, we observed at the baseline, a tendency to have
a greater number of eosinophils in the peripheral blood
compared to the group with anti-TPO IgE (mean 173 CI
150-312 cells vs mean 142 120-260 cells); however, it was
not statistically significant. We also found no differences with
the number of basophils (CI mean 20 0-60 cells vs mean 18 555 cells). The frequency of thyroid disease and anti-TPO IgG
was less than 15% in the groups. Statistical calculations were
not performed as the number of subjects was not sufficient to
make adequate comparisons.

4. Discussion

CSU is a heterogeneous disease with multiple clinical characteristics. Patients may have angioedema, inducible urticaria,
reactions to NSAIDs, or autoimmune diseases. Biomarkers
can improve our understanding of the underlying
mechanisms of this disease [5, 13] and provide important

Ficure 1: Groups of patients according to anti-TPO IgE level. Patients were evaluated during a period of clinical control (UAS 0) and
two periods of urticaria exacerbation (UAS 23). Thirty patients had (+) anti-TPO IgE during the baseline period and 13 additional
patients (n 43) during exacerbations (a). The number of patients according to the levels of anti-TPO in each period (baseline and two
exacerbations periods) is presented in (b). At least two weeks was waited among the two exacerbation serum samples. OD: optical density.

information that enables us to classify patients according to
different clinical phenotypes.

The presence of anti-TPO IgE may play a role in the
development of CSU, as supported by data from in vitro
and in vivo studies [8, 9]. We recorded production and elevation of anti-TPO IgE levels during skin exacerbations in
patients with CSU; these results support the hypothesis that
there is a relationship between anti-TPO IgE and urticaria.
However, it was not always possible to detect the presence
of this antibody during exacerbations, even in patients with
anti-TPO IgE during periods of clinical control, suggesting
that sometimes, the trigger can be these antibodies, but not
always; other triggers (intrinsic and/or extrinsic) could
explain the other exacerbations. These results do not demonstrate that anti-TPO IgE increases in a short-term fashion; if
the increase in anti-TPO IgE during exacerbations was a progressive process or occurs abruptly was not explored in this

study, since it would require a practically daily sampling of
each patient’s serum before the exacerbation to evaluate if
there was a progressive or abrupt increase in IgE.

Several experimental studies support a relationship
between IgG and IgE antibodies against self-antigens and
urticaria; however, there are many questions that do not
yet have answers but different studies support that these
antibodies can activate and induce the release of histamine
in the basophils of many patients with urticaria. In the case
of anti-TPO IgE, it was recently demonstrated that passive
transfer of serum from a patient with CSU and anti-TPO
IgE to a healthy subject without CSU or anti-TPO IgE
induced the formation of a wheal after TPO exposition
[8]. This result, added to what has been observed in this
study, supports the hypothesis that at least in a group of
patients, IgE anti-TPO can be associated with the formation
of wheals.

Previous studies (mostly with a retrospective design and
small samples) have evaluated anti-TPO IgE as a possible
prognostic biomarker of the duration and severity of CSU.
However, evidence is inconsistent or weak [5, 13, 14]. It
seems that these antibodies can help to identify 2 clinical
phenotypes of patients with CSU: a phenotype associated
with conditions linked to the Th2 response and reactions to
NSAIDs, and a phenotype associated with the presence of
inducible urticaria. This hypothesis is supported by indirect
evidence: asthma, atopy, and high levels of total IgE are more
common in CSU patients than those in healthy controls [8,

15-17]. In tropical urban areas, patients with a history of
cutaneous reactions to NSAIDs had high levels of total IgE
and mite-specific IgE [15, 16, 18], leukotrienes, and major
genes of the IgE response (IL4, IL13), which are important
in reactions to NSAIDs, as they are encoded at the same
cluster in chromosome 5, suggesting a possible common
expression [19, 20]. Shin et al. suggested that anti-TPO IgE
plays a pathogenic role in aspirin-exacerbated cutaneous
urticaria in terms of the expression of CD203c basophils
[21]. The association of negative anti-TPO IgE group with
inducible urticaria could be for different factors; as the

calculation of the sample and the analysis of the outcomes
were done by evaluating the presence of the TPO, the associations observed in the group without TPO can be a statistical
artifact. However, we made corrections for analysis with
multiple variables, and the association between negative
anti-TPO and inducible urticarias (IUs) persists, which
suggested a real association. Little is known about the mechanisms that occur in the different [Us; however, several
hypotheses suggest non-IgE mechanisms (e.g., cholinergic
mediation, terminal nerve receptors) [22].

Various underlying mechanisms may intervene in the

development of CSU in patients without anti-TPO IgE, for
example, IgG against FceRI or IgE [23, 24], activation of the
extrinsic coagulation pathway [25, 26], and IgE against autoantigens other than TPO [27]. It is not clear whether any of
these mechanisms (or others) also play a role in inducible
urticaria or whether they could facilitate its development.
Independent of the underlying mechanism, the clinical characteristics of this group differ from those of the group with
anti-TPO IgE, namely, lower levels of total IgE and lower
frequency of atopy and reactions to NSAIDs.
We did not evaluate the therapeutic response of patients
with CSU, although some studies suggest that high levels o
total IgE have been associated with a better response to omalizumab [28-30]; in fact, one of these studies presents that
patients with anti-TPO IgE have the highest complete
respond rate in all clinical trials with omalizumab in CSU.
According to these results, patients with anti-TPO IgE could
be assumed to have a better clinical response, although we
cannot assume the opposite (i.e., that patients without antiTPO would have a diminished response), because this would
depend on the underlying mechanism [31].

According to the levels of anti-TPO IgE during periods of
clinical control and skin exacerbation, we identified 3 groups
of patients with positive anti-TPO IgE. The responses
according to the levels of anti-TPO IgE led us to ask whether
these 3 groups were part of the same endotype at different
time periods or whether they represented different mechanisms. The answer to this question may also help to clarify
whether the presence of anti-TPO IgE in healthy subjects
represents a risk for the development of urticaria. It is necessary to carry out prospective studies to resolve these issues.

 

 

 

 

 

 

Differences in the prevalence of inducible urticaria and
drug reactions have been reported in different parts of the
world [2-4, 15, 32-37], suggesting that in addition to the
underlying mechanisms, other factors such as sociodemographic characteristics have to be considered as possible
explanation for the discrepancies observed between the
studies. Independent of the type of extrinsic trigger, we
found that inducible urticaria and reactions to NSAIDs—but not to foods—are common comorbidities in patients
with CSU and that self-reporting is usually sufficient to
confirm associations. Therefore, challenge tests must be
offered early during the medical evaluation to establish
appropriate individualized avoidance measures and thus
prevent unnecessary restrictions.

While our results are encouraging, our study is subject to
limitations. Patients who initially had a value below 0.304
OD and during the exacerbation exceeded this value were
considered positive since they exceeded the cut-off. However,
in patients with a value close to the cut-off, this event could
occur due to the expected variation between two tests (interassay variation of 10%) [8]. When we analyzed the increase of
anti-TPO IgE during exacerbations in patients with negative
IgE anti-TPO during the baseline, we observed that all of
them had an increase greater than 30% in the values during
an exacerbation, so it is unlikely that this increase is due to
an error in the accuracy of the test. Given the study design
and the age at recruitment, some clinical characteristics such
as the frequency of autoimmune diseases or the severity of
the disease could not be adequately evaluated between the
anti-TPO IgE groups. Challenge tests with NSAIDs and
foods were only performed in patients who self-reported
their allergy; therefore, the number of reactions to NSAIDs
may have been underestimated. However, from a clinical
point of view, patients who do not have a history of NSAIDs
or food reactions have no contraindications to any medication or food, with the result that it is not necessary for them
to undergo challenge testing. While challenge testing is the
gold standard for confirming the association between an
exposure and the development of immediate symptoms, it
does not ensure 100% tolerance to new exposures: the presence of cofactors (e.g., exercise, alcohol, infections) could
affect the appearance (or nonappearance) of a reaction to a

new exposure with the suspect substance [38-41]. Nevertheless, challenge testing is the most objective method of evaluating the reaction to an extrinsic trigger, and we performed
these tests with NSAIDs, foods, and physical activities in
all cases where testing was indicated; therefore, we consider
that the clinical characterization of the groups was rigorous
and robust.

In conclusion, anti-TPO IgE could be a useful biomarker
for stratifying patients according to clinical phenotypes.
Elevation of anti-TPO IgE during exacerbations supports a
possible association between this autoantibody and the pathogenesis of urticaria which should be explored in more detail.
This article presents new questions and new challenges that
must be investigated. What could be driving the change in
IgE anti-TPO levels? Which changes in IgG anti-TPO antibodies have to be addressed?
