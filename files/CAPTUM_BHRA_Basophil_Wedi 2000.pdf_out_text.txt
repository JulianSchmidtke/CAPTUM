Chronic urticaria serum induces
histamine release, leukotriene
production, and basophil CD63 surface
expression—Inhibitory effects of
anti-inflammatory drugs

Kapp, MD, PhD Hannover, Germany

Background: A role of potential histamine-releasing autoantibodies against the high-affinity IgE receptor on the surface of
basophils and mast cells is discussed in the pathogenesis of
chronic urticaria. This so-called autoimmune urticaria may be
diagnosed by a positive intracutaneous autologous serum skin
test, which is found in about 30% of patients with chronic
urticaria.

Objective: Our purpose was, first, to compare the effect of
complement-inactivated sera of 20 patients with chronic
urticaria and positive autologous serum skin tests, 20 patients
with chronic urticaria and negative skin tests, and 20 control
subjects without chronic urticaria (10 atopic and 10 nonatopic
subjects) and, second, to analyze the effect of anti-inflammatory drugs on the serum activity.

Methods: The following assay systems were used: release of
histamine in whole blood samples, surface expression of the
activation marker CD63 on basophils, and sulfidoleukotriene
de novo production in leukocyte suspensions. Whole blood,
basophils, and leukocyte suspensions were obtained from a
nonatopic and an atopic donor.

Results: Sera of patients with autologous serum skin test positive chronic urticaria resulted not only in significantly
increased histamine release compared with skin test—negative
chronic urticaria sera but also in a significant higher induction
of basophil CD63 surface expression and sulfidoleukotriene de
novo production. However, serum activity was neither characteristic for chronic urticaria nor for chronic urticaria with a
positive autologous serum skin test. Preincubation with dapsone, chloroquine, and lidocaine dose dependently resulted in a
significant reduction of all histamine release, CD63 expression,
and sulfidoleukotriene production. In addition, mizolastine was
able to inhibit serum-induced sulfidoleukotriene production.
Conclusion: Further studies investigating the in vivo effect of
these drugs will have to clarify their role in the management of
the subset of patients with chronic urticaria demonstrating
serum-induced inflammatory effects. (J Allergy Clin Immunol

Chronic urticaria (CU) represents a common skin disease. It is defined by a period of whealing lasting for at
least 6 weeks and often for decades. Urticarial symptoms
are often associated with sometimes life-threatening
angioedema. Because of pruritus and sleeplessness, life
quality is significantly reduced.! Despite an exhaustive
and expensive diagnostic approach, searches for etiologies of CU have been mostly frustrating.? CU can be triggered by infectious disease states, particularly Helicobacter pylori—associated gastritis,3-5 malignancy, or
pseudoallergic reactions.°-7 However, in about 20% to
30% of subjects no cause can be identified.5 Emerging
data give new evidence that autoantibodies to thyroid,’ to
IgE,9!0 and especially to the high-affinity IgE receptor
(Fe RI) may play an important role in the pathogenesis
or the disease activity.!!-!5 These autoantibodies are postulated to cross-link the Fe RI on mast cells or
basophils, resulting in histamine release. However, with
use of an ELISA system for the measurement of antiFe R autoantibodies, these antibodies have also been
demonstrated in other autoimmune disorders such as bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus vulgaris, dermatomyositis,
systemic lupus erythematosus but also in atopic dermatitis.!2 In addition, basophil- and mast cell-stimulating
serum activity was demonstrated to be present only in a
subset of patients with CU!® but not in all patients with
CU and a positive autologous skin test result. Recently
Horn et al!7 found anti-Fe RI autoantibodies lacking histamine-releasing (HR) capacity in multidonor intravenous Ig preparations. Interestingly, these autoantibodies showed strong cross-reaction with tetanus toxoid with
an even higher affinity than for the Fe RI . The authors
deduced that the autoantibodies against Fc RI may
belong to the natural antibodies. The concept of natural
self-reactive antibody repertoires being present in the
serum of healthy individuals and reacting with one or
more self-antigens has been described in detail.!8:!9

Hence the role of these apparently nonspecific autoantibodies for the development or the maintenance of
urticarial symptoms remains to be clarified. At present
the only treatment strategies described so far for autoimmune urticaria are plasmapheresis° and high-dose intra

expensive but also of temporary effect.22

To further clarify the role of serum activity in CU we
investigated the effect of sera from 20 patients with CU
and positive autologous serum skin test (ASST) results,
20 patients with CU and negative ASST results, and 20
control subjects (10 nonatopic [NAT] and 10 atopic [AT]
controls) by measuring not only HR but also basophil
CD63 surface expression and _ leukocyte sulfidoleukotriene (SLT) de novo production. The surface
marker CD63 (glycoprotein 53) is expressed with high
density on activated basophils but only weakly expressed
on resting basophils.?3 It is located in or on the granule
membrane, belongs to the tetraspan family, and is of
unknown function.24.25 The kinetics of CD63 up-regulation and HR were shown to be identical after stimulation
with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP),
grass pollen extract, or anti-[gE mAb.?3.26.27 In addition,
SLT production was assessed because previous studies
have shown that SLT is approximately 100 times more
potent on a molar basis compared with histamine in
inducing wheal-and-flare reactions.28 Furthermore, to
find other treatment schedules in autoimmune urticaria
than intravenous Ig or plasmapheresis, the effect of several anti-inflammatory drugs on serum activity was
investigated. In our hands the standard nonsedating antihistamines were not very effective in the treatment of
autoimmune urticaria. Therefore no antihistamines were
used in the assay systems except for mizolastine, of
which additional anti-inflammatory effects including
leukotriene antagonistic properties have been shown.??
Instead, we considered chloroquine and dapsone, which
have been reported to be effective in urticaria vasculitis,
hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome, and
other antibody-mediated diseases.3°32 Furthermore, the
effect of lidocaine was investigated because very recently lidocaine showed promise as another class of
immunomodulatory drug in allergic diseases.3.34

 

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Drugs and stimuli

Chloroquine, dapsone (4,4’diaminodiphenylsulfone), lidocaine,
and goat polyclonal antihuman IgE mAb were purchased from
Sigma Chemicals (Deisenhofen, Germany). Mizolastine was kindly
provided by the Synthélabo Group (Tours, France). All drugs were
diluted in water, except for dapsone and lidocaine, which were first

Wedi et al 553

dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and further diluted with an appropriate medium to final working concentrations. The highest final
concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide (0.1%) did not affect cellular
function (not shown). Mouse anti-Fe RI mAb (clone 22E7) was
obtained from DPC Biermann, Bad Nauheim, Germany.

Patients, controls, and handling of sera

CU was defined as recurrent wheeling occurring at least twice a
week for more than 6 weeks. In all patients with CU an intracutaneous test with autologous serum was carried out as described.!4
Twenty patients with CU and positive ASST results and 20 patients
with CU and negative ASST results were recruited consecutively
and not screened as to severity. Ten nonatopic healthy subjects and
10 atopic controls with inhalant allergy or atopic dermatitis served
as controls. All sera were stored at —20°C until investigation. For the
HR and the CD63 surface expression experiments, sera were
thawed to room temperature and heated at 56°C 30 minutes immediately before their use to denature IgE and the inactive complement. For the SLT de novo production heat-inactivated and noninactivated sera were compared.

Depending on the density of surface-bound IgE, 2 donors were
selected for all experiments: one nonatopic healthy control (Dar)
and one atopic donor (Day) with extrinsic atopic dermatitis (serum
IgE 58.8 kU/L, specific IgE to seasonal allergens). Both donors did
not receive any drugs. For HR assay and basophil CD63 expression
whole blood was collected into tubes containing heparin, whereas
for the measurement of SLT EDTA-anticoagulated blood was used.

Histamine release

HR was measured in whole blood cells from Dyr and Dar with
use of an enzyme immunoassay (Histamine EIA, Immunotech, Marseilles, France). In detail, 200 oL of whole blood diluted 1:7 in HR
buffer was challenged with 100 oL of sera diluted 1:2, 1:5, and 1:10
for 30 minutes at 37°C. Total cellular histamine was obtained by cell
lysis induced by repeated freezing and thawing. After incubation, the
supernatants were separated by centrifugation at 900g for 5 minutes
at 4°C and acylated. HR was determined according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All HR experiments were done in duplicate and
net specific HR (in percent) was calculated with the following formula: ({Stimulated HR — Spontaneous HR] 100) + Total HR. On
each microtiter plate, subjects of the different groups studied were
mixed to avoid interassay variability. Anti-Fe RI antibodies (0.66
ocg/mL) and anti-IgE (1:1000) served as positive controls.

Basophil CD63 surface expression

Surface expression of the basophil activation marker CD63 was
measured with use of BASOTEST (Orpegen Pharma, Heidelberg,
Germany). Briefly, 100 od of whole blood was preincubated with
20 oL of wash buffer (containing IL-3 at a final concentration of 2
ng/mL) at 37°C for 10 minutes. Then stimulation with 100 oL of
heat-inactivated serum (final dilution 1:2, 1:5, and 1:10) for 20 minutes at 37°C followed. Previous experiments revealed that this
serum dilution gave optimal results. Degranulation was stopped by
chilling on ice for 5 minutes. Thereafter phycoerythrin-conjugated
anti-IgE and FITC-conjugated anti-CD63 mAb were added and
incubated for 20 minutes on ice. Finally whole blood probes were
lysed, fixed, washed, and analyzed within 2 hours on a FACScan
flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson Immunocytometry System, San
Jose, Calif). While the threshold was set in fluorescence 2 (red fluorescence), only basophils with very bright IgE expression were
“live gated.” At least 1000 high IgE-expressing basophils per probe
were acquired and the percentage of CD63-expressing cells was
determined by measuring fluorescence 1 (green fluorescence) compared with the wash buffer serving as negative control (whose mean

ng/mL IL-3. After 10 minutes of priming, heat-inactivated sera were
added (final volume 1:5) and incubated for 40 minutes at 37°C.
Anti-Fe RI mAb (0.55 «g/mL) and anti-IgE mAb (1:1000) served
as positive controls, whereas stimulation buffer served as a negative
control. SLT de novo production was measured with use of the Cellular Antigen Stimulation Test (CAST-ELISA, Biihlmann Laboratories, Allschwil, Switzerland) according to the instructions of the
manufacturer. Values for negative control (background) were subtracted.

Inhibition experiments with antiinflammatory drugs

The following concentrations were used to inhibit serum activity of 4 ASST* patients with CU with striking serum activity on Dap
cells, 10 camol/L to 1 mmol/L dapsone, 100 oamol/L to 1 mmol/L
chloroquine, 100 camol/L to 1 mmol/L lidocaine, and 20 and 200
«g/mL mizolastine. For HR experiments Dar cells were preincubated for 60 minutes with drugs before heat-inactivated sera diluted
1:2 were added and incubated for a further 30 minutes. For CD63
expression studies Day cells were preincubated for 60 minutes with
drugs before sera diluted 1:2 were added and incubated for a further
20 minutes. For SLT production Day cells were preincubated for 60
minutes with drugs before sera diluted 1:5 were added and incubated for a further 40 minutes.

Statistical analysis

Depending on the type of distribution, the statistical significance
between groups was determined by the Student ¢ test or the MannWhitney rank sum test; a statistical software package (SigmaStat for
Windows, Jandel Scientific, Erkrath, Germany) was used. A P value
<.05 was considered statistically significant. Correlation coefficients were calculated with use of the Pearson product moment correlation. For computing the exact probability ofa 2 2 contingency
table, Fisher’s exact test was used. Unless otherwise stated, means
and SEM are shown in the figures.

RESULTS
Histamine-releasing activity of whole blood

Net HR induced by anti-Fc RI mAb and anti-IgE
mAb was significantly higher in the atopic donor (D7)
compared with the nonatopic donor (Dyart) (P < .01
and P < .01, respectively, Fig 1, A). Use of the highreleasing donor Dar sera of CU patients with positive
ASST results (ASST* CU) resulted in a significantly
higher net HR compared with CU patients with negative ASST results (ASST- CU) as well as with NAT
and atopic controls (AT) (Fig 2, A). Serum activity was
dose dependent with maximal induced net HR at a
dilution of 1:2 (Fig 2, A). However, serum-induced HR
was not able to differentiate between CU and NAT or
AT. With use of the nonatopic donor (Dy,y) ASST* CU
sera mediated net HR was higher compared with
ASST- CU sera and sera of controls but not to statistical significance (Fig 2, B). In Dyar, only ASST* CU
sera diluted 1:10 resulted in a significantly higher net
HR compared with ASST- CU sera. ASST* CU serum
activity was about 2.7-fold lower in Dar and 2-fold
lower in Dy,y compared with the effects of anti-Fe RI
mAb (0.66 xg/mL) and about 1.4-fold higher in Day
and 4-fold higher in Dyar compared with anti-IgE
mAb (1:1000).

Induction of basophil CD63 surface expression

The percentage of CD63-expressing cells was significantly higher in Dz after stimulation with anti-Fe RI mAb
(P < .01) and fMLP (P < .001) compared with Dyar (Fig
1, B). This higher capacity of surface CD63 induction could
be demonstrated also by stimulation with ASST* CU sera
resulting in a CD63 expression in Daz that was about 2-fold
higher than in Dyar (Fig 3, A and B). In Dxp ASST* CU
sera resulted in a significantly higher induction of the
basophil activation marker CD63 compared with ASST—
CU sera, as well as to the NAT and AT controls (Fig 3, A).
However, in Dyxy ASST* CU sera—induced effects reached
significance only when compared with ASST- CU sera but
not with NAT or AT (Fig 3, B). In both donors serum activity was dose dependent, showing the highest CD63 expression with a dilution of 1:2. ASST*+ CU serum activity was
about 1.6-fold lower in Day and 3.3-fold lower in Dyar
compared with the effects of anti-Fe RI mAb (0.33 g/mL)
and about 1.2-fold lower in Dy and 2.5-fold lower in Dy
compared with fMLP (1 oamol/L).

SLT de novo production

Stimulation with anti-Fe RI mAb resulted in a significantly higher SLT release in Day compared with Dyaz (P<

and nonatopic donor was not so evident when serum activ

ity was analyzed (Fig 4, A and B). In contrast, with use of
non-heat-inactivated sera, SLT production in Dy; was
slightly higher with ASST- CU and control sera. On the
whole, sera that were not heat inactivated showed significantly higher SLT de novo production compared with heatinactivated sera. This may imply participation of complement components or of anti-IgE autoantibodies in the sera.
However, in Dar heat-inactivated, like noninactivated
ASST* CU, sera resulted in a significant higher SLT production compared with ASST- CU sera, NAT, and AT sera
(Fig 4, A). In Dyay serum-induced SLT production did not
reach statistical significance except for non-heat-inactivated ASSTt CU sera compared with AT sera (Fig 4, B). In
comparison to the effects of anti-Fe RI mAb (0.55 «g/mL)
ASST* CU serum activity was about 11.7-fold lower in
Dar and 8.8-fold lower in Dyy with use of heat-inactivated sera and about 4.7-fold lower in Day and 1.7-fold lower
in Dyar When sera were not heat inactivated.

Comparison of HR, CD63 expression, and SLT
production

Not all ASST* CU sera showed activity in all the assay
systems tested, namely HR, CD63 expression, or SLT
556 Wedi et al

production (Table I). A significant number of sera
demonstrated only one or two of these activities. Taken
together, 25% of sera did not have any activating effect in
the Dar and 30% in the Dyar, although ASST was positive in all these patients. There was no significant correlation between HR and CD63 expression, HR and SLT
production, or CD63 expression and SLT production.
However, serum activity in ASST* CU sera seemed to be
associated with higher urticarial activity, defined by a
higher frequency of daily symptoms and the occurrence
of angioedema (Tables I and II). Seventy-five percent of
ASST* CU patients showed daily symptoms and 45%
had concurrent angioedema compared with 45% and
15% in ASST- CU, respectively. Duration of CU (40 +
57 months in ASST* CU and 41 + 14 months in ASSTCU) was not associated with serum activity or positive
ASST. Interestingly, we found a higher but nonsignificant prevalence of antibodies to thyroid in patients
demonstrating serum activity (35% in ASSTt CU vs 15%
in ASST- CU). In ASST* CU sera median total serum
IgE levels were lower (68 kU/L) compared with ASSTCU sera (119 kU/L), but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = .0742).

Inhibitory effect of anti-inflammatory drugs

A short preincubation period with chloroquine (1
mmol/L), dapsone (1 mmol/L), and lidocaine (1 mmol/L)
significantly and dose dependently inhibited HR (Fig 5,
A), CD63 expression (Fig 5, B), and SLT de novo production (Fig 5, C). However, mizolastine (200 «g/mL)
only induced a significant inhibition of SLT production.
These inhibitory drug concentrations were not cytotoxic
as assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion (not shown). In
an additional experiment it could be demonstrated that
the above-mentioned drugs were also able to inhibit antiFe RI mAb-induced HR, basophil 63 expression, and
SLT production in Dar (not shown).

DISCUSSION

Our data confirm previous published results demonstrating that not in all patients with CU,°5 and even not in
all patients with CU and positive ASST results, serum
shows HR activity.!5 Hide et al!© showed 65% of CU sera
with positive ASST inducing HR when human basophils
were used. Fiebiger et al!2 demonstrated anti-Fc RI
mAb in 37% of chronic urticaria sera but ASST was not
done. They found 66% histamine-releasing activity in
anti-Fe Rl-autoantibody* CU sera and 17% in autoantibody- CU sera. With use of their criterion (HR >15% of
anti-Fe RI mAb-positive control), in this study we found
55% sera with HR activity among the ASST* CU
patients, 15% among the ASST- CU patients, 30%
among the atopic controls, and 10% among the nonatopic
controls (analyzing donor Dar). Thus the frequency of
serum HR activity in CU patients was comparable to that
of previously published data, although in our study
whole blood was assessed, in contrast to basophilenriched leukocyte suspensions.

pg/ml SLT

For the first time, we clearly demonstrated that the
serum of a subgroup of CU patients with positive ASST
does not only show histamine-releasing activity but also
induction of the basophil activation marker CD63 and
SLT de novo production. Compared with HR, even more
ASST* CU sera induced CD63 expression or SLT production (Table I). With use of the atopic donor, increased
CD63 expression was found in 70% of ASST* CU
patients and 45% of ASST- CU patients, but only in 35%
of controls. Interestingly, HR and CD63 surface expression did not show a significant correlation, although this
was indicated by previous studies with fMLP, anti-IgE,
or pollen antigens as stimuli.227.36 Similarly, there was
no significant correlation between HR and SLT production or SLT production and CD63 surface expression.
This fits with other studies concluding that leukotriene de
novo production and the release of preformed histamine
are regulated differentially.3738 After heat inactivation
serum activity significantly declined regarding induction
of SLT production, suggesting that the classic complement pathway may be involved in this serum activity.
Another possibility might be the presence of anti-IgE
autoantibodies in the sera.

Confirming previous results,>59 our data indicate the
presence of histamine-releasing serum activity particularly in subjects with more severe and active urticaria

including concurrent angioedema and daily symptoms.
Moreover, serum-induced basophil CD63 expression and
SLT production were also found to be more frequent in
subjects with severe urticaria. Nevertheless, although
serum-induced HR, CD63 expression, and SLT production were more frequent in ASST* CU patients, these
activities were neither characteristic for ASST* CU
patients nor for CU at all.

Moreover, the ubiquitous presence of anti-Fe RI
autoantibodies in human serum has been demonstrated.!7
These autoantibodies seem to be nonpathogenic with the
exception of chronic urticaria. Until now, anti-Fe RI
autoantibodies with histamine-releasing activity were
considered to be specific for chronic urticaria. This is
also confirmed by our data (Tables II and III).

However, our data show that serum-induced basophil
CD63 surface expression and de novo SLT release can
also be found in atopic and nonatopic control subjects
without chronic urticaria.

Taken together, CU serum activity inducing HR,
CD63 expression, and SLT production cannot be used as
a diagnostic marker for CU but may identify a subset of
CU patients with more severe disease and autoimmune
pathogenesis. In this regard it is noteworthy that we
found a higher prevalence of antibodies to thyroid in
ASST* CU sera demonstrating serum activity. Thirtyfive percent of ASST* CU patients had autoantibodies to
thyroid, in contrast to 15% of ASST- CU patients.

FIG 5. Inhibitory effect of anti-inflammatory drugs on net histamine release (A), percent CD63-expressing basophils (B), and SLT
production (C) induced by heat-inactivated sera of 4 ASST* CU
patients with high serum activity. Serum, incubation with serum
alone (dilution 1:2); Fe RI, incubation with Fe RI mAb alone (for
mAb concentrations see legend to Fig 1). Open bars, Serum coincubated with concentration 1 (ie, 1 mmol/L chloroquine [CH], 1
mmol/L dapsone [Daps], 200 «g/mL mizolastine [Mizo], and 1
mmol/L lidocaine [Lido]). Hatched bars, Serum coincubated with
concentration 2 (ie, 100 «mol/L chloroquine [CH], 100 «mol/L dapsone [Daps], 20 «g/mL mizolastine [Mizo], and 100 «mol/L lidocaine [Lido]). In A preincubation with drugs was for 60 minutes,
sera were diluted 1:2; in B drug preincubation was for 30 minutes,
sera were diluted 1:2; and in C drug preincubation was for 40 minutes, and sera were diluted 1:5. Asterisk, P < .05; two asterisks, P
< .01 compared with serum.

Although this difference was not statistically significant,
it is notable that thyroid autoimmunity occurs in less than
6% of the general population.’ Thus in the ASST* subset
chronic urticaria symptoms may express a latent autoimmune disease.

Previous attempts to treat these patients consisted of
plasmapheresis or high-dose intravenous Ig and were of
temporary success. In this study we found significant
inhibitory effects of 4 anti-inflammatory drugs on seruminduced inflammatory effects, namely, chloroquine, dapsone, lidocaine, and mizolastine. However, mizolastine
resulted in a significant inhibition of serum-induced SLT

production only. Mizolastine represents a nonsedating
second-generation antihistamine with additional antiinflammatory effects, including the inhibition of neutrophil migration, and leukotriene antagonistic properties
that may be mediated by inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase.2?
Mizolastine has been shown to be effective in the treatment of allergic rhinitis*© and CU.4! Apart from mizolastine, lidocaine was shown to significantly inhibit serum
activity. In a preliminary in vivo study lidocaine showed
promise as another class of immunomodulatory drugs that
can be substituted for glucocorticoids in the treatment of
asthma.*3 This was confirmed by recent studies pointing
to lidocaine as a first nontoxic steroid alternative for
patients with severe steroid-dependent asthma.*4 Up to 1
mmol/L lidocaine was demonstrated to inhibit activation
and survival of eosinophils in a noncytotoxic manner.42
The mechanism of lidocaine-mediated immunomodulation may involve leukocyte Na* channels*3 or the moduation of intracellular pH.42 Our data point to a further
immunomodulatory effect of lidocaine, namely, the inhibition of HR, basophil CD63 expression, and SLT production. In addition, dapsone showed marked inhibitory
effects on seruminduced basophil activation. For many
years dapsone has been the drug of choice for the treatment not only of malaria and leprosy but also a number of
noninfectious inflammatory conditions associated with
neutrophil infiltration such as rheumatoid arthritis,44 bullous pemphigoid,*> leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and dermatitis herpetiformis.46.47 However, the exact mechanism
of its anti-inflammatory action is not fully understood.48
Dapsone inhibits neutrophil adhesion, chemotaxis,
ipoxygenase activity, and the cell’s ability to generate
reactive oxygen species.49-52 Although CU is sometimes
associated with a neutrophilic infiltrate and is then termed
neutrophilic urticaria, most lesions are not characterized
by neutrophil predominance.5354 Hence dapsone may
have additional anti-inflammatory effects on other leukocyte types, such as basophils. Interestingly, in 1991 Cox
and Friedmann>> observed urticated papules and plaques
8 to 24 hours after performance of autologous serum
skin tests. In this aspect it is noteworthy that dapsone
treatment leads to a dramatic improvement of dermatitis
herpetiformis. Thus dapsone may inhibit serum-mediated
pathogenic effects in dermatitis herpetiformis as well as
in autoimmune urticaria.

Moreover, chloroquine showed significant inhibitory
effects on serum activity. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been used for many years in the treatment of lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and
malaria. Chloroquine is thought to have immunosuppressive effects by inhibition of MHC class II antigen presentation and the production of inflammatory cytokines
such as TNF- , IL-1 , and IFN- .5657 Chloroquine raises the pH of phagolysosomes and may induce basophilic
differentiation of HL-60 cells by increasing the intracellular pH.58 In neutrophils and monocytes hydroxychloroquine reduced superoxide production and release,>? and
a significant decrease on neutrophil lysosomal enzyme
activity has been shown,® raising the possibility that

such effects extend to other leukocytes. In a double-blind
placebo-controlled study treatment of moderate asthmatics, 30 weeks of hydroxychloroquine resulted in a significant improvement of airflow and a significant fall of
serum IgE levels.°! These data point to a modulation of
Ig levels.

Taken together, this study clearly demonstrates that a
subset of patients with CU and positive ASST is not only
characterized by serum activity resulting in HR but also
in the induction of basophil CD63 expression and SLT
de novo production. However, the clinical relevance of
this CU serum activity and the reason for targeting the
skin but not the nose or the lungs are far from being
clear. Nevertheless, apart from dapsone, mizolastine,
and lidocaine, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may
be interesting drugs for the treatment of autoimmune
urticaria particularly because of their remarkably benign
toxicity profile. Further controlled studies are needed to
elucidate a potential beneficial effect of these antiinflammatory drugs in the treatment of a subset of
patients with CU showing serum activity by means of
HR, induction of basophil CD63 surface expression, and
SLT production.
