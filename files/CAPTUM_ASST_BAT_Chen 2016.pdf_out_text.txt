Abstract

Background: The underlying causes and factors contributing to the disease severity of
chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) are unknown.

Objective: Given the important role of basophils in the pathogenesis of urticaria and that
CD63 serves as a useful marker for basophil activation and detecting CD63 expression of
basophils is a reliable tools for diagnosing allergy and hypersensitivity reactions to different
allergens, the objective of this study was to investigate whether the level of basophil CD63
expression is correlated with allergen sensitization, serum autoreactivity, and basophil
reactivity in patients with CSU. Methods: Basophil-enriched leukocytes were separated from
the blood of 64 patients with chronic urticaria (54 CSU patients and 10 symptomatic
dermographism patients), 18 healthy control subjects, and 7 atopic donors without urticaria.
Flow cytometry was then used to detect CD63 expression on the cell membrane of basophils
from all samples. Analysis was also preformed on basophils incubated with sera from CSU
patients with positive or negative autologous serum skin test (ASST).

Results: CD63 expression was significantly higher in the basophils from patients with CSU
than in those from patients with symptomatic dermographism and the healthy control group.
The levels of CD63 expression in CSU patients with ASST+ and/or allergen sensitization were
higher than those with ASST- and/or no allergen sensitization patients. Incubation with

ASST+ serum resulted in an increased expression of CD63 in the basophils of ASST+ CSU

patients, whereas no such response was observed in healthy controls or ASST- CSU patients.
Conclusion: The increased CD63 expression in basophils from CSU patients may correlate
with allergen sensitization, autoreactivity of serum, and basophil reactivity. Our results

suggest that CD63 may contribute new insight into the pathogenesis of CSU.

Introduction

Chronic urticaria is a common skin disease that can be classified into spontaneous and
inducible forms according to the 2014 European Academy of Allergy and Clinical
Immunology (EAACI) guidelines.’ Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is characterized by the
spontaneous appearance of wheals and/or angioedema for more than 6 weeks, and
symptomatic dermographism is characterized as wheals that can be induced by mechanical
force. CSU and symptomatic dermographism are the most common subtypes of chronic
urticaria worldwide, including in the Chinese population.” Although the pathogenesis of
chronic urticaria has not yet been clearly defined, previous studies have demonstrated that
mast cells and basophils play important roles in inducing the symptoms by releasing
inflammatory mediators and cytokines upon activation.’ Basophils are the rarest type of
leukocytes in human peripheral blood, making up less than 0.5% of the total white blood cell
count in healthy individuals. Decreased basophil numbers in patients with CSU indicate their
role in the activation and function of the cells.*°

CD63 is a tetraspanin normally expressed only on the membrane of the lysosomes in the
inactive basophils and mast cells. Upon activation, it moves to the surface of basophils along

with degranulation.® Therefore, CD63 is deemed a specific and reliable surface activation

marker of basophils. The basophil activation test (BAT) by detection of basophil CD63
expression with flow cytometry after induction of patient sera has proven to be a useful tool
for detection of functional autoantibodies relevant to autoimmune reactions in chronic
urticaria’ and the diagnosis of allergy and hypersensitivity reactions to different allergens.°°
CD63 expression has also been shown to be higher in IgE-mediated immediate allergic
diseases such as asthma, rhinitis, anaphylaxis and atopic dermatitis," but its role in chronic
urticaria remains unclear. One study showed that both allergic subjects and CSU subjects
had increased basophil CD63 expression when compared with non-allergic subjects.”

In our previous study, we found that patients with a positive autologous serum skin test
(ASST) and/or house dust mite sensitization had increased disease activity and a longer
disease course compared to patients with a negative ASST and/or no allergen sensitization.”
This suggests that there may be some subtle differences in the pathogenesis of CSU between
ASST-positive and -negative patients, which may be relevant for determining a specific
therapeutic schedule and prognosis judgment. The current study was focused on the
activation status of circulating basophils in subtypes of chronic urticaria, in particular CSU
patients showing different responses to ASST and skin prick test (SPT). By evaluating the
expression of CD63 on the surface of basophils in patients with CSU and symptomatic
dermographism, we aimed to explore the possible correlations among allergen sensitization,

serum autoreactivity, and basophil reactivity.

Materials and Methods

Subjects

A total of 78 patients (30 males, 48 females; mean age, 36.82 years; age range, 5-77 years)
with chronic urticaria who visited the dermatology clinic of Southwest Hospital (Chongqing,
China) from April 2013 to March 2016 were randomly selected and enrolled in this study. All
patients met the EAACI/GA2LEN/European Dermatology Forum guidelines on chronic
urticaria (the disease duration between 6 weeks and 20 years) and provided fully informed
consent. Among them, there were 68 patients with CSU (36 cases were ASST-positive and 32
cases were ASST-negative, 9 cases with positive dermographism) and 10 patients solely with
symptomatic dermographism. All of the patients were being treated with non-sedating oral
H1-antihistamines and the treatment was stopped at least 3 days before blood sample
collection. Eighteen sex- and age-matched healthy subjects without any type of urticaria and
being negative to both the ASST and SPT were enrolled as the normal control group. In
addition, 7 patients with atopic dermatitis and without any subtype of urticaria were
enrolled as the atopic control group for reference The study protocol was approved by the
ethical committee of the Southwest hospital of Third Military Medical University, Chongqing,

China.

SPT
The SPT was performed by placing a drop of allergen solution (Allergopharma™ Skin Prick
Testing Kits, Reinbeck, Germany) on the inner side of the forearm, as described previously.*°

The allergens included the house dust mites Dermatophagoides farinae and

Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, cockroach allergen, mugwort pollen, humulus pollen, fish
(catfish), shrimp, crab, egg, cow milk, and peanut. Saline and histamine phosphate (10
mg/mL) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Antihistamines were
withdrawn at least 3 days before the test. The skin response was measured at 30 min after
pricking, as previously described’. A patient with a postive SPT result to one or more

. . wae . 8-12
common allergens was considered to show allergic sensitization (atopy)” ~.

ASST

The ASST was performed according to established methods.*”™ In brief, 0.05 mL of sterile
autologous serum was injected intradermally, with 0.05 mL of 10 g/mL histamine and
normal saline as positive and negative control, respectively. Skin areas involved in a
spontaneous wheal reaction during the previous 24 h were avoided. The wheal size was
recorded at 30 min. The ASST was considered positive, when the wheal size diameter was at
least 1.5 mm greater than that of the negative control. Positive ASST was indicated as serum

autoreactivity in the present paper.

Isolation of basophil-enriched leukocytes and serum collection

A 10-mL peripheral blood sample was collected by venipuncture in a collection tube with
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, centrifuged at 1600 rpm for 10 min, and then the
supernatant was sucked off and the plasma was stored at -80°C for further use. To obtain
the basophils, the same volume of free Ca** and Mg” D-Hanks’ phosphate buffered saline

(PBS) was added after removing the supernatants, and blended. The liquids were then

carefully tiled beyond the Ficoll-Paque PREMIUM 1.084 separation medium (GE Healthcare,
England) at a volume ratio of 2:1, and centrifuged at 1550 rpm for 30 min. The
basophil-enriched leukocytes at the interlayer were sucked up, aspirated, and washed twice
with free Ca’* and Mg”* D-Hanks’ PBS. The cells were resuspended and then the
basophil-enriched leukocytes were isolated. Serum was collected with tubes without any

anticoagulant.

Stimulation of basophils

To evaluate the responses of basophils to different types of triggering factors, the basophils
were equally divided into six tubes. One tube of cells was used for detection of CD63
expression immediately after basophil isolation. Three tubes of cells were incubated with
sera from ASST-positive CSU patients, sera from ASST-negative CSU patients, and sera from
healthy donors, respectively. The other two tubes of cells were incubated with free Ca** and
free Mg”* D-Hanks’ PBS as the negative control, and with 10° mol/mL of the non-specific cell
activator N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (BD FastImmune; Becton-Dickinson, San
Jose, CA, USA) as the positive control, respectively. All tubes were incubated for 30 min at

37°C. The reaction was stopped by cooling the tubes on ice.

Detection of CD63 expression
After the reaction was stopped, the cells were stained with 15 uL of CD63-FITC/CD123-PE/
anti-HLA-DR-PerCP antibody cocktail (BD FastImmune; Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA)

and incubated for 30 min at 4°C. The samples were lysed, washed, and resuspended in 300

pL of 0.5% paraformaldehyde, and were then measured in a flow cytometer (FACScan;
Becton-Dickinson Immunocytometry System, San Jose, CA, USA) within 1 h. For analysis, a
first gate using the forward-scattered/side-scattered light characteristics of leukocytes was
defined, and then CD63+ CD123+ HLA-DR-basophils were identified as described

previously.*>*°

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism version 5.01 software
(GraphPad Software Inc.: San Diego, CA, USA, 2007). The Mann-Whitney U-test or the
Wilcoxon matched-pairs test was used, as appropriate, to determine significant differences
between groups. All data are shown as medians and the difference was considered

significant at a P-value of less than 0.05.

Results

CD63 expression is increased in CSU

The expression of CD63 was detected on the cell membrane of basophils collected from
subjects with CSU (n = 45), CSU with positive dermographism (n = 9), purely symptomatic
dermographism (n = 10), and the normal controls (n = 18). As shown in Fig. 1, the mean
percentage of CD63+ basophils was significantly higher in the CSU than in the symptomatic
dermographism samples (both P < 0.05) and normal controls (both P < 0.001), and the
expression level in the symptomatic dermographism samples was also significantly higher
than that in the normal controls (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference

between the CSU and CSU with positive dermographism samples (P = 0.70).

CD63 expression is increased in CSU patients with allergic
sensitization

CD63 expression was also compared among the atopic patients (n = 7), normal controls (n =
11), and CSU patients with (n = 30) and without (n = 24) allergic sensitization. As shown in
Fig. 2, CD63 expression of the atopic patients was significantly higher than that of the
normal controls (P < 0.05). Furthermore, CD63 expression of the CSU with allergic
sensitization patients was significantly higher than that of the other three groups (all P <
0.01), and the CSU without allergic sensitization patients also showed higher CD63

expression than the normal controls (P < 0.01).

Higher CD63 expression in CSU is related to both allergen
sensitization and serum autoreactivity

We then divided the CSU patients into four groups according to the results of the ASST and
SPT, as ASST+SPT+ (n = 16), ASST+SPT- (n = 13), ASST-SPT+ (n = 14), and ASST-SPT- (n = 11),
for further analyses. As shown in Fig. 3, the CD63 expression levels of four subtypes of CSU
patients were significantly higher than that of the normal controls (all P < 0.05). Furthermore,
the CD63 expression of the ASST+SPT+, ASST-SPT+ and ASST+ SPT- groups were all

significantly higher than that of the ASST-SPT- group (all P < 0.05).

Both serum autoreactivity and basophil reactivity contribute to the
higher CD63 expression in CSU

To further investigate the possible roles of sera autoreactivity and basophil reactivity on
CD63 expression, the basophils of CSU patients (n = 22) and normal controls (n = 10) were
incubated with ASST+ serum or ASST- serum, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4a, the basophils
of CSU patients incubated with ASST+ serum showed significantly higher CD63+ expression
than those incubated with ASST- serum (P < 0.05). Such differences could not be observed

on the basophils collected from the normal controls (P = 0.4675) (Fig. 4b).

Next, we divided the basophils of CSU patients into ASST+ basophils (basophils from ASST+
patients, n = 11) and ASST- basophils (basophils from ASST- patients, n = 11) groups
according to the patient’s response to the ASST. We found that CD63 expression of ASST+
basophils was significantly higher when incubated with ASST+ serum than that incubated
with ASST- serum (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in CD63 expression between
ASST- basophils incubated with ASST+ and with ASST- serum (P = 0.9658) (Fig. 4c). What’ s
more, as shown in Fig. 4c, the ASST+ basophils expressed higher CD63 than ASST- basophils
when they were both incubated with ASST+ serum (p < 0.01). We further to confirmed this
by using the other 7 sets of sera to incubated one set of basophils, and we got similar results

(data was not shown).

Discussion
Our present study showed that CD63 expressions on the surface of circulating basophils are
increased in CSU patients comparing to that in any of the other subtypes, which was in line

1125, and the levels of CD63 expression in CSU patients with ASST+

with earlier reports
and/or allergen sensitization were higher than those with ASST- and/or no allergen
sensitization patients.

The allergic sensitization in chronic urticaria patients has been found to be higher than that

in healthy subjects. However, the significance of allergic sensitization in the

pathogenesis of CSU is still a matter of debate,
study to directly address this question. In line with the findings of Vasagar et al, our results
also showed a significant increase of CD63 expression on the surface of circulating basophils
in both the CSU and atopic groups.’* CD63 expression in the CSU patients with allergic
sensitization was significantly higher than that without sensitization. It has been proposed
that a positive SPT to common allergens indicates allergic reaction or sensitization.”” Since
CSU patients with SPT+ had a higher urticaria activity score than those with a SPT-,”” our
results about a higher level of spontaneous basophil activation in CSU patients with allergic
sensitization suggested that allergic sensitization may be an underlying factor contributing to
the pathogenesis of CSU.

In about half of CSU cases, a positive reaction to autologous serum test implying histamine
releasing factors in serum, is found, which is termed as autoreactive chronic urticaria.

Autoantibodies to either the a-chain of high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRla) or IgE itself in

ASST-positive serum may be the main factor responsible for the spontaneous activation of

basophils in patients with CSU. Studies showed that sera from CSU patients with a positive
ASST result could induce higher CD63 expression on the basophils of atopic donors in

vitro.2* 76

In our previous study, we observed that CSU patients that were positive for ASST
had greater scores of disease activity and dermatology QoL index (DLQI), higher doses of
total antihistamine medication required every month and higher frequencies of angioedema
compared with patients with negative ASST.2,12 Present results indicated that both serum
autoreactivity and basophil reactivity contribute to the higher CD63 expression in CSU.
Further investigation is needed to see whether CD63 expression on basophils is correlated
with the disease severity .

Luquin et al.27 reported that basophils from chronic urticaria patients were
hyper-responsive to serum either from healthy individuals or from patients with CSU. We
found that basophils from CSU patients were hyper-responsive to sera from CSU patients
with ASST+ but not to those with ASST-. And only basophils from ASST+ patients but not
basophils from ASST- patients showed a significantly higher CD63 expression after
incubation with ASST+ sera. These results imply that both histamine releasing factors in sera
and the intrinsic potential of basophils may contribute to the expression of CD63 and
basophil activation.

It is unclear why ASST+ and ASST- basophils have different response to ASST+ serum. Human
basophil reactivity can be modulated by different factors such as activation of
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs by IgE/IgG/allergen complexes,
downregulation of FceRla, inhibitors such as IgG and IgA immunocapture, and activators in

the presence of priming cytokines IL3 and IL5.28 For a given immunological status, basophil

reactivity may also depend on the concentrations of the allergen and autoantibodies, affinity
of the specific IgE to the allergen, inter-epitope distance, contact delay between the allergen
and related membrane receptor-bound specific IgE, and intrinsic basophil reactivity.29-31

In summary, our data showed higher but different CD63 expressions on the surface of
circulating basophils from patients with different subtypes of chronic urticaria based on ASST
and SPT response. The expression level of CD63 on basophils from CSU patients are
correlated with allergic sensitization, serum autoreactivity and intrinsic potential of the

basophil, which may provide new clues to understand the underlying pathogenesis of CU.
