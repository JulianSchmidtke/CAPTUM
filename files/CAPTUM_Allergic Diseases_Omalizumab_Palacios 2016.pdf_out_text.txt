TO THE EDITOR

Chronic urticaria (CU) is defined as recurrent, transitory, pruritic-raised wheals present on
most days of the week for >6 weeks!. The pathogenesis of CU is unknown; but it is thought
to be the result of autoimmunity, at least in some patients. Evidence supporting this comes
from assays suggesting the presence of functional autoantibodies. IgG autoantibodies to IgE
or to the high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) have been directly detected in ~40-50% of CU
patients.? While of interest, identifying these antibodies is laborious and not fully validated,
therefore, numerous surrogate assays have been developed. A positive autologous serum
skin test (ASST) can be identified in 30-67% of CU patients? and is an indirect reflection of
autoantibodies. However, the ASST is positive in 37% of non-CU patients?, making it of less
certain clinical relevance. Alternatively, the sera of 40-50% of CU patients can induce the
release of histamine from the basophils of healthy subjects (basophil histamine-releasing
assay, HRA).‘ Limitations to this test are based on inter-laboratory reproducibility and
variation in healthy basophil donor characteristics;2 and as with the ASST, the HRA lacks
diagnostic specificity for CU. More recently, flow cytometry has been used to evaluate the
ability of CU patients’ serum to activate donor basophils as determined by the upregulation
of CD203c (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase)> In the validation studies
for this assay, the upregulation of CD203c surface expression was evaluated on basophils
obtained from a healthy atopic donor after exposure for 10 minutes to serum obtained from
32 CU patients and 11 healthy controls. (see Yasnowsky et al.> for more detailed
description). The data are expressed as the percent of basophils expressing more CD203c
than 99% of basophils incubated with buffer only. A result >5% is highly specific for CU as
this result was never seen using serum obtained from healthy controls®. Serum factors
driving increased CD203c-expression in this assay are unknown and as with the HRA are
assumed to reflect autoantibodies, however this has never been determined. Furthermore,

factors driving histamine-release from basophils may differ from those responsible for
CD203c upregulation.

Treating CU is challenging, as many patients are refractory to the standard pharmacological
therapy. Omalizumab, a humanized anti-I[gE monoclonal antibody, has been approved for the
treatment of CU. During phase 3 trials, omalizumab was effective in 52% of CU patients
based on Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) of <6, but only 34% had complete clinical
response (UAS7 of 0)!. Given this modest response rate, the requirement to administer this
agent for up to 3 months before recognizing treatment failure, and the expense associated
with its use, the identification of biomarkers predicting responsiveness would prove
valuable. In the omalizumab CU clinical trials, the HRA was positive in only 25-30% of
subjects and had no value in predicting therapeutic response!. The greater specificity of the
CD203c assay for CU suggests it may have superior predictive value in determining
omalizumab responsiveness.

Therefore, we performed a retrospective chart review of 41 consecutive adult patients with
antihistamine-refractory CU seen at the University of Virginia outpatient allergy clinic
between 2011-2013 in order to investigate use of the basophil CD203c assay as a biomarker
of responsiveness to omalizumab in CU. This study was approved by the University of
Virginia Health System Institutional Review Board (IRB-HSR #18100). Basophil CD203cupregulating activity was obtained in all subjects prior to omalizumab administration
(National Jewish Health Advance Diagnostic Laboratories, Denver CO). Clinical response
was evaluated after a minimum of 3 months of treatment based upon patient’s and
physician’s subjective determination. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare basophil
CD203c-upregulating activity in responders and non-responders (GraphPad Prism 6.0) and
p<0.05 was considered significant.

Patients’ characteristics are summarized in Table-I. CD203c-upregulating activity was
present in 18/41 subjects (43.9%). Subjects were treated with omalizumab 300 mg SC
q4weeks for at least 3 months. Omalizumab was effective in 29/41 (71%) CU patients
overall, slightly higher that what has been reported in published studies!> 67.9. Of the 18
subjects demonstrating CD203c-upregulating activity, only 9 (50%) had clinical
improvement with omalizumab (Figure I). In contrast, of the 23 without CD203cupregulating activity, 20 (87%) had a clinical response to omalizumab (p=0.02, Fisher’s
exact test). Thus having a negative result predicts a much greater likelihood of responding to
omalizumab with the odds ratio of a negative test being 6.7 (95% Cl; 1.4-31) No correlation
of efficacy was found with age, sex, or the presence of thyroid autoantibodies (not shown).

Although not proven, basophil CD203c-upregulating activity is thought to reflect the
presence of autoantibodies to IgE and/or FceRIa suggesting that the presence of these
autoantibodies unexpectedly predicted a /ower likelihood of clinical response. Clearly, this
observation needs to be repeated in a prospective fashion, but if confirmed in those studies,
this holds promise as a clinically useful biomarker predicting response to treatment. The
mechanism of action of omalizumab in CU is not known and this understanding will
ultimately be central to predicting responders. Omalizumab binds to free IgE in the
circulation and therefore prevents IgE from binding to mast cells and basophils®. As the

binding of IgE is required to stabilize receptors on the cell surface, there is a secondary
robust reduction in FceRI expression on basophils after treatment with omalizumab’.
Therefore, one mechanism of action for omalizumab in CU may be through down-regulation
of the antigenic target of the autoantibodies.” However, in one — albeit modestly sized —
study this down-regulation of FceRI expression did not extend to mast cells, the presumed
source of disease in CU,° questioning the role for this mechanism in CU. This interpretation
is supported by the current study, as if this were the mechanism, it would be predicted that
those with CD203c-upregulating activity would be more likely to have responded.

We are therefore compelled to develop an alternative explanation for its mechanism of
action. One obvious consideration is the possibility that CU is in fact an IgE-mediated
“allergic” disease, and omalizumab is capturing free IgE that presumably is directed against
self-antigens. Interestingly, ~30-50% of CU patients have thyroiditis and in a previous study,
54.2% of CU patients were found to have IgE-anti-TPO present® suggesting one plausible
target for such IgE auto-antibodies. Further investigation is ongoing into the presence of IgE
auto-antibodies in CU patients and their utility as a biomarker in predicting efficacy of
omalizumab in CU.
