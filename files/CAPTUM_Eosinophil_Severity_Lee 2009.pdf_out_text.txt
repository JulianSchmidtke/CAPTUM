Cetirizine (Zyrtec) is a potent and long-acting second-generation
histamine H1- receptor antagonist for the treatment of allergic disease,
such as allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, in adult and
child. It is a racemic mixture of levocetirizine (Xyzal) and dextrocetirizine. The purpose of this present study was to compare the efficacy of
cetirizine, levocetirizine and placebo for the treatment of pediatric
perennial allergic rhinitis. 74 perennial allergic rhinitis patients, aged 6
to 12 years old, assigned to | of 3 treatment groups for 12 weeks randomly. The effects of the three agents were compared with the Pediatric
Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (PRQLQ) and Total
Symptom Score (TSS) by diary. Nasal peak expiratory flow rate
(nPEFR) and laboratory examinations including serum
immunoglobulin E level, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), blood
eosinophil counts and eosinophil percentage in a nasal smear were
evaluated among the three groups. The results revealed that both
cetirizine and levocetirizine improved TSS in comparison with the
placebo group, and ceterizine appeared to be more efficacious than
levocetirizine at week 8 and week 12. The PRQLQ score showed
significant decreased both in cetirizine and levocetirizine group, but
there was no statistic significant difference between both groups. The
eosinophil proportion in a nasal smear significantly decreased among
the cetirizine in comparison with the placebo group but there was no
statistic significant in levocetirizine groups. Both cetirizine and
levocetirizine showed significant improvement in nPEFR in comparison
with the placebo group, and ceterizine appeared to be more efficacious
than levocetirizine. The 12-week treatment program showed that
cetirizine was more effectious than levocetirizine.

Allergic rhinitis is a common childhood disease its
prevalence is increasing worldwide (1-3). The
disease is chronic and persists lifelong if untreated
and may result not only in loss of school days
for the child but also in lost productivity of parents
or caregivers, who may miss work. Treatment
should be effective in these young patients and
not adversely affect their activity and ability to
learn.

Studies evaluating newer antihistamines in
children are few. This study compares the efficacy
and safety of cetirizine and levocetirizine in
treating pediatric perennial allergic rhinitis in
children aged from 6 to 12.

in adults and children, respectively. It is a
racemic of equal parts of levocetirizine and
dextrocetirizine.

Levocetirizine (Xyzal) is a new-generation
selective H1-antihistamine approved for the
treatment of allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. Published studies have demonstrated its efficacy, safety, and anti-inflammatory
properties in treating perennial allergic rhinitis in
adults (4-7) and some studies have demonstrated
that the antihistaminergic activity of the racemic
is primarily due to levocetirizine (8-10). However, comparisons of cetirizine and levocetirizine
in children with allergic rhinitis are few.

Therefore, we designed this clinical trial to
compare the efficacy and safety of cetirizine and
levocetirizine for the treatment of pediatric
perennial allergic rhinitis.

Materials and methods
Participants

Eighty children aged from 6 to 12 yr fulfilled
the criteria for the study and they were with
moderate to severe perennial allergic rhinitis
[according to the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact
on Asthma (ARIA) classification] for at least
1 yr. All were allergic to the house dust mite,
which was confirmed by skin prick-test response
and a positive reaction to mite specific IgE
(Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Exclusion criteria were positive, response to other allergens or
deformities of the ear, nose, or throat or infection
during the 2 wk preceding the initial visit, or
having taken medicine which may have affected
any allergy symptoms such as antihistamine,
decongestant or any form of steroid within seven
days before the study. Participants were excluded
if they had a respiratory tract infection or took
the above medicine during the study period.
A washout of seven days was required for
patients taking leukotriene antagonist. The study
was approved by Chung Shan Medical University Hospital Institutional Review Board. Written parental informed consent was obtained
before commencing the study.

Study design

In the initial screening visit, a comprehensive
medical and allergy history was taken on all participants and they were administered skin prick
tests. Daily activity diaries were given to participants with the instructions to record all symptoms in the diary card every day from seven days
before treatment started. Medication history was

494

reviewed to ensure that participants had not used
an Hl-antagonist, decongestant or any form of
steroid during the preceding seven days.

Nasal peak expiratory flow rate (nPEFR) tests
and nasal smear examinations were performed
and patients requested to complete the Pediatric
Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaires (PRQLQ) at the baseline visit. The serum
eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) level, total IgE
level, and total eosinophil count were checked, and
the patients’ preceding seven-day activity diaries
reviewed. This was a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study. Participants were assigned to one of three treatment groups: 27
patients took cetirizine (10 mg daily), 26 patients
took levocetirizine (5 mg daily) and 27 patients
were given the placebo. The assigned medication
was taken once daily at bedtime for 12 wk after the
baseline visit. All patients were followed up every
4 wk during this period. A physical examination
and nPEFR were performed at each visit, and all
daily diary cards were collected.

At the final visit, the symptoms diaries were
reviewed and patients were requested to complete
the PRQLQ again. The nPEFR test and laboratory tests, including nasal smear, ECP, total
eosinophil count and total IgE level, were also
repeated.

 

Daily diary of nasal symptom score

Rhinitis symptoms were measured using a fourgrade scale, with scores ranging from 0 to 3 as
follows: 0, none (symptom not noticeable); 1, mild
(symptom noticeable but not bothersome); 2, moderate (symptom noticeable and bothersome some
of the time); and 3, severe (symptom bothersome
most of the time and/or very bothersome some of
the time). Four nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal
stuffiness/congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing)
and four non-nasal symptoms (eye itching/burning, eye tearing/watering, eye redness, itching of
ears/or palate) were recorded by the patients
themselves every day. Some younger age (around
6- or 7-yr old) children may record the symptoms
with the help of their parents. The Total Symptom
Score (TSS) was the sum of the eight recorded
symptom scores. Baseline TSS and each symptom
score was calculated as the mean of the daily scores
during the baseline period of seven days. Patients
were followed up at weeks 4, 8, and 12 after
treatment.

PROLO

The PRQLQ have 23 items in the five areas of
nasal symptoms, ocular symptoms, practical
Treatment of allergic rhinitis with cetirizine and levocetirizine

problems, other symptoms, and activity limitations. Each item is scored using a seven-point
scale from 0 to 6 (11). The questionnaire can be
completed within 5 min by children. Some younger aged children may record the score with the
help of their parents.

nPEFR

Nasal peak expiratory flow rate (nPEFR) was
performed with a Mini-Wright peak expiratory
flow meter equipped with a purpose-built face
mask, incorporating a good seal with the face,
placed on the patient during tests. Patients were
instructed to blow the nose forcefully after a deep
inspiration while sitting with their mouth firmly
closed. This test was performed three times and
the highest value recorded.

Nasal smear

The underside of the patient’s inferior turbinate
was rubbed with a cotton wool bud and then
smeared on a glass slide. The slides were stained
with Leu stain and examined with a light
microscope. An experienced cytologist, blinded
to the subjects’ clinical status, performed this
assay. The nasal smear was recorded by counting
a minimum of 100 leukocytes and the eosinophil
count expressed as a proportion of the total
number of leukocytes.

Assessment of safety

The investigators physically examined the subjects at each visit and assessed safety and
tolerability for each treatment group. All adverse
events and any change of vital signs were
recorded.

Statistical analysis

Analyses were made using spss/pc 12.0 software
(SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All collected
data were expressed as a mean + s.d. One-way
analysis of variance was used to compare demographics and baseline characteristics among the
three groups. A p value less than 0.05 was
considered to be significant.

 

Results

Of the eighty patients initially entered into the
study, 74 completed the study. Twenty-six
patients were assigned to the cetirizine group
(10 mg daily), 24 to the levocetirizine group
(5 mg daily) and 24 to the placebo group. Six of

the original 80 patients were excluded from the
study because their TSS recordings had not been
completed during the treatment period (one in
the cetirizine group; two in the levocetirizine
group; and three in the placebo group). There
were no significant differences in baseline demographics and health characteristics among the

Both cetirizine and levocetirizine significantly
reduced TSS scores compared with the placebo
group at weeks 4, 8, 12 (p < 0.005). Compared
with levocetirizine, cetirizine appeared to be

than levocetirizine, especially nasal congestion.
Cetirizine significantly improved the nPEFR
value compared with the placebo group at weeks
4, 8 and 12 (p < 0.001). Levocetirizine significantly improved the nPEFR value compared
with the placebo group for weeks 8 and 12
(p < 0.05). Comparing the two treatments,
cetirizine appeared to be more efficacious than

levocetirizine at weeks 8 and 12 (p < 0.05)
(Table 2, Fig. 2).

Both cetirizine and levocetirizine significantly
lowered the mean PRQLQ values compared with
the placebo group after the three-month treatment (p < 0.05). There was no statistically
significant difference in comparing both drugs
(p = 0.095) (Table 2, Fig. 3).

In nasal smears, cetirizine proved to significantly reduce the eosinophil proportion of cells
post-treatment over the pre-treatment level
(p < 0.001). This result suggests that recruitment of eosinophils in the nasal mucosa is
inhibited after cetirizine treatment (Table 2).

In laboratory tests, cetirizine significantly
decreased the total eosinophil count in peripheral
blood after the 12-wk period treatment
(p < 0.05) but levocetirizine did not show the
same effect. Levocetirizine significantly reduced
ECP after the 12-wk treatment (p < 0.001) but
cetirizine did not show the same effect. The three
groups showed no significant change in IgE levels
after treatment.

Mild sedation in one patient treated with
cetirizine, mild fatigue in levocetirizine was
recorded during treatment. There were no serious
adverse events noted.

Discussion

Oral antihistamines are the mainstay treatment
for allergies in adults and children. Children,
especially those of school age, need less sedative
potential to mitigate the negative effects on
daytime alertness and leaning. First-generation
antihistamines are associated with side effects
such as sedation, dry mouth, and impaired
psychomotor activity. Newer, second-generation
antihistamines, such as cetirizine, loratadine,
fexofenadine and levocetirizine, act quickly and
exhibit fewer sedative and anticholinergic effects
(5, 12-14).

We previously compared the efficacy of cetirizine, oxatomide, ketotifen and placebo in children aged 6 to 12 with perennial allergic rhinitis
(15). Cetirizine was more efficacious in the
control of PAR symptoms. In 2004 and 2006,
we published our studies comparing the efficacy
and safety of cetirizine and montelukast in
children aged 6-12 yr (16) and 2-6 yr (17) with
perennial allergic rhinitis. Cetirizine was more
efficacious than montelukast in both groups. In
the present comparison, cetirizine was superior to
levocetirizine.

Most clinical trials have shown that cetirizine
and levocetirizine are potent antihistamines that
can relieve symptoms of allergic disorder (4-10).

497
Lee et al.

However, clinical trials comparing cetirizine and
levocetirizine in children with perennial allergic
rhinitis are few.

In 2005, Potter published a 4-wk clinical trial
of the efficacy and safety of levocetirizine and
health-related quality of life in children aged
6-12 yr with perennial allergic rhinitis (4).
In his study, levocetirizine showed a significant
improvement in 2- and 4-wk total four
symptom scores compared with a_ placebo.
The first 2 wk showed the biggest difference
between levocetirizine and placebo. However,
in the PRQLQ, there was no significant difference between levocetirizine and placebo in week
4.

In 2005, de Blic et al. published a 6-wk clinical
trial of the efficacy and safety of levocetirizine in
children aged 6 to 12 yr with seasonal allergic
rhinitis (18). The effect of levocetirizine was
statistically superior to the placebo and nasal
congestion improved, as in our study.

Since cetirizine consists of 5 mg of levocetirizine and 5 mg dextrocetirizine, it would be
beneficial to know the relative merits of these
two elements. Several clinical trials have revealed
that the antihistaminic properties of cetirizine are
likely to be attributable to levocetirizine (8-10).
If the efficacy of levocetirizine could be as good
as cetirizine, the patient could dispense with
taking an unnecessary drug. However, our 12-wk
treatment program showed that cetirizine was
more efficacious than levocetirizine, whether
comparing total symptom score, PRQLQ score
or nasal peak expiratory flow rate improvement.

Various individual factors would influence the
absorption, distribution and metabolism of medicine. Race, genetic factors or age may influence
the amount of histamine receptor in a human
and receptor maturation and expression may also
differ. Different ages may have different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. In
Canada, Simons, on behalf of the ETAC study
group, reported an 18-month study of very
young children aged 14-46 months (19). In this
study, levocetirizine was well absorbed after oral
administration, clearance rates were similar to or
faster than in adults, and terminal elimination
half-life values were similar to or shorter than in
adults. These researchers recommended basing
levocetirizine dosing in very young children on
body weight and age, and suggested that twice
daily dosing or relatively higher doses may be
necessary. Both their and our studies suggest that
population pharmacokinetic studies of levocetirizine are needed in children to determine optimal
dosing. A 2005 Australian study by Cranswick
examined the pharmacokinesis of levocetirizine

498

(20). This study revealed that twice daily dosing
using 0.125 mg/kg levocetirizine was adequate
pharmacokinetically and pharmacodynamically,
and produced a good safety profile in 1- to 2-yrold children. From these reports we wonder if
twice daily use of levocetirizine may have a better
effect on perennial allergic rhinitis in children 6
to 12. We will need larger and long-term studies
to make this judgment.

Simons, on behalf of the ETAC (Early Treatment of the Atopic Child) study group, recently
reported the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of levocetirizine in children ages 6 to
11 yr (21). He demonstrated that levocetirizine
was highly selective for human histamine H1receptor and has twice the binding affinity of
cetirizine. The study concluded that once-daily
dosing may be optimal in children of this age
group. However, the study used histamineinduced wheal-and-flare bioassay to evaluate
the onset, amount, and duration of activity of
Hl-antihistamine. As the author mentioned,
whether skin test suppression correlates with
events in the airways remains controversial.

Cotton swabs were commonly used to collect
nasal smear specimens. It is simple and inexpensive, but false-positive and false-negative results
are common. It may have been better and yielded
more accurate results, if nasal smears had been
taken with a rhinoprobe than with a cotton tip.

No serious adverse events were recorded for
either cetirizine or levocetirizine. The principle
pharmacological effects of cetirizine (Zyrtec) are
mediated through selective inhibition of peripheral histamine H1-receptors. The use of cetirizine is associated with a low incidence of
anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth. It
causes little sedation and has no cardiac adverse
effects, unlike highly lipophilic antihistamine
(22-25).

In conclusion, our 12-wk treatment program
showed that cetirizine was more efficacious
than levocetirizine. Twice daily for oral intake
of levocetirizine may be an alternative way to
well control the symptoms of perennial allergic
rhinitis in age 6- to 12-yr-old children. There
was no serious adverse event recorded for
either cetirizine or levocetirizine. We may need
larger, longer and extended studies to assess the
conclusion.
