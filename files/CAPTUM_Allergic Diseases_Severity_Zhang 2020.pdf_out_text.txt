Abstract

Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been widely spread. We aim
to investigate the clinical characteristic and allergy status of patients infected with
SARS-CoV-2.

Methods: Electronic medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation,
comorbidities, laboratory data, and radiological materials of 140 hospitalized COVID19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, were extracted and
analyzed.

Results: An approximately 1:1 ratio of male (50.7%) and female COVID-19 patients
was found, with an overall median age of 57.0 years. All patients were communityacquired cases. Fever (91.7%), cough (75.0%), fatigue (75.0%), and gastrointestinal
symptoms (39.6%) were the most common clinical manifestations, whereas hypertension (30.0%) and diabetes mellitus (12.1%) were the most common comorbidities. Drug hypersensitivity (11.4%) and urticaria (1.4%) were self-reported by several
patients. Asthma or other allergic diseases were not reported by any of the patients.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 1.4%) patients and current smokers
(1.4%) were rare. Bilateral ground-glass or patchy opacity (89.6%) was the most common sign of radiological finding. lymphopenia (75.4%) and eosinopenia (52.9%) were
observed in most patients. Blood eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe (r = .486, P < .001) and nonsevere (r = .469, P < .001) patients
after hospital admission. Significantly higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein,
and procalcitonin were associated with severe patients compared to nonsevere patients (all P < .001).

Conclusion: Detailed clinical investigation of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 cases suggests eosinopenia together with lymphopenia may be a potential indicator for diagnosis. Allergic diseases, asthma, and COPD are not risk factors for SARS-CoV-2
infection. Older age, high number of comorbidities, and more prominent laboratory

abnormalities were associated with severe patients.

1 | INTRODUCTION

A novel member of human coronavirus, newly identified in
Wuhan, China, recently, now officially named as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) by International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) is a new strain of RNA
viruses that has not been previously identified in humans. Studies
have shown that the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, recently
named as COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) by World Health
Organization (WHO), could induce symptoms including fever, dry
cough, dyspnea, fatigue, and lymphopenia in infected patients. In
more severe cases, infections causing viral pneumonia may lead
to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and even death.**
Since the first report of COVID-19 in December 2019 in Wuhan,
China, the outbreak of the disease is currently continuously evolving. Until February 16, 2020, the locations with confirmed SARSCoV-2 cases include 25 countries. Globally, 73 332 cases were
confirmed, including 72 528 cases in China and 804 cases outside of China.° A total of 1870 patients have died from this viral
infection.°

It was established that the SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta-coronavirus 2b lineage in the phylogenetic tree. By examining
the full-length genome of SARS-CoV-2, it was discovered that this
novel virus shared 87.99% identity sequencing with the bat SARSlike coronavirus,° and it shared ~80% identity nucleotide with the
original SARS epidemic virus.’ Based on the preliminary information
of this novel virus, it is considered that SARS-CoV-2 is the third zoonotic human coronavirus of the century.® In addition, clinical evidences have suggested that this virus is transmissible from person to
person.”?° Currently, it is still unclear about the origins and possible
intermediate animal vectors of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the mechanism of this virus, that is, spreading between persons.

Despite that many articles have established the clinical features of COVID-19 patients so far,** the allergy aspects and the
information of the allergic disease-related laboratory findings of
these patients have not been reported yet. Previous studies have
discussed the possible relationship between viral infections, immune response, and allergy and asthma. Several types of viruses,
such as rhinovirus (RVs) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), were

the main focus of research,!**°

whereas for coronavirus, and particularly COVID-19, there is no report in this context. It is generally
established that allergy may increase the risk of virus-induced exacerbation of allergic diseases, such as asthma.'®*” Genetic predisposition, deficient antiviral response, impairment of immune
cell function, damage of epithelium, and cytokine and chemokine
response may contribute to the synergistical promotion of allergic
disease exacerbation by allergen and virus, especially for respiratory tract allergy.®?° However, according to the hygiene hypothesis in the allergy field, respiratory infections during early life may

play a protective role against the Th2-mediated allergic disease
development.**

The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) in people 240 years old was 13.7% in China according to a
recent study.?? Respiratory tract virus infection is a common trigger
for acute exacerbation of COPD.”° The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2
infection in COPD patients is not clear. In addition, the influence
of smoking behavior on the susceptibility to this virus has not been
investigated.

This research aims to investigate the clinical and laboratory characteristic of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, including differences
between severe and nonsevere patients, and to reveal the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection, immune response, allergy, and
clinical manifestations, with a special focus on asthma, COPD, and

smoking behavior.

2 | METHODS
2.1 | Patients’ involvement and data collection

All hospitalized patients (n = 242) (admission date from January
16 to February 3, 2020) in No. 7 Hospital of Wuhan, clinically diagnosed as “viral pneumonia” based on their clinical symptoms
(fever or respiratory symptoms) with typical changes in chest radiology, were preliminarily involved in this study. No. 7 Hospital of
Wuhan is one of the designated hospitals for the hospitalization
of patients with COVID-19 and has been entrusted by Zhongnan
Hospital of Wuhan University since January 2020. The pharyngeal swab specimens of these patients were collected and used for
SARS-CoV-2 detection. Patients absent of or with negative SARSCoV-2 test results were excluded from this study. All patients
involved in this study were living in Wuhan during the outbreak
period of COVID-19.

Demographic information, clinical characteristics (included medical history, exposure history, comorbidities, surgery history, signs,
and symptoms), chest computed tomographic (CT) scan or X-ray results, and laboratory findings of each patient were obtained from the
electronic medical record system of No. 7 Hospital of Wuhan and
analyzed by three independent researchers. The access was granted
by the director of the hospital. Patients with smoking history, COPD,
and allergic diseases (including asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergy, atopic dermatitis, and urticaria) were identified. For patients
with smoking history, the amount of smoking, the years of smoking
history, and the years of smoking cessation were individually collected. This study was approved by the institutional ethics board of
Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (No. 2020028).

The date of disease onset and hospital admission date, as well
as the severity of COVID-19, were also recorded. The onset date
ZHANG er AL.

 

 

 

was defined as the day when any symptoms were noticed by the
patients. Severity of COVID-19 was defined according to the diagnostic and treatment guideline for SARS-CoV-2 issued by Chinese
National Health Committee (version 3-5). Severe COVID-19 was
designated when the patients had one of the following criteria: (a)
respiratory distress with respiratory frequency 230/min; (b) pulse
oximeter oxygen saturation <93% at rest; and (c) oxygenation index
(artery partial pressure of oxygen/inspired oxygen fraction, PaO,/
FiO.) < 300 mm Hg.

2.2 | Laboratory testing

Patient pharyngeal swab specimens were collected for the SARSCoV-2 viral nucleic acid detection using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The viral
nucleic acid testing for all patients was performed by the clinical
laboratory from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan,
which is the designated laboratory for SARS-CoV-2 test for patients
in No. 7 Hospital of Wuhan. Detailed protocol was described somewhere else.°

Medical laboratory finding results, including the numbers of
leukocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils; percentages of lymphocyte and eosinophils; concentrations of D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), serum amyloid A (SAA), and serum
creatine kinase; and detection of different pathogens (including
Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, influenza A
virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza, Coxsackie virus group B,
adenovirus, echovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Epstein-Barr
virus, and cytomegalovirus), were collected for each patient. All
medical laboratory data were generated by the clinical laboratory
of No. 7 Hospital of Wuhan. As disease progressed, the most updated secondary results for laboratory findings (included numbers
and percentages of lymphocytes and eosinophils) during the hospital stay were also collected. The laboratory data for some patients were missing due to the absence of types of tests or delayed

results.

2.3 | Statistical analysis

Categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables were described using median
and interquartile ranges (IQR) values. To compare the continuous
variables for data of different patient groups, two-tailed t test and
Mann-Whitney test were used as appropriate. The frequencies
of categorical variables were compared using the chi-square and
Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Spearman's correlation test was
used for calculation of correlation between different cell types.
All statistical analyses and graphs were generated and plotted
using GraphPad Prism version 7.00 software (GraphPad Software
Inc). The tests with P value of <.05 were considered statistically

significant.

3.1 | Demographics and clinical characteristics

A total of 140 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 were included in
this study, with 82 patients categorized into nonsevere patients
and 58 severe cases on admission. The median age for all patients
was 57 years, ranging from 25 to 87 years old, and the majority
(70%) of them were more than 50 years old. About half (50.7%)
of patients were male. Since no patients had direct exposure history of Huanan wet markets or wildlife animals, we presumed all
patients in this study were community-infected cases. The SARSCoV-2 clustered within 15 (10.7%) patients in this study, whose
family members or friends were also infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Three hospital workers were infected. Ninety (64.3%) patients had
at least one underlying comorbidity, the most common of which
were chronic diseases, such as hypertension (30%) and diabetes
(12.1%). Only two COPD patients were identified. Sixteen patients
had self-reported medical history of drug hypersensitivity, and
drug types include penicillin, cephalosporins, and specific Chinese
traditional medicines. Two patients reported chronic urticaria. No
self-reported other allergic diseases (including asthma, allergic
rhinitis, food allergy, atopic dermatitis, and other type 2 allergic
diseases) were declared. Thirty-eight (27.1%) patients had surgery
experience(s), such as C-section, cholecystectomy, and appendectomy. Interestingly, there were only 2 current smokers and 7 past
smokers (Table 1).

Symptoms of the patients on admission are shown in Table 2.
The median interval from the onset of symptoms to hospital admission for all patients was 8 days (IQR, 6-11). The most commonly
experienced symptoms were fever (91.7%), followed by cough
(75%), fatigue (75%), and chest tightness or dyspnea (36.7%).
39.6% of them complained about gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, diarrhea, poor appetite, abdominal pain, belching,

and emesis.

3.2 | Radiological and laboratory findings

Of the 135 patients with chest CT scan on admission, the majority (134, 99.3%) had abnormal results, showing typical images
that were bilateral multiple ground-glass opacities or consolidation (Table 2, Figures 1-3). The blood cell test result of patients
on the day of hospital admission showed normal leukocytes in
most of the patients (68.1%), with 12.3% increased and 19.6%
decreased numbers. Lymphopenia was common in 75.4% of the
patients (Table 3). Interestingly, more than half of these patients
(52.9%) had eosinopenia (eosinophil counts < 0.02 x 10°/L). Other
laboratory findings included higher concentration of C-reactive
protein (91.9%), serum amyloid A (90.2%), and D-dimer (43.2%),
while increased concentration of serum procalcitonin (34.7%) and
creatine kinase (6.7%) was relatively less common in all patients.

3.3 | Characteristics of severe cases

Severity was established based on respiratory functions on admission
with one of the below criteria: respiratory frequency 2 30/min, oxygen saturation < 93% at rest, and oxygenation index < 300 mm Hg
(see methods). Median age was 64 years in severe cases, compared
to 51.5 years in nonsevere cases (P < .001). More comorbidities
(79.3% vs 53.7%, P = .002), higher median values of leukocyte count
(5.3 vs 4.5, P = .014), D-dimer (0.4 vs 0.2, P < .001), CRP (47.6 vs
28.7, P < .001), PCT (0.1 vs 0.05, P < .001), and lower lymphocyte
percentage (median, 0.7 vs 0.8, P = .048) were found in severe cases,
compared to nonsevere cases. No difference was identified for the
occurrence rates of most signs and symptoms between nonsevere
and severe patients, and only two symptoms (cough and nausea)
were more commonly experienced in severe group (P = .023 and
0.027, respectively). Increased leukocyte number (P = .003), D-dimer
(P = .004), and PCT (P = .004) were more commonly observed in
severe patients (Tables 1-3).

3.4 | Correlation between blood eosinophil and
lymphocyte counts

The absolute numbers of circulating eosinophils correlated positively with the numbers of lymphocytes for all 138 patients, both for
the tests on the first day after hospital admission (r = .321, P < .001)

and for the secondary tests on 3 or more days afterward (r = .479,
P < .001). Same correlation was also found between the two cell
types, when patients were separated to severe (r = .250, P = .066
and r = .486, P < .001, respectively) and nonsevere groups (r = .369,
P< 001 andr = .469, P < .001, respectively) (Figure 4). Although no
significant correlations between the two cell types could be determined for the severe patients on the first day after hospital admission (r = .250, P = .066), this may be due to the extremely low values
of eosinophils for the severe patients on that day.

4 | DISCUSSION

In this study including 140 community-infected COVID-19 patients,
we found that most patients were middle- and old-aged, with almost
1:1 male-female ratio. Fever (91.7%), cough (75.0%), and fatigue
(75.0%) were the most common symptoms in COVID-19 patients.
More than 1/3 of the patients had chest tightness or dyspnea and
gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, and anorexia.
Radiologically, CT scan or X-ray showed bilateral ground-glass and
patchy opacity in 89.6% patients. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 was
confirmed by RT-PCR in all patients, and other pathogens were
rarely identified in these patients.

The median age of all patients was 57 years old, which is
close to the data reported by Wang et al® (56.0 years) and Chen
et al’ (55.5 years), but older than that reported by Huang et al*

and cardiovascular diseases were the most common underlying
diseases, consistent with other recent reports.?° The prevalence
of hypertension and diabetes in China was 23.2%** and 10.9%°
in adults, which was slightly lower than the data in this study; this
may be due to the large ratio of elder COVID-19 patients in the
series. In general, aged people are more susceptible to COVID-19
and more likely to be severe than people younger than 50 years;
this may be due to more health issues and comorbidities in this

population.

In the present study, 50.7% of the patients were male; the percentage is lower than that reported by Huang et al* and Chen et al?
with a male predominance (73.0%), but similar to that reported by
Wang et al? (54.3%). This may be related to the occupational risk
factors for men in wet market, considering that 66.0% patients in
Huang's report and 49% patients in Chen's report had Huanan wet
market exposure history. No patient in our report had a history of
Huanan wet market exposure, indicating the cause of community
infection of SARS-CoV-2; therefore, the female-male ratio tends

to be approximately 1:1. This is lower than that observed in SARS
coronavirus-infected patients, which had a female predominance
(61.0%).?° In addition, there was no difference in the female-male
ratio in severe patients.

No asthmatic patient was identified in this report, and only a
few patients had self-reported drug hypersensitivity and urticaria.
Other allergies such as allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and food
allergy were not reported. Given the prevalence of asthma in China
was 4.2%?” and allergic rhinitis in Wuhan was 9.7%° in adults,
asthma or allergy may not be the risk factor for the SARS-CoV-2
infection. Many previous studies have investigated the association
between virus infection and asthma, showing that respiratory tract
viral infections are associated with asthma exacerbations. About
62%-95% of children with acute wheezing episodes tested positive
for respiratory viruses in both hospital and community settings;
while the prevalence in adults was less, it was still in the range of
41%-78%.2? Rhinoviruses (RVs) were the most frequently detected
type of virus at all ages, whose infection could lead to more severe
and longer-lasting lower respiratory tract symptoms. Virus-induced
wheezing in infancy was often associated with asthma development
in children.°° In addition to RV, other respiratory tract viruses, such
as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses (IfVs), coronaviruses (CoVs), human metapneumoviruses (HMPV5), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), adenoviruses (AdVs), and bocaviruses (BoVs),
had all been detected in subjects with asthma exacerbations.7°
Nevertheless, findings about the association between asthma and
coronaviruses were much less. CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E transmitted primarily during winter had been linked to asthma exacerbations in children and adults.°° In a literature systemic review

with 63 studies included, the pooled prevalence of CoV infection

 

2lwitey2

during asthma exacerbations was 8.4% (95% Cl, 5.1%-13.6%), ranking below RV (42.1%, the highest), RSV, herpes simplex virus (HSV),
enterovirus (EnV), and IfV, and followed by cytomegalovirus (CV),

Allergy

 

 

 

BoV, PIV, metapneumovirus (MpV), and AdV. In Asia, the five major
viruses associated with asthma were RV, EnV, IfV, PIV, and RSV.°4
Reported respiratory infection rates for CoV in children were usually from <1% to 9%, which varied between subtypes. In case-control studies, CoV was not more frequently presented in wheezing
children in comparison with controls. Overall, CoV seemed to have
a minor, if any, contribution to acute asthma exacerbations, and
CoV infections were frequently co-infected with other viruses.2? As
for the other two types of CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV which
could cause severe respiratory disease in human, most established
studies with animal models were found less relevant to asthma.°*
Intriguingly, a prospective clinical birth cohort study demonstrated
that the number of early respiratory episodes was related to the risk
of later development of asthma, irrespective of the virus type (eg,
RV, RSV, and CoV), which indicated the specific viral trigger may not
be a risk factor.°°

On the other hand, it is also worth thinking whether allergic diseases could affect respiratory virus infections. A multicenter prospective study°* examined the effects of the presence of atopy,
which was defined as positive skin prick tests to one or more allergens, on the course of disease in children hospitalized with viral
pneumonia. In that study, atopy was found in 21.4% patients, while
it showed there was no effect of atopic sensitization on the severity
of viral pneumonia in children. In addition, pollen, type 2 response,
respiratory viruses, and the tissue milieu such as the type 2 or type
1 may all affect the development and severity of viral infections.1°*”
Also, history of allergic diseases such as ever wheezing, atopic dermatitis, and food/drug allergy was associated with severe pneumonia.°* Taken together, virus infections have been associated with
acute exacerbation of asthma, and allergy may not be a risk factor
for virus infection. It is plausible that this concept may also apply to
SARS-CoV-2; however, having no asthma patients and no respiratory
allergies does not support this concept at least in this series of 140
patients.

Two (1.4%) patients had COPD in our report; the percentage is
similar as that reported by Guan et al* (12/1099, 1.1%). In addition,
only 9 (6.4%) patients had a history of smoking, and 7 of them
were past smokers. It was reported that the prevalence of COPD
in adults 240 years old was 13.7%,”? and 27.3% of adults in China

were current cigarette smokers (data in 2018).°°

The relationship
between smoking and coronavirus infection is not clear, and the
exact underlying causes of the lower incidence of COVID-19 in
current smokers are still unknown. Previous study demonstrated
that CoV was not frequently detected by RT-PCR in the exacerbation of COPD, as compared to other respiratory viruses such as RV,
EnV, RSV, and IfV, indicating that coronavirus plays a minor role
in the acute exacerbation of COPD.”° Although our study found
that COPD and smoking populations were less likely to be infected
with SARS-CoV-2, but the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in

smokers may be more severe.

Smokers and COPD patients are more susceptible to the infection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
Arecent study found that dipeptidy! peptidase IV (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, had a higher expression in smokers and COPD
patients than in nonsmokers. In addition, the expression of DPP4
was inversely correlated with lung function and diffusing capacity
parameters.°°

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is abundantly expressed in airway epithelial cells and was identified as a receptor for
SARS-CoV, which plays a crucial role in SARS-CoV-induced lung injury.°” ACE2 and other components of renin-angiotensin system are
the core factors for the control of acute lung injury induced by SARS
coronavirus. In vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that ACE2 expression was downregulated once the disease process has been initiated.°® Thus, ACE2 may have double effects on SARS-induced lung
injury.°? Initially, it acts as a receptor for the infection of SARS coronavirus, and then, its downregulation promotes lung injury. ACE2
was also identified as the receptor for the novel SARS-CoV-2.*° The
role of ACE2 in the pathogenesis of this new coronavirus-induced

lung injury is still unknown. Therefore, further studies are required

EOS counts

to examine the expression of ACE2 in airway epithelia from COPD
patients and current smokers.

No significant difference was identified between the severe
(7 days) and nonsevere patients (8 days), regarding the median days
from symptom onset to hospital admission. Almost all patients
(91.7%) had fever at onset of symptoms, consistent with that reported by Huang? and Wang,’ but much higher than that reported by
Guan.* However, in Guan's study,* most patients (87.9%) developed
fever during hospitalization. Therefore, fever was the most common
symptom in patients with COVID-19. Cough was another common
symptom in these patients. 75% patients in our report had cough; the
number is similar as that reported by other studies.‘* The incidence
of fatigue in this study was 75%, which is higher than that reported by
Huang and Guan, but close to that reported by Wang. The incidence
of gastrointestinal symptoms was 39.6% in our report, which is much
higher than that reported by Huang and Guan, but similar as Wang's
study. Radiologically, most common signs on CT scan were bilateral
ground-glass or patchy opacity.’ This is consistent with what we observed in our report (Figures 1-3). The distribution of the opacity in

the lung was not different between severe and nonsevere patients.
ZHANG er AL.

 

Lymphopenia was common in patients of our study (75.4%); this
is consistent with other reports.°* Noticeably, the percentages, but
not absolute counts of lymphocytes, were lower in severe patients
when compared to nonsevere patients. This may be due to the increased total numbers of leukocytes in severe patients.

Interestingly, decreased eosinophil counts were also common
in these patients (52.9%). No significant difference in the ratio of
patients with decreased eosinophil counts between severe and
nonsevere patients was identified. There was a positive correlation between eosinophil and lymphocytes numbers, especially for
the second test during hospitalization. Therefore, decreased eosinophil count may be used as an indicator of SARS-CoV-2 infection
in suspected patients. In those patients with typical symptoms and
radiological changes with and without lymphopenia, decreased eosinophils may be an important diagnostic clue.

Other abnormal laboratory findings include increased level of
serum CRP, SAA, PCT, D-dimer, and creatine kinase, indicating sustained inflammatory response and disturbed coagulation mechanism
after infection with SARS-CoV-2. In addition, CRP, PCT, D-dimer
concentration, and leukocyte counts were significantly higher in severe compared to nonsevere patients, which may represent more
prominent inflammation in severe patients. Higher leukocyte count
and PCT may also be due to secondary bacterial infection. More precautions should be taken in patients with high serum CK, which may
be caused by direct effect of virus or indirect effect of hypoxia. In
the present study, data in regard to the treatment and outcome of
these patients were not finalized, since most of these patients are
remaining hospitalized.

In summary, the study established the clinical and laboratory
characteristics of 140 community-infected COVID-19 patients,
showing an approximately 1:1 female-male ratio. Low prevalence
of smokers and no allergic diseases despite of drug hypersensitivity
and urticaria was self-reported by any patients, indicating that allergic diseases and smoking history may not be the susceptible factors
for COVID-19. The positive correlation of blood eosinophil and lymphocyte counts suggests that eosinopenia along with lymphopenia
may be a useful indicator for diagnosing COVID-19 in those patients
with typical symptoms and radiological changes. Larger sample population is needed to further investigate the relationship between
SARS-CoV-2 infection and allergic diseases.
