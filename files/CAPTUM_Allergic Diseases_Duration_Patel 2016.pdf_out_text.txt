chronic urticaria

Clinical Implications

e Elevated urinary N-methyl histamine relates to the
occurrence of angioedema in chronic urticaria and

shorter duration of disease at presentation. Predictive
algorithms using this easily measureable biomarker may
help in prognosis.

 

TO THE EDITOR:

Chronic urticaria (CU) defined as hives lasting more than 6
weeks’ is a challenging disease to treat due to its unpredictable
nature, the lack of prognostic predictors, and minimal data on
predictors of treatment response. CU affects between 0.5% and
5% of the population with the estimated incidence rate of 1.4%
per year.’ Quality of life of patients with CU is significantly
poor” with associated angioedema (in approximately 40% of
cases) perceived as a particularly alarming symptom. Hives
commonly last 3-5 years with 85% of patients reporting resolution of urticaria within 5 years.’

Clinical predictors of CU include coexisting angioedema,
disease severity, and positivity to an autologous serum test
associated with a longer duration of disease.’ Poor control with
an H1 antihistamine was reported with dermatographism, a
physical urticaria, and neutrophilic infiltrates on skin biopsy,
whereas the presence of thyroid autoantibodies predicted greater
control.” Recent data are emerging on the role of biomarkers as
prognosticators of disease; we retrospectively sought to
investigate whether urinary N-methyl histamine (uNMH)
could be associated with disease duration and presence of
angioedema.

This was a 2-year retrospective study of patients seen at an
adult tertiary outpatient allergy clinic (2013-2015). Data on
patient demographics, clinical symptoms, medical history,
family history, basic laboratory evaluation, and medication use
were collected. Of 75 patients screened, 10 patients were
excluded for an unknown duration of urticaria or urticaria <6
weeks. Of the 65 patients, 32 patients had clinical impression
of chronic idiopathic urticaria, had no additional workup
performed, and were not included in analysis. The remainder
(n = 33) had symptoms suggestive of a mast cell activation
(eg, palpitations, diarrhea, episodes of light headedness or
dizziness, etc.) and therefore underwent further assessment
including serum tryptase and 24-hour uNMH. One patient
had serum tryptase >20 ng/mL and was excluded; thus the
final number for analysis was 32. Thus patients with CU who
underwent 24-hour uNMH and serum tryptase measurement
as part of assessment for mast cell activation but resulted
normal were analyzed. This study was approved by the

Table I shows the characteristics of the study population.
The median duration of hives was 46 weeks (interquartile range
[IQR] 16-180). The median blood eosinophil, basophil, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), tryptase level, and 24-hour
uNMH_ level were within normal limits. The 24-hour
uNMH levels inversely correlated with duration of urticaria at
the time of presentation (Figure 1, R = —0.5, P = .003). Patients with angioedema had higher but normal uNMH (median
135 mcg/g Cr, IQR 113-157.5) compared with those without
angioedema (median 75.5 mcg/g Cr, IQR 58-119.5; P = .03)
(Figure 1). Serum tryptase did not exhibit such relation. We
found no association between uNMH and body mass index,
age, gender, severity of urticaria (as reflected by urticaria
affecting quality of sleep), autoimmune disease, thyroid disease,
or association with a physical trigger. Patients with abdominal
cramping as a symptom with CU tended to have higher uNMH
(median 150.5 meg/g Cr, IQR 135.5-182.7) than those
without (median 124.5, IQR 98.2-157.7) but did not reach
significance (P = .13). There was no correlation between
uNMH and peripheral eosinophil or basophil count, TSH, or
thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody titers. To analyze medication use and its relation to variables in the study, we classified
the medication use by applying a “medication scoring” system
to convert the heterogeneous textual data to a numeric scale
(Table I). There was a moderate and significant increase in the
intensity of the medication use with longer lasting urticaria
corresponding with greater medication use (R = 0.36, P= .04).
However, in this cohort, the medication score had a weak and
insignificant correlation (R = 0.174, P = .34) with the uNMH
excretion.

Higher N-methyl histamine excretion has been reported in
aspirin and food additive challenge in patients with CU® as well
as variation in methyl histamine excretion noted in relation to
timing of onset of challenge-induced hives.’ We sought to
examine if uNMH, a metabolite of histamine, could reflect the
clinical features of disease severity or duration. We found that
elevated uNMH relates to the occurrence of angioedema in CU
and shorter duration of disease at presentation. We recognize
some limitations of this analysis. First, our cohort was small and

may not be sufficiently powered to delineate differences between
other variables. Second, we were unable to factor the exact role of
medications on histamine excretion. Future studies would be
needed to investigate the relationship of higher urinary histamine
and response to increased antihistamines or if uNMH could
be used as a marker of medication-induced suppression. Third,
the study was retrospective and hence limited by the shortcomings of such design, and serial testing to conclusively rule out an
underlying mast cell-related condition was not available.
However, the study has its strengths. For example, clinical data
were obtained prospectively using a standard questionnaire tool
allowing for harmonization and consistent comparisons. To our
knowledge, this is the first comprehensive evaluation of 24-hour
uNMH, an easily obtainable marker, with broad clinical correlates in CU. Whether the reduced excretion with duration
reflects a change in histamine-based responses in long-term CU
needs to be further elucidated. Patients with CU and angioedema
had higher levels of UNMH excretion though uNMH levels were
still within the normal range for both groups. This suggests that
increased urinary histamine excretion may be a predictor of
short duration of CU and tendency for the development of
angioedema; though larger prospective studies are needed in this
regard.
