Background: The reported prevalences of IgG autoantibodies (AAbs) to FceRIa and IgE in sera from patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) have varied, and these AAbs are also often observed in
healthy control subjects. Regarding the histamine release activity of purified IgG from patients with CSU,
the number of examined patients has been small. Thus, we sought to determine the prevalence and FceRI
crosslinking ability of these AAbs in a large number of patients with CSU and non-atopic control (NC)
subjects.
Methods: We compared the concentrations of anti-IgE and anti-FceRla AAbs and the abilities of these
AAbs to cause FceRI aggregation in patients with CSU (n = 134) and NC subjects (n = 55) using ELISA and
an in vitro elicitation test, respectively.
Results: The concentration of anti-IgE AAbs was significantly different between the NC subjects and the
CSU patients (P < 0.0001, cutoff value: 0.558 j1g/mL), whereas the concentration of anti-FceRIa AAbs was
not. A significant difference in the duration of illness was noted between patients with lower and those
with higher concentrations of anti-IgE AAbs relative to the cutoff value. The abilities of anti-IgE AAbs, but
not anti-FceRIa AAbs, to induce FceRI crosslinking were significantly higher in CSU patients than in NC
subjects (P = 0.0106).
Conclusions: In the Japanese population of CSU patients studied, the ability of the anti-IgE AAbs to induce
FceRI crosslinking differed significantly between NC subjects and CSU patients, suggesting the involvement of anti-IgE AAbs in the pathogenesis of CSU in the Japanese population.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is defined as the occurrence of systemic daily wheals for at least 6 weeks.' Since the
presence of IgG autoantibodies (AAbs) to FceRI -chain (FceRIa) and
IgE has been repeatedly observed in patients with CSU,'* autoimmunity is thought to be one of the major causes of CSU.’ However,
the prevalence of anti-FceRIa and anti-IgE AAbs in sera ranged from
4% to 64% and from 0% to 69% among CSU patients and from 0% to
43% and from 0% to 30% among healthy controls, respectively‘ and
these AAbs have also been observed in not only healthy control
subjects but also patients with autoimmune diseases such as
rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.>®
Recently, Kolkhir et al. assessed existing evidence supporting the
role for autoimmunity in CSU using Hill's criteria of causality for
level 1 (causal relationship) to level 5 (causality not likely).4 The IgG
AAbs type of autoimmunity in patients with CSU has been assessed
to have a level 2 causality (causal relationship likely).

Several studies have demonstrated that sera from some patients
with CSU induce histamine release from human basophils and human mast cell lines.’ '! However, sera contain complement and
other factors that may induce histamine release and augment IgGdependent histamine release from basophils.”'* Regarding the histamine release activity of purified IgG from patients with CSU, the
number of examined patients has been small. Purified IgG from
patients with CSU induced histamine release in four out of eight
patients’ and in six out of 11 patients.’ Therefore, to evaluate the
ability of anti-FceRIa or anti-IgE AAbs to induce the crosslinking of
FceRI on mast cells and basophils, purified IgG from a relatively large
number of patients with CSU and healthy control subjects is needed.
Furthermore, the IgE-dependent reactivity of basophils depends on
the donors of the basophils. Which anti-FceRIa or anti-IgE AAbs
activate basophils to induce histamine release is not distinguishable
using basophils unless IgE stripping has been performed. Thus, a
recently developed luciferase-reporting mast cell line (RS-ATL8),
which express human FceRI, to detect IgE crosslinking-induced
luciferase expression (EXiLE),'* was used and modified to measure
mast cell activation by anti-FceRIa and anti-IgE AAbs from patients
with CSU (designated as a modified EXiLE test).

Methods
Ethical considerations

This study was approved by the Ethics Committees of the Nihon
University School of Medicine (RK-15908-12 and RK-160112-2). All
the subjects provided written informed consent in accordance with
the Helsinki Declaration of the World Medical Association.

Patient enrollment

One hundred and thirty eight patients with CSU (93 females and
45 males; ranging in age from 13 to 87 years) were consecutively
recruited between October 2009 and August 2017. Four patients
were excluded because steroids had been used within 3 weeks. The
characteristics of one hundred and thirty four patients with CSU (90
females and 44 males; ranging in age from 13 to 87 years) are
summarized in Table 1. The majority of patients were referred from
private practice doctors to the outpatient clinic of Nihon University
Hospital. Some patients had already received treatment with H1antihistamines. We also enrolled 55 non-atopic healthy control
(NC) subjects (32 females and 23 males; ranging in age from 22 to
57 years) whose criteria were no history of urticaria, asthma,
allergic diseases, or autoimmune diseases (Table 1). Routine blood

Women who were pregnant or nursing were excluded.

Definitions and study protocol

The diagnosis of CSU was made according to the classification of
the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI),
the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA? LEN), the
European Dermatology Forum (EDF), and the World Allergy Organization (WAO).'° Subjects were excluded if steroids or immunosuppressive drugs had been used within 3 weeks. The UAS7 is a
patient-reported scoring system that captures the severity of pruritus and the number of hives appearing during 1 week.'° The intensity of pruritus (range, 0 [none] to 3 [severe]) and the number of
hives (range, O [none] to 3 [>50 hives]) were recorded daily
(maximum, 6 points per day). The scores were then summed for 1
week to represent the UAS7 scale, (0—42). To estimate urticarial
activity, urticaria severity scores were also used according to the
guidelines of the Japanese Dermatology Association
(Supplementary Table 1).'’ Blood tests, which included serum IgE
levels, basophil counts, IgG anti-nuclear AAbs, IgG antithyroglobulin AAbs, and IgG anti-thyroid microsomal AAbs, were
performed.

Autologous serum skin test (ASST)

The ASST was performed using 50 uL of the patient's own serum
intradermally injected into the flexor aspect of the forearm; 50 pL of
saline was injected 3—5 cm away as a control. The results were
measured after 30 min. If the serum-injected site manifested a
wheal with a diameter of 1.5 mm greater than that of the salineinjected site, the result was considered positive.'® According to
the EAACI/GA (2)LEN task force consensus report,'® antihistamines
were discontinued for 2—3 days prior to the ASST. The sera used for
the ASST were also used for measurement of concentrations of the
AAbs and the abilities of the AAbs to induce FceRI-crosslinking

Isolation of IgG fraction from serum

IgG was purified from sera of patients with CSU and NC subjects
using Ab-Rapid SPiN EX (ProteNova, Kagawa, Japan) according to
the manufacturer's protocol. The purified IgG was reconstituted
with PBS using Amicon centrifugal filter units (Merck Millipore,
Darmstadt, HE, Germany). The final concentrations of the purified
IgG were diluted to one-sixth of the serum IgG concentrations.

Expression of recombinant human (rh) soluble form of FceRIa
ectodomain (soluble FceRIa) and purification of secreted rh soluble
FceRIa

The truncated human FceRIa ectodomain (1—172 amino acids)
was secreted from transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as
described.'® Secreted rh soluble FceRIo. was purified from the culture supernatant of the cells using mouse anti-FceRIa (clone
CRA2).7° rh soluble FceRIa. was eluted using an acid buffer (0.1 M
glycine/0.2 M NaCl, pH 2.7), immediately neutralized using a basic
buffer (1 M Tris—HCl, pH 9), quantified using Bradford method, and
applied to a gradient gel for SDS-PAGE, as described previously.'°

Generation of humanized anti-human FceRIa mAb, clone CRA2

The anti-human FceRIa mAb, clone CRA2,2° was humanized by
complementarity-determining region grafting onto human V region frameworks encoded by human germline V and J genes, as
described previously.”! Appropriate light and heavy chain expression vectors were co-transfected into COS7 cells using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), as described
previously.*! The purification of recombinant mAb was performed
as described.”°

Measurement of concentrations of anti-FceRIa AAbs

An ELISA for detecting anti-human FceRIa AAbs was performed
as previously described®* ** with the exception that a standard
curve for IgG anti-FceRIa was generated using humanized antiFceRIa mAb (clone CRA2, isotype human IgG1).7! Briefly, 1 g/mL of
purified recombinant soluble FceRIa proteins'® in sodium carbonate, pH 9.6 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), were used to coat polystyrene microwells of an ELISA plate (Maxisorp; Nunc, Roskilde,
Denmark) in duplicates and were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The
plate was washed 4 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20
(PBST) and then blocked with 10% FBS in PBS for 1 h at room
temperature. After washing, the purified IgG from the sera of NC
subjects and patients with CSU were added at a 1:10 dilution with
PBS to each well, then incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After
washing, HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG mAb (clone G18-145; BD
Pharmingen, Franklin, NJ), HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG1 mAb
(clone HP6069; ThermofFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), or HRPconjugated anti-human IgG4 mAb (clone HP6025; ThermoFisher
Scientific) was added to each well at a 1:10,000 dilution for
measuring its concentration of total IgG, IgG1 or IgG4, respectively,
then incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The reactions in the
wells were developed with hydrogen peroxide plus 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine in 100 mM citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 5.0 (KPL,
Gaithersburg, MD), and their absorbances were monitored at
450 nm and 570 nm using a Multiskan GO microplate spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) after the addition of 2 N
sulfuric acid. The linear region of the standard curve was used to
quantify the anti-FceRIa in the purified IgG.

 

 

Measurement of concentrations of anti-IgE AAbs

An ELISA was used to detect anti-IgE AAbs, as previously
described.” *’ Briefly, the polystyrene microwells of an ELISA
plate (Maxisorp) were coated with human myeloma IgE (1 »g/mLin
sodium carbonate pH 9.6, Calbiochem) and incubated overnight at
4°C. Unbound protein was removed by four washes with PBST. Free
binding sites were blocked by incubation with 10% FBS in PBS for
1 h at room temperature. After washing, the purified IgG from the
sera of NC subjects and patients with CSU were added at a 1:10
dilution with PBS to each well, which were then incubated for 2 h at

room temperature. After washing, HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG
mAb (clone G18-145) was added to each well at a 1:10,000 dilution,
which was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The reactions in the wells were developed as mentioned above. The
quantity of reactive IgG was calculated using standard amounts of
purified human IgG (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, West
Grove, PA) ranging from 0.775 ng/mL to 50 ng/mL bound directly to
the plates. To normalize the data among the plates, one specific
donor (CSU donor# 35)'s anti-IgE AAbs level was measured
repeatedly on all of the plates.

Preparation of RS-ATL8 cells*® and RBL-NLA4 cells

RS-ATL8 cells or RBL-NL4 cells (2.0 x 10° cells/1000 L/well)
were cultured in MEM containing 10% FBS, 1% GlutaMAX-I, 100 U/
mL penicillin, 100 j1g/mL streptomycin, 0.5 mg/mL geneticin and
0.2 mg/mL hygromycin B on a Costar® 24-well clear tissue culturetreated multiple well plate (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) at 37 °C for 2
days in a 5% CO2 incubator.** The cells were re-plated and cultured
as described above for an additional 2 days. The cells were then replated on a 96-well plate at 2 x 104 cells/50 ,tL/well and cultured at
37 °C overnight in a 5% CO2 incubator.

Measurement of the ability of anti-FceRIa and anti-IgE AAbs to
induce FceRI crosslinking using an in vitro elicitation test (modified
EXiLE test)

An in vitro elicitation test was modified from a previously
described method reported by us.?° The test was performed by
assessing an EXiLE test using human FceRlaPy2 genes- and nuclear
factor of activated T-cell (NF-AT)-responsive luciferase reporter
gene-introduced rat basophilic leukemia cells (RS-ATLS cells).'“ The
purified IgG was replaced with MEM containing 10% FBS, 1%
GlutaMAX-I, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 g/mL streptomycin, 0.5 mg/
ml geneticin and 0.2 mg/mL hygromycin B, using Amicon centrifugal filter units (Merck Millipore). To measure the ability of antiFceRI AAbs to induce FceRI crosslinking, 50 uL of purified IgG
(equivalent to a 1:6 dilution of the serum IgG levels) obtained from
NC subjects or CSU patients was added to each well and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h in a 5% CO2 incubator. To
measure the ability of anti-IgE AAbs to induce FceRI-crosslinking,
the purified IgG was pre-incubated with well-coated rh soluble
FceRIa. (1 pg/mL), and the supernatants were sequentially incubated with well-coated rh soluble FceRIa twice. Then, the supernatants were applied to IgE-sensitized RS-ATLS8 cells. Fifty uL of
luciferase substrate solution containing a cell lysis reagent (ONE
Glo, Promega, Madison, WI) was added to the cells, and the
chemiluminescence was measured using a Centro LB 960 plate
reader (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Standard
curves for the fold inductions in luciferase fluorescence were
induced by mouse anti-human FceRIa mAb (clone CRA1; eBioscience, San Diego, CA) or rabbit anti-human IgE Ab (Dako, Santa
Clora, CA). The luciferase expression levels were represented as the
fold increase in light units compared with the results in nonstimulated cells. The minimum concentration of CRA1 or rabbit
anti-human IgE Ab that induced a significantly higher intensity of
luciferase fluorescence than that observed in the non-stimulated
wells was used to define as the sensitivity of the EXiLE test.

 

Removal of anti-FceRIa AAbs from purified IgG obtained from CSU
patients

To examine whether anti-FceRIa AAbs were directly bound to
cell surface FceRI on RS-ATL8 cells, purified IgG from the sera o
patients with CSU was pre-incubated with well-coated rh soluble

FceRIa (1 jg/mL), and the supernatants were sequentially incubated with well-coated rh soluble FceRIa twice. As positive control,
humanized anti-FceRIa mAb (clone CRA2) in place of the antiFceRIa AAbs obtained from patients with CSU was similarly preincubated in wells coated with rh soluble FceRIa. Then, the supernatants were applied to the RS-ATLS8 cells for use in the modified
EXiLE test.

Removal of anti-IgE AAbs from purified IgG obtained from CSU
patients

To examine whether anti-IgE AAbs bind directly to cell surfacebound IgE on RS-ATLS8 cells, anti-FceRIa AAbs-absorbed purified IgG
from sera obtained from patients with CSU was pre-incubated with
well-coated human myeloma IgE (1 pg/mL, Calbiochem), and the
supernatants were sequentially incubated with well-coated human
myeloma IgE twice. Then, the supernatants were applied to IgEsensitized RS-ATL8 cells for the modified EXiLE test.

Basophil isolation, purification and basophil activation test

Blood samples were collected from 3 healthy donors. Basophilenriched suspensions were obtained by Percoll (GE Healthcare UK,
Buckinghamshire, England) density gradient centrifugation. Briefly,
basophil-enriched preparations were isolated from whole fresh
blood. Blood was layered over a two-step discontinuous Percoll
gradient consisting of 15 mL of 62% Percoll overlaid with 15 mL of
53% Percoll prepared in 50 mL tubes and centrifuged. A basophil
rich layer, which was located 1 cm above the 53/62% interface, was
harvested.”° Furthermore, basophil enrichment was carried out by
using a negative selection method with the Human Basophil
Isolation Kit II (Milteny Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany).°° The
purified basophils (purity; 70-94%) were suspended in Hepes
buffer. The number of basophils used for the experiments was
adjusted to 2 x 10* cells/100 tL. The purified basophils were
stimulated with CRA1, rabbit anti-human IgE Ab (Dako) or Nformyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fmlp; Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) for 30 min at 37 °C. Activation was stopped by chilling

 

on ice for 5 min. Thereafter, the cells were labeled with FITCconjugated anti-CD123 (Biolegend, San Diego, CA) and PEconjugated anti-CD203c (Milteny Biotec) and incubated for
20 min on ice. Finally, cells were washed and analyzed on a flow
cytometer. Only basophils with bright CD123 expression were
gated. Data on at least 1000 basophils were acquired, and the
percentage of CD203c-expressing basophils was calculated.*!

Statistical analysis

To identify variables associated with CSU or a specific CSU patient group, we compared continuous variables between the NC
subjects and patients with CSU or between two different patient
groups using the Mann-Whitney-U test; to compare categorical
variables, a 2-sided Fisher exact test was used. We estimated the
effects on the odds ratio using a 2-sided Fisher exact test. The
receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) was used to
determine the optimal cutoff values that maximized the sum of the
specificity and sensitivity. Spearman rank correlation coefficients
were calculated to determine the strength of the correlations between continuous variables. P value was considered significant at
P < 0.05. The data analyses were performed using Prism version 7
(GraphPad software; San Diego, CA).

Results

Comparison of concentrations of anti-FceRIa and anti-IgE AAbs
between NC subjects and patients with CSU

We first compared the concentrations of anti-FceRIa and antiIgE AAbs between 55 NC subjects and 134 patients with CSU. The
concentrations of anti-IgE AAbs were significantly different between the NC subjects and the CSU patients (Fig. 1B, C; P < 0.0001;
odds ratio, 7.14 with a cutoff value of 0.558 ug/mL, sensitivity,
76.2%; specificity, 69.1% by ROC curve analysis comparing NC subjects and CSU patients), but those of anti-FceRIa AAbs were not
(Fig. 1A). A significant correlation was not seen between the

concentrations of anti-FceRI« and anti-IgE AAbs in both NC subjects
(Fig. 1D) and patients with CSU (Fig. 1E).

Next, to clarify the clinical characteristics between CSU patients
with lower and higher concentrations of anti-IgE AAbs relative to
the cutoff value, we compared the variables between these two
groups of CSU patients. While no significant differences in the patient age, urticaria severity scores, frequency of positive results of
ASST, or clinical data including the serum IgE levels, basophil
counts, the concentrations of anti-FceRIa AAbs, and positive rates of
IgG AAbs to nucleus, thyroglobulin, and thyroid microsomal protein
were observed between the two patient groups, a significant difference in the duration of illness was noted between the two
groups, as shown in Table 2 (P = 0.0101).

Evaluation of ability of anti-FceRIa to induce FceRI aggregation in
patients with CSU, compared with NC subjects

Next, we evaluated the ability of anti-FceRIa to induce FceRI
aggregation in NC subjects and patients with CSU using the
modified EXiLE test. We evaluated the accuracy of this assay.
Figure 2A shows the standard curve for the fold inductions in
luciferase fluorescence induced by mouse anti-human FceRIa mAb
(clone CRA1). As a positive control, the fold inductions in luciferase
fluorescence induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
(PMA) + ionomycin were used (Supplementary Fig. 1A). To clarify
that the effect of anti-FceRIa AAbs was mediated by cell surface
FceRI on RS-ATL8 cells, purified IgG from patients with CSU was
preincubated with well-coated rh soluble FceRIa, and the resulting
supernatants were used in the modified EXiLE test. The results
clearly showed that removal of anti-FceRIa AAbs from purified IgG
obtained from the CSU patients significantly blocked the effects of
FceRI crosslinking induced by anti-FceRIa AAbs (Fig. 2B-a,
P = 0.0039). Pre-incubation of humanized anti-FceRla mAb (clone
CRA2) with soluble FceRIa completely blocked the effects (Fig. 2Bb). Also, we confirmed that humanized anti-FceRIla mAb (clone
CRA2) induced less than 1.5-fold increase of luciferase fluorescence
in the control cells, which consisted of NF-AT-responsive luciferase
reporter gene-introduced rat basophilic leukemia cells without the
induction of human FceRlaBy2 genes (RBL-NL4 cells), and the fold
increases in the luciferase fluorescence intensity were not

PMA + ionomycin induced ~350-fold increase of luciferase fluorescence (Supplementary Fig. 1C). We used purified IgG (equivalent
to a 1:6 dilution of the serum IgG levels) from NC subjects or CSU
patients in the assays to compare the ability of the anti-FceRIa AAbs
to induce FceRI aggregation and to avoid the effects of other components, such as complement and IgE to autoantigens in the
sera.*”*? As can be seen in Figure 2C, anti-FceRIa AAbs from the CSU
patients did not induce significantly more FceRI crosslinking than
anti-FceRIa, AAbs from the NC subjects (P = 0.131). Only 4 of the 134
patients with CSU exhibited higher values than the highest value
observed in the NC subjects (2.117-fold increase in the ability of
anti-FceRIa AAbs to induce FceRI crosslinking). The maximum effects of the anti-FceRIa AAbs from patients with CSU were almost
equivalent to those induced by ~10 ng/mL of CRA1 (Fig. 2A). Significant correlations were not seen between the concentrations of
anti-FceRIa AAbs and the levels of FceRI crosslinking in NC subjects
and CSU patients (Fig. 2D, E). There were no significant differences
in clinical parameters between CSU patients with over 2.117 fold
increase of the ability of anti-FceRIa AAbs to induce FceRI crosslinking and patients with lower 2.117 fold increase of the ability of it
(data not shown).

Evaluation of ability of anti-[gE AAbs to induce FceRI aggregation in
patients with CSU, compared with NC subjects

Next, we similarly evaluated the ability of anti-IgE AAbs to
induce FceRI aggregation in NC subjects and patients with CSU
using the modified EXiLE test. We evaluated the accuracy of this
assay. Figure 3A shows the standard curve for the fold inductions in
luciferase fluorescence induced by rabbit anti-human IgE Ab. To
clarify that the effect of anti-IgE AAbs was mediated by cell surfacebound IgE on RS-ATL8 cells, purified IgG from patients with CSU
was preincubated with well-coated human myeloma IgE and soluble FceRIa, and the resulting supernatants were used in the
modified EXiLE test. The results clearly showed that the removal of
both anti-IgE and anti-FceRIa AAbs from purified IgG obtained from
CSU patients significantly blocked the effects of FceRI crosslinking
induced by anti-IgE AAbs (Fig. 3B-a; P = 0.0039). Pre-incubation of
rabbit anti-human IgE Ab with human myeloma IgE and soluble
FceRIa blocked the effects (Fig. 3B-b). We used purified IgG
(equivalent to a 1:6 dilution of the serum IgG levels) from NC
subjects or CSU patients in the assays. To avoid the effects of antiFceRIa. AAbs, anti-FceRIa AAbs in purified IgG were absorbed. For
IgE sensitization, the RS-ATL8 cells were incubated with human
myeloma IgE for 30 min at 37 °C. As can be seen in Figure 3C, antiIgE AAbs from the CSU patients induced significantly more FceRI
crosslinking than anti-IgE AAbs from the NC subjects (P = 0.0106;
odds ratio, 2.51) with a cutoff value of a 1.302-fold increase derived
from a ROC analysis comparing NC subjects and CSU patients
(Fig. 3D; sensitivity, 70.8% and specificity, 50.9%). Seventy percent
of the patients with CSU exhibited a value that was over the cutoff
value for the discrimination of the ability anti-IgE AAbs to induce
FceRI crosslinking. The maximum effects of the anti-IgE AAbs from
patients with CSU were almost equivalent to those induced by
0.3 g/mL of rabbit anti-human IgE Ab (Fig. 3A). Significant correlations were not seen between the concentrations of anti-IgE AAbs
and the levels of FceRI crosslinking in NC subjects and CSU patients
(Fig. 3E, F). There were no significant differences in clinical parameters between CSU patients with a value lower than the cutoff
value for the discrimination of the ability of anti-IgE AAbs to induce
FceRI crosslinking (<1.302-fold) and patients with a value higher
than the cutoff value (>1.302-fold, Table 3). Although no significant
correlations were observed between the ability of anti-FceRIa and
anti-IgE AAbs to induce FceRI aggregation in NC subjects (Fig. 3G)

Comparison of the modified EXiLE test with the histamine release
assay in human basophils and cultured synovium-derived mast cells
following FceRI aggregation

The values of the modified EXiLE test were compared with the
results of the histamine release assay for human basophils and
human synovium-derived cultured mast cells in response to
0.03—1000 ng/mL of mouse anti-human FceRIa mAb (clone CRA1)
or 0.01—10 pg/mL of rabbit anti-human IgE Ab. Human basophils
were activated in response to 3—1000 ng/mL of CRA1 (Fig. 4A).
Comparison of the results of the basophil activation test (Fig. 4A)
and modified EXiLE test for CRA1 (Fig. 2A) revealed a 30- to-100fold higher sensitivity of the latter for detecting FceRI crosslinking. The human synovium-derived cultured mast cells induced
histamine release in response to 3—1000 ng/mL of CRA1 (Fig. 4C).
Human basophils and human synovium-derived cultured mast
cells were activated in response to 0.03—10.00 jwg/mL and
0.01—10.00 j1g/mL of anti-human IgE Ab, respectively (Fig. 4B, D),
indicating that the anti-IgE AAbs from patients with CSU had the
ability to induce histamine release from both human basophils and
synovium-cultured mast cells.

Discussion

This is the first definite report to demonstrate that the abilities
of anti-IgE AAbs in purified IgG obtained from a large number of
patients with CSU to induce FceRI crosslinking were significantly
higher than those of anti-IgE AAbs from NC subjects (Fig. 3C);
however, similar results were not observed for anti-FceRla AAbs
(Fig. 2C). When the modified EXiLE tests was compared to activation assays for human basophils and synovium-derived cultured
mast cells (Fig. 4), the modified EXiLE test was found to be

appropriate for evaluating the crosslinking of FceRI by anti-IgE AAbs
in a disease context.

Our observation suggests that there is something qualitatively
different about these AAbs in the sera of patients with CSU that
causes them to crosslink FceRI and thus could be a mechanism of the
CSU for this population of patients with CSU. The finding that there
was no correlation between the concentrations of anti-IgE AAbs and
the ability of the AAbs to induce FceRI crosslinking in purified IgG
from patients with CSU (Fig. 3E) suggests that only a small fraction of
the total AAbs are responsible for driving the disease per se. AntiFceRIa and anti-IgE AAbs from patients with CSU would contain
polyclonal Abs in nature and might contain a mixture of anti-FceRIa
and anti-IgE AAbs with different biological functions, including
different isotypes. Thus, these findings support the hypothesis that
either the avidity of the offending AAbs is different from that of the
innocuous ones, that the bound epitopes differ, or that the proportion of isotypes of the AAbs differ. We found that the avidity of antiFceRIa AAbs from patients with CSU was significantly higher than
that from NC subjects (Supplementary Fig. 2A, P = 0.012), but there
was no significant correlation between the avidity of anti-FceRIa
AAbs and the ability of anti-FceRIa. AAbs to induce FceRI crosslinking
in patients with CSU (Supplementary Fig. 2B). Also, the ratio of IgG1
anti-FceRIa AAbs to IgG4 anti-FceRla AAbs between NC subjects and
patients with CSU were not significant (Supplementary Fig. 2C).
Although we were unable to investigate the difference in the epitopes of these AAbs between NC subjects and patients with CSU, the
different abilities of anti-FceRIa and anti-IgE AAbs to induce FceRI
crosslinking may be due to the mixtures of different avidities, epitopes and isotypes of the offending and innocuous AAbs in patients
with CSU. Further studies are needed to clarify the qualitative difference in anti-FceRIa and anti-IgE AAbs between NC subjects and
patients with CSU.

Since complement was excluded in our modified EXiLE test for
measuring the ability of these AAbs to induce FceRI crosslinking by
using purified IgG, the fold increases were induced by IgG alone.
Another factor that would affect the modified EXiLE test is crosslinking between FcyRIIb and FceRI. Human IgGs reportedly bind to

neuropeptides,*°*” coagulation factors*® and unknown factors. A
positive result of the ASST apparently persisted even after IgG
depletion from the sera of patients with CSU, suggesting that a
positive result of ASST may indicate the presence of other vasoactive factors rather than that of IgG AAbs.*?

A significant difference in the duration of illness was noted
between CSU patients with lower and higher concentrations of
anti-IgE AAbs relative to the cutoff value (Table 2, P = 0.0101). The
mechanisms have been unknown. Previous studies reported that
the presence of serum anti-thyroid AAbs, levels of vitamin D, total
IgE levels, and the present with concomitant angioedema or
inducible urticaria were linked to disease duration.4° Further
research is needed to clarify the mechanisms why CSU patients
with higher concentrations of anti-IgE AAbs may show longer
disease duration.

Because the specificity revealed by the ROC analysis was only
50.9%, many NC subjects had higher titers than the tentative cutoff
value. This was a limitation of the present study. We could not
estimate a definite cutoff value for the ability of anti-IgE AAbs for
aggregation of FceRI because of the small number of patients and
the paucity of previous reports suitable for verifying the validity of
the cutoff value. The findings need to be confirmed in different
cohorts, each comprising at least 200 individuals.

The result of this study is different from those published previously by researchers in the USA and Europe. They reported that
the frequencies of patients, whose sera containing anti-FceRIa AAbs

have ability of degranulation of basophils, were higher compared
with those, whose sera containing anti-IgE AAbs do“! ~*? and that
the frequencies of anti-FceRIa AAbs-positive patients were higher
than those of anti-IgE AAbs.?°*?*? Several groups°?!!!341:42.4445
have reported that the percentage of patients (or subjects) carrying anti-FceRIa AAbs was higher in patients with CSU than in NC
subjects. Although Fiebiger et al.'° have reported that in patients
with CSU the percentage of anti-IgE AAbs carrying patients (69%)
was higher than the percentage of anti-FceRIa AAbs carrying patients (37.5%), they also found anti-IgE AAbs in 73% and 26% of
patients with atopic dermatitis and healthy controls, respectively
and they found anti-FceRIa AAbs neither in patients with atopic
dermatitis nor healthy controls, suggesting that anti-IgE AAbs are
poorly disease specific. A few have reported that the percentage of
patients (or subjects) carrying anti-FceRIa AAbs did not differ between CSU patients and NC subjects.”“*?° This discrepancy might
be due to the different methods used for detecting the AAbs or
differences in the populations examined. Furthermore, the finding
that concentration of anti-IgE AAbs was significantly different between the NC subjects and CSU patients, whereas that of antiFceRIa AAbs was not, may be consistent with the clinical observation that omalizumab, a humanized anti-IgE mAb, was effective in
most antihistamine-refractory CSU patients.” However, further
studies are required to validate this hypothesis.

In conclusion, the ability of anti-IlgE AAbs, compared with antiFceRIa AAbs, to induce FceRI crosslinking was capable o'
