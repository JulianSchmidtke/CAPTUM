Abstract. Previous studies on the correlation between positive
autologous serum skin test (ASST) responses and the clinical
features of patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU)
have provided conflicting results. To evaluate the significance
of ASST responses in CSU, a variety of databases were
searched from inception to March 2018 to identify relevant
studies on CSU. Data were analyzed with use of the Cochrane
Collaboration's Review Manager 5.2. Multiple relevant factors
of CSU were evaluated by calculating the weighted mean
difference, odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. The results
indicated that CSU cases with positive ASST responses had
higher urticaria activity scores and higher levels of total serum
immunoglobulin E than CSU cases with negative responses
in the ASST. In addition, a positive ASST response was
more likely to be accompanied with the presence of thyroid
autoantibodies and angioedema. An increased prevalence of
CSU was identified in females, who were more likely to have
a positive response in the ASST. It was also indicated that a
greater incidence of positive ASST responses was present in
CSU patients as compared with that in healthy controls. No
statistically significant differences were obtained between
positive and negative ASST responses with regard to age and
duration of disease. Based on these results, it was concluded

Introduction

Chronic urticaria (CU), more commonly referred to as hives, is
a frequently occurring condition that may persist for >6 weeks.
CU is subdivided into chronic autoimmune urticaria (CAU),
chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and physical urticaria
(PU), and CSU accounts for 35% of CU patients (1). The
mechanisms of CSU are complex and may be triggered by
drugs, physical stimuli, as part of inflammatory or inherited
diseases, or may be idiopathic in nature. Over half of all CSU
cases are thought to involve autoimmune mechanisms (2).
The autologous serum skin test (ASST) provides an in vivo
assay for diagnosing autoimmune urticaria. The ASST
procedure consists of collecting an autologous serum sample
from the CU patient, followed by injection of this sample into
an area of normal skin. A positive response is indicated by
the appearance of an erythematous papule within 30 min
following injection (3).

The ASST serves as an effective clinical screening tool
and has become the established method for the detection of
functional circulating auto-antibodies in patients with CU.
The negative predictive value (NPV) of the ASST has been
reported to be 82.5+14% (4). This means that in CU patients
with a negative response to the ASST, no functional circulating auto-antibodies were present in their serum. However,
a positive ASST response may occur in patients with allergic
diseases and even in healthy controls. Therefore, to confirm
the presence of an autoimmune disorders, a quantitative
analysis is required (5). It has been reported that in cases with
positive ASST responses, a higher urticaria activity score
(UAS), longer disease durations, lower scores on quality of
life questionnaires and increased potentials for accompanying
angioedema were present (6,7).

CU is a benign disease, has an autoimmune basis in 40%
of cases (8) and is more prevalent in females. Immunoglobulin
(IgE) has an indispensable role in the occurrence of CSU (9,10),
with autoantibodies targeting high-affinity IgE receptors
(FceRI) or IgE in patients with CSU (11). Thyroid disease is
2604

the most commonly reported autoimmune condition in patients
with CSU. CSU patients with coexisting thyroid autoimmunity
tend to have a more severe and prolonged course of their urticaria than those without thyroid autoimmunity. A recent study
has indicated that 9.8% of CU patients had hypothyroidism,
compared with 0.6% in the control group (12). CU and thyroid
disease may be interlinked, and the latter may promote the
occurrence of CU (13). Previous studies have produced controversial results about the associations between positive ASST
responses and the clinical features of CSU. Therefore, the
current meta-analysis was undertaken to clarify the association between ASST and CSU.

Materials and methods

Literature search. The PubMed, Embase, Medline, Ovid,
Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure,
China Biology Medicine and Wangfang databases, as well
as the VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals were
searched to identify relevant studies involving ASST and
clinical features of CSU. This search included the period from
inception of the database until March 2018. The search strategy
combined the following terms: ‘Autologous serum skin test’
and ‘chronic spontaneous urticaria’. There was no restriction
regarding language or the type of article. An additional manual
search was performed by screening the references listed in key
publications retrieved in this search.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria. An overall literature search
was performed and relevant studies were screened independently by two reviewers. Eligible studies were selected
based on the following criteria: i) Study design: Prospective
observational study. ii) Patients with clinically defined CU.
iii) Information on responses to the ASST. iv) Information on
at least one of the following parameters: Average age, duration
of disease, UAS, angioedema, anti-thyroid antibodies, total
serum IgE, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and allergic rhinitis.
The exclusion criteria were as follows: i) Experiments on
animal models; ii) cases lacking a definitive diagnosis of CU;
iii) intervention trials; iv) reports lacking relevant/sufficient
data; v) duplicate publications.

Data extraction. Relevant data were extracted by two reviewers
independently. Information included in the forms prepared by
these reviewers comprised the following: First author's name,
publication year, number of patients, mean age, duration of
disease, results of ASST, UAS, angioedema, anti-thyroid
antibodies, total serum IgE and allergic rhinitis.

Assessment of study quality. Quality assessment of included
studies was independently performed and crosschecked by
two reviewers using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS), which
assesses bias on a scale of up to nine stars; >6 stars on the NOS
were regarded as indicative of a high quality.

Statistical analysis. The meta-analysis was performed using
Review Manager 5.2 (the Cochrane Institute, London, UK).
The inverse-variance test was applied for continuous variables
and the Mantel-Haenszel test for examination of dichotomous
variables. The weighted mean difference (WMD) was used

NIU et al: CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS OF AUTOLOGOUS SERUM SKIN TEST IN CHRONIC URTICARIA

for continuous variables across studies that were measured
on the same scale. Dichotomous variables were assessed by
calculating the odds ratio (OR). All data were expressed as
the WMD or OR along with their associated 95% confidence
intervals (CI). Heterogeneity between studies was tested by
using I? tests. P<0.1 or P>50% was considered to indicate a
high degree of heterogeneity between studies. If a significant
heterogeneity was present (P<0.1), the random effects model
was selected for heterogeneous outcomes (P<0.05 or ?’=50%),
otherwise, the fixed effects model was performed for homogeneous outcomes (P=0.05 and I?<50%). P<0.05 was considered
to represent statistically significant differences.

A sensitivity analysis was performed by removing studies
one at a time to confirm the robustness of the results. Finally,
publication bias in the analysis was determined using a funnel
plot and Egger's regression test.

Results

Study characteristics. A total of 1,629 relevant studies were
retrieved. After removal of duplicates by title, 851 articles were
further screened. Following a careful review of these studies,
the full text of 39 studies were assessed. Finally, 16 articles
met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic
review (6,7,14-27). The selection process for these studies is
summarized in Fig. 1. A total of 2,554 patients, including
1,284 with positive and 1,270 with negative ASST results were
assessed. The characteristics of these patients are presented
in Table I. The publication year ranged from 2005 to 2017. Of
note, the search of all databases for eligible articles revealed
that the region of all studies retrieved was Asia, including
China, Thailand, Korea, India, Taiwan and Japan.

Quality assessment of included studies. Detailed results
regarding the quality assessment are summarized in Table I.
All included studies were prospective observational studies.
The present meta-analysis was restricted to studies with a low
risk of bias (NOS =7), and the entire analysis was replicated
following removal of the most influential study on the basis of
its weight.

Comparison of the influence of ASST responses on CSU cases
and heathy controls. Of all studies reviewed, 6 provided data on
ASST responses in heathy controls (15,19,21,23,25). Statistical
analysis revealed a high degree of homogeneity across studies
(P=0.18, P=34%). Meta-analysis using the fixed-effects model
indicated that CSU cases were more frequently associated with
positive ASST responses than the healthy controls (P<0.01,
OR=17.16, 95% CI, 9.31-31.63; Fig. 2).

Comparison of age, duration of disease and UAS in
positive and negative ASST cases. Of all 16 studies,
14 (6,7,14,18,20,24,26,27) and 10 (6,14,16,17,19,22,24,26,27)
provided data on age and duration of disease, respectively,
in the two groups. A significant heterogeneity was present
across the studies (age: P<0.001, I?=95%; duration: P<0.001,
*=83%), necessitating use of the random-effects model.
The meta-analysis indicated that the two groups displayed
no Statistically significant differences in age (P=0.96,
WMD=0.11, 95% CI, -4.31 to 4.52; Fig. 3) and duration

(P=0.08, WMD=5.48, 95% CI, -0.71 to 11.68; Fig. 4). A
subgroup analysis regarding patient age was then performed,
in which patients were stratified by region. Results from
China and India indicated that the two groups exhibited
no difference in age (China: P=0.15, WMD=3.95, 95% CI,
-1.49 to 9.39; India: P=0.18, WMD=-1.88, 95% CI, -4.63 to
0.87). Of note, the results from Korea, Thailand and Taiwan
indicated that a positive ASST response was associated with
younger age (Korea: P=0.04, WMD=-3.68, 95% CI, -7.21 to
-0.16; Taiwan: P=0.01, WMD=-9.6, 95% CI, -16.9 to -2.30;
Thailand: P=0.002, WMD=-5.50, 95% CI, -9.04 to -1.96),
while the opposite result was obtained in Japan (P=0.02,
WMD=6.06, 95% CI, 0.85-11.27; Fig. 3). Another subgroup
analysis was performed with stratification by duration of
disease (<30 vs. >30 months). It was revealed that in patients
with a duration of disease of <30 months, the disease duration was not significantly associated with the result of the
ASST (P=0.59, WMD=-1.52, 95% CI, -7.03 to 3.99), while
in those with a duration of disease of >30 months, a positive
ASST response was associated with a significantly increased
duration of disease as compared with that in patients with a
negative ASST response (P=0.002, WMD=15.93, 95% CI,
56.64-26.22; Fig. 4).

Atotalof11 studies provideddataonUAS (6,7,15,17,21,23,27).
Statistically significant heterogeneity was present across these
studies (P=0.01, I?=59%), again resulting in the use of the
random-effects model. The meta-analysis revealed that the
positive ASST response group had a higher UAS than that
of the negative ASST response group (P<0.001, WMD=0.42,
95% CI, 0.35-0.50; Fig. 5). Therefore, a subgroup analysis
was performed based on the range of UAS as estimated by
employing different guidelines, including European (28) and

Korean guidelines (29). The results of this subgroup analysis
also indicated that the positive ASST response group had a
higher UAS than the negative ASST response group [UAS
(0-6): P<0.001, WMD=0.41, 95% CI, 0.33-0.49; UAS (0-9):
P<0.001, WMD=0.77, 95% CI, 0.36-1.18; UAS (0-18): P=0.00,
WMD2=1.18, 95% CI, 0.57-1.80]. However, the results of UAS
of 0-12 was at the verge of statistical significance, however it
was not statistically significant (P=0.05, WMD=0.60, 95% CI,
0.00-1.20, and an inverse result was observed for UAS of 0-15
(P=0.04, WMD=-0.73, 95% CI, -1.41 to -0.05). In addition,
two studies provided the median and range of UAS but no
standard deviation (SD) (25,27). The SD was then calculated
using an established formula (30).

Comparison of total serum IgE, angioedema and anti-thyroid
autoantibodies in positive and negative ASST groups. Of all
studies included in the present review, 4 (16-18,26) provided
data on total serum IgE and 8 (16,18-22,26,27) on the presence
of thyroid autoantibodies in the two groups. Statistical analysis
indicated that a significant homogeneity was present across
these studies (serum total IgE: P=0.78, I°=0%; anti-thyroid
autoantibodies: P=0.38, ’'=7%). Meta-analysis using the
fixed-effects model indicated that a positive ASST result was
associated with higher levels of total serum IgE (P<0.001,
WMD=41.99, 95% CI, 20.40 to 63.58; Fig. 6) and thyroid

autoantibodies (P<0.01, OR=1.87, 95% CI, 1.19-2.94; Fig. 7)
than a negative ASST result.

Data from 7 studies provided information on angioedema
in the two groups. As the results on angioedema displayed
a Statistically significant heterogeneity across studies
(P=0.03, I’=57%), it was necessary to use the random-effects
model. Meta-analysis revealed that a positive ASST result
was associated with a higher risk of angioedema than that
of a negative ASST result (P=0.03, OR=1.92, 95% Cl,
1.08-3.40; Fig. 8). Angioedema is a subjective index of
urticaria and manifests in a relatively short-lived edema
in the skin. The occurrence of angioedema is affected by
inherited and environmental factors; furthermore, physical
stimulators, including shock and pressure, may also induce
angioedema (31). As a result, a substantial heterogeneity in
angioedema data may be present.

Sex differences among subjects with positive ASST responses.
An included study demonstrated that females are more likely
to have a positive ASST response as rates of ASST were
78% and 22% in females and males, respectively (15). Of all
studies included in the present review, 12 (7,14,18,20,22,24,27),
which accounted for 1462 cases, contained 756 cases with positive responses to ASST. Of these 756 cases, 210 were males
and 546 were females. Statistical analysis of positive ASST

addition, a sensitivity analysis was applied for each index
involving ASST comparisons. The sensitivity analysis
demonstrated that the results obtained using the random- and
fixed-effects models were in accordance with each study
included in the review. These results suggested that no individual studies significantly affected the pooled results. This
indicated that the meta-analysis performed provided reliable
results.

Detection of publication bias. An analysis of publication bias
was performed by using Egger's regression test. The results
indicated that no publication bias was present regarding the
UAS and sex differences among patients with positive ASST
responses (UAS: Z=-2.18, P=0.06; sex differences among
patients with positive ASST response: Z=-0.73, P=0.48).
However, publication bias was present with regard to age
and duration of CSU (age: Z=-3.93, P=0.002; duration of
CSU: Z=4.23, P=0.003). Although the above results revealed
that studies included in the present review displayed an

inconformity in publication bias, the funnel plots had typical
shapes, and the funnel plot of anti-thyroid autoantibodies is
presented in Fig. 10.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first
systematic review comparing ASST responses in patients
with CSU. The results obtained by the meta-analysis suggest
that cases with positive ASST responses had higher UAS
and higher levels of serum total IgE than those of cases with
negative ASST responses. In addition, cases with positive
responses to ASST were more likely to have accompanying
angioedema and were positive for thyroid autoantibodies. CSU
was more prevalent in females, who were also more likely to
exhibit a positive response to ASST. It was also confirmed
that a greater incidence of ASST was present in CSU patients
as compared with that in heathy controls. No statistically
significant differences were present between cases with

positive vs. negative responses to ASST with regard to patient
age and duration of disease.

Angioedema, which is the clinical manifestation of urticaria, develops when urticaria is located within the subcutis.
It is a syndrome characterized by a sudden and limited
subcutaneous and/or submucous swelling. Angioedema in
CU is caused by a non-specific histamine release from activated mast cells (32). The occurrence of angioedema in CU,
while not an indication for disease severity, is associated
with a longer duration of urticarial disease. Non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs and/or systemic corticotherapy are
classic triggers of angioedema in CU (33). Mast cells may be
activated primarily by IgE-dependent (allergen, anti-IgE) as
well as by IgE-independent mechanisms (34). Increased levels
of IgE are thought to provoke urticaria. Auto-antibodies for
IgE and the a-chain of FceRI contribute to the occurrence of
CU (35). It has been reported that one third of patients with

CU have significantly elevated levels of total IgE and levels
of serum total IgE are associated with disease severity and
duration (36). The severity of CSU was also identified to be
associated with a positive response in the ASST (37), which
is in accordance with the results of the present meta-analysis.

CSU is linked with thyroid diseases, which are the most
commonly reported autoimmune condition in patients
with CSU. Patients with thyroid dysfunction and CSU have
a more severe and prolonged course of urticaria than those
without thyroid dysfunction. A significantly greater number
of anti-thyroid antibodies are present in CSU patients. Even
in clinically euthyroid CSU patients, anti-thyroid antibodies
remain present and are considered to be associated with CSU.
Thyroid disease may worsen urticaria through activation of
the complement system (2).

CU is characterized by mast/basophil cell activation,
which initiates an inflammatory response. Sex hormones
modulate immune and inflammatory cell functions, including
mast cell secretion. Of note, urticaria may be associated with
certain diseases and conditions associated with hormonal
changes, including endocrinopathy, the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, menopause and hormonal contraceptives or hormone
replacement therapy. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a
modulator of endocrine and immune functions and depletion
of DHEA may lead to adverse events (38). Serum concentrations of DHEA sulfate in CSU patients are significantly lower
than those in healthy subjects and are associated with positive
responses to ASST (39). This is in accordance with the results
of the present meta-analysis, which indicate a female predominance for CSU and a positive response in the ASST (6-8,15).

Although the average NPV of the ASST was 92.8%, a
negative ASST was identified as a significant determinant
of urticaria remission and a negative ASST serves as a
good predictor for achieving urticaria remission within
2 years (8,14,40). A positive ASST response is a significant
predictor of CSU in controls (14).

While the studies included in the present meta-analyses
were selected based on strict inclusion and exclusion criteria,
certain unavoidable limitations and bias remain. As compared
2612

with a randomized controlled trial, the quality of observational studies is low, which represents a limitation of the
present meta-analysis. However, all subjects enrolled in the
present meta-analysis were patients with CU who voluntarily
underwent an ASST. The major observational endpoints
were UAS, serum total IgE and anti-thyroid autoantibodies,
all of which are objective parameters. Furthermore, all
of the studies included were on Asian populations, which
is a cause of publication bias. Although ASST has a high
specificity to test for functional autoantibodies, their absence
has a high specificity for CU. According to the European
expert consensus from 2009 (8), the value and meaning of
the ASST remains to be fully established. Furthermore, skin
testing requires the collection of venous blood and separation of serum prior to hypodermic injection. It is essential
that failsafe precautions are taken to ensure that the patient's
own serum is used for skin testing and aseptic procedures
are required. Commercial ELISA is now sufficiently mature
for testing for functional autoantibodies, including IgE. The
dermatologists of developed countries may be more likely
to identify anti-IgE antibodies using ELISA compared
with certain Asian dermatologists. An additional source
of potential bias may be differences within health care
providers and hospitals regarding the techniques applied for
detecting ASST and the conditions of the patients. Although
all studies included in the present review involved comparisons of/within case groups with positive and negative ASST
responses, inherent differences in researchers' approaches to,
and interpretations of, CSU may exist. Finally, the limited
sample size and resultant data available for the present
meta-analyses may have affected the final results obtained.
The conclusions require verification by subsequent studies
and the resolution of remaining issues.

In conclusion, the results of the present analyses of pooled
data indicate that CSU patients with a positive ASST response
have more severe clinical features and are more likely to have
an accompanying autoimmunity condition as compared with
those with a negative response to the ASST.
