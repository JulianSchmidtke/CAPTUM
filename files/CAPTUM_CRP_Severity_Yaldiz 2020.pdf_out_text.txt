Abstract

Introduction: Low grade inflammation is associated with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and atherosclerosis.
here are little data on the relationship between urticarial inflammation and atherosclerosis. The neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and mean platelet volume (MPV) have recently been studied in
many diseases as a biomarker of inflammation.

Aim: To evaluate hematologic inflammatory parameters and subclinical atherosclerosis in CSU patients.

Material and methods: C-reactive protein (CRP), NLR, PLR, MPV and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) in CSU
patients were compared with healthy controls. Thirty CSU patients and 30 healthy controls participated in the study.
Results: Thirty CSU patients and 30 healthy controls participated in the study. 53.3% of the patient group were females, 46.7% were males and the mean age was 37.7 +7.7. 53.3% of the healthy control group were females, 46.7%
were males and the mean age was 37.1 +7.2. Body mass index was 24.63 +2.7 kg/m’ in the patient group and 24.83
+2.5 kg/m?in the control group. Left and right CIMT and CRP values were higher in CSU patients and high-density
ipoproteins (HDL) values were lower in the CSU patients. There was a positive correlation between the right and left
CIMT and urticaria activity severity 4 (UAS4), disease severity, and triglycerides in the patient group, also a negative
correlation was found between the right and left CIMT and the HDL values. C-reactive protein was also correlated

 

with UAS4 and disease severity.

which are the ratio of neutrophil and platelet counts to
lymphocyte counts, are indicative of systemic inflammation and are associated with prognosis in many cardiovascular diseases, malignancies and chronic inflammatory diseases [1, 11-13]. Mean platelet volume (MPV) is
considered to be a marker of platelet function and activation, and high MPV values have been shown to be
independent risk factors for acute myocardial infarction.
In addition, it has been reported that MPV value is high in
some systemic inflammatory diseases and has a positive

 

correlation with CRP [14].
In recent years, the emphasis has been laid on the
measurement of carotid artery intima media thickness

(CIMT) with carotid artery ultrasound in the evaluation of
subclinical atherosclerosis. A CIMT increase is considered
to be a marker of atherosclerosis [15]. It was first identi
 

 

 

fied in 1986 by Pignoli et al. and there are many literature
studies available today [16, 17].
Chronic spontaneous urticaria patients have been

 

reported to have a significantly higher prevalence of the
metabolic syndrome when compared to the age-matched
control group [18]. The existence of metabolic syndrome
often increases the cardiovascular disease risk. Studies
show that diseases with chronic inflammation (psoriasis,
psoriatic arthritis, Behget’s disease, etc.) pose a risk in
terms of atherosclerosis [19].

 

 

Aim

There are little data on the relationship between urticarial inflammation, atherosclerosis and the cardiovascular disease risk. The aim of our study is to examine the
hematologic inflammatory marker (NLR, PLR, MPV) and
CRP levels in patients with CSU and to evaluate the risk
of subclinical atherosclerosis by measuring the thickness
of carotid intima media and to determine the correlation
of these findings with disease severity and duration.

 

 

Material and methods
Patients

Thirty CSU volunteer patients (15 ASST+, 15 ASST-)
who were followed-up in the chronic urticaria polyclinic
of the Ministry of Health Sakarya University Training
and Research Hospital and who met the inclusion criteria, and 30 healthy controls who came to the dermatology clinic for causes other than chronic inflammatory diseases and who have not had an urticaria attack
before they were enrolled in the study. A local ethics
committee approval was obtained before the study
(SUEK.16214662/05.01.04/82).

Patients and controls with classical cardiovascular
risks were excluded from the study. In addition, so were
those who have a history of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and peripheral artery disease, collagen tissue disease, systemic vasculitis, autoimmune diseases, thyroid

disease, systemic disease and malignancy, those who receive antihyperlipidemic, antihypertensive, antiaggregant,
anticoagulant, nitrate, estrogen and oral contraceptive
treatment, those who smoke and use alcohol, pregnant
women, those who are < 18 years of age and > 50 years of
age. Cardiovascular risk factors include hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg, diabetes mellitus (fasting blood glucose:
> 110 mg/dl), hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol > 240 mg/dl
and/or TG > 160 mg/dl), serum creatinine value > 1.3 mg/dl
and obesity (body mass index > 30 kg/m’).

Evaluation of disease severity

Urticaria activity score (UAS) was evaluated on the
day of blood-letting (rash number: no rash: 0, 1-10 wheals = 1, 11-50 wheals = 2, > 50 wheals = 3+ pruritus intensity: none: 0, mild: 1, moderate: 2, severe: 3; minimum
= 0, maximum = 24). UAS was graded as mild (1-8), moderate (9-16) and severe (17-24).

Autologous serum test

The autologous serum test was applied only to the
patient group on the sample blood-letting day. 0.05 ml
of autologous serum was given to the inner side of the
forearm. Similarly, sterile saline was applied at the same
dose as negative control. Thirty minutes after the application, an erythematous urticarial papule formation of
1.5 mm or greater from negative control was positively
evaluated.

Detailed anamnesis-taking and physical examination
of all patients were performed. Venous blood samples
were taken for hemogram, CRP, total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), fasting blood sugar, urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) determination.

 

Carotid artery Doppler US evaluation

Intima media thickness (IMT) measurement software
was used by the same radiologist for the measurement
of carotid artery intima media thickness of all subjects
included in the study with high resolution color Doppler
ultrasonography (Toshiba aplio 400, Otawara-shi, Japan)
with PLT-1204 BX transducer (7.2-14 MHz). Intima media
thickness was measured from CCA, Bulb and ICA levels
on both sides and carotid intima media thickness was
calculated by the device.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were evaluated using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences for Windows version
17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) program. Descriptive data
were expressed as mean + standard deviation, numbers
and percentages. Student’s t-test was used to compare
continuous data. y? test was used to compare categori

cal data. The relationship between continuous data was
evaluated by Pearson correlation test.

P< 0.05 value was considered as the level of significance. Negative values show an inverse correlation and
positive values show a positive correlation in the correlation evaluation.

Results

Thirty CSU patients and 30 healthy controls participated in the study. 53.3% of the patient group were females, 46.7% were males and the mean age was 37.7 +7.7.
53.3% of the healthy control group were females, 46.7%
were males and the mean age was 37.1 +7.2. Body mass
index (BMI) was 24.63 +2.7 kg/m? in the patient group
and 24.83 +2.5 kg/m? in the control group. The mean disease duration of chronic urticaria patients was determined as 40.24 +35.36 months. The average UAS was 16.87
+4.0. There was no statistically significant difference in
terms of age, sex and BMI distribution in both groups
(Table 1).

The HDL values were found to be significantly lower
in the CSU group as compared to healthy controls, but
there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of LDL, total cholesterol and triglicerydes
(TG) values. The CRP level was significantly higher in the
CSU group as compared to the control group, but there was no significant difference between two groups in
terms of MPV, platelets (PLT), NLR, and PLR. Right and
left CIMT scores were 0.54 +0.08, 0.53 +0.1 in the CSU
group and 0.48 +0.07, 0.46 +0.09 in the control group,
respectively. Right and left CIMT scores were found to be
statistically significantly increased in patients with CSU
compared to healthy controls (Table 2). There was no correlation between right and left CIMT and UAS4, duration
of the disease, disease severity, CRP, MPV, NLR, PLR, LDL,
total cholesterol and BMI in the patient group. However,
a significant positive but inverse correlation was found
between the right CIMT and the HDL value, and also
a significant and positive correlation with TG value. In
addition, there was a positive correlation between left
CIMT and TG value (Table 3).

A statistically significant correlation was determined
between CRP value and UAS and disease severity in the
patient group. There was also a significant positive but
inverse correlation between CRP and HDL values and
a significant positive correlation with TG value. However,
there was no correlation between duration of disease,

Discussion

We found that right and left CIMT values were statistically significantly higher in the CSU group as compared to the healthy control group and HDL values were
significantly lower in the CSU patients as compared to
the healthy control group and the CRP values were significantly higher in the CSU patient group. There was
also a statistically significant positive correlation between CRP value and UAS, disease severity, and TG in the
patient group, and a significant but inverse correlation
with HDL In addition, there was a significant but inverse
correlation between right CIMT and HDL value, and a significant and positive correlation between right and left
CIMT and TG value.

protein produced by main hepatocytes under the influence of cytokines such as TNF-a and IL-6 [20]. Danesh et al.

to evaluate PLR in CSU. Similar MPV values determined

technical reasons and from different criteria used in the
classification of patients. Especially in retrospective analyses, it may be due to failure to apply exclusion criteria
including DM, HT, obesity, smoking, arterial and autoimmune disease. Lately, almost all diseases can increase or
reduce MPV. Therefore, the practical possibility of excluding MPV-related diseases and conditions completely is

difficult.

 

We did not find NLR, PLR and MPV values in CSU pa
tients to be similar to those of healthy controls and not
to be associated with CRP and disease severity in the
CSU patient group. We therefore believe that MPV, NLR
and PLR values are insufficient data for evaluating inflammation and disease severity in CSU. However, there
is a need for more larger-scale prospective studies on the

 

use of these parameters in CSU.

 

 

Studies show that skin diseases with chronic inflammation such as psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis pose a risk
of atherosclerosis [19, 32]. Inflammation has an important
role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis
and circulatory diseases. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory and immunological disease in which many
cells, including monocytes, macrophages, T lymphocytes,

 

endotheli

cells, smooth muscle cells and mast cells, are

hil, and neutrophil infil
tration [1]. It has been shown that low-grade inflammation
is associated with atherosclerosis and CSU. TNF-a, IL-1-IL-2,
IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18 are shown to be cytokines responsible
for atherosclerotic plaque formation [4]. Increase in IL-6,

levels were also observed

in CSU patients [8—10, 33, 34]. Moreover, it is assumed that

und healing angiogenesis. There is considerable evidence
that mast cells play a key role in inflammation and that
their products regulate inflammatory mediator production
[35]. In recent years, mast cells have been shown in atherosclerotic plaque development and inflammatory disease
processes such as cardiovascular disease, hyperlipidemia
[36-38]. The mast cells present in the human arterial intima may be degranulated after stimulation and secrete
the chymase inhibiting HDL apolipoprotein and delay cellular cholesterol flow. In fact, Lee et al. [39] have reported
that mast cell chymase disrupts and decreases the level of
APOA-1, the major HDL apolipoprotein that changes lipid
metabolism.

In addition, the clinical effects and prevalence of metabolic syndrome among CSU patients was investigated
in a hospital-based comparative cross-sectional study of
131 CSU patients and a higher prevalence of metabolic
syndrome have been found in CSU patients [18]. They
have reported that the presence of the metabolic syndrome in the logistic regression analysis correlated with
a high urticaria activity score and that it was an independent risk factor for uncontrolled CSU. In another community-based cross-sectional study of 11261 CSU patients,
the relationship between CSU and the metabolic syndrome has been investigated and in univariate analysis CSU
has been found to be associated with higher metabolic
syndrome and its components which are DM, obesity, hyperlipidemia and hypertension prevalences [40].

In recent studies, the measurement of intima media
thickness with carotid artery USG, which is an inexpensive, simple and easily acceptable method for evaluating
subclinical atherosclerosis, has been focused on [41]. Intima media thickness increase is considered as an atherosclerosis marker [15]. 0.1 mm increase in CIMT increases
the myocardial infarction risk by 10-15% and the stroke
risk by 13-18% [42].

In the light of this, it can be argued that when CSU is
considered as an inflammatory disease, these patients
may have an increased risk of atherosclerosis. In our
study, we found that the values of right and left carotid
intima media thickness were statistically significantly higher and the HDL value was significantly lower in CSU
patients who did not have any known cardiovascular risk
factor compared to the healthy control group. There was
also an inverse correlation between CRP value and HDL
and a positive correlation between these and TG in the
CSU group. These findings support that there may be an
increased risk of atherosclerosis in CSU patients. Our study is the first in the literature to investigate subclinical
atherosclerosis in CSU patients. Having a small number
of samples is the limiting factor of our study.

of NLR, MPV and PLR in evaluating CSU inflammation

there is a need for larger-scale prospective studies on the

to our results, impairment of lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis may be an increased trend in CSU patients,
