Background: Few data are available that describe response
patterns in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU)/
chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) treated with omalizumab.
Objective: We sought to describe response patterns by using
data from the 3 pivotal omalizumab CIU/CSU trials.
Methods: Every 4 weeks, randomized patients received dosing
with placebo or 75, 150, or 300 mg of omalizumab (ASTERIA I:
n = 318, 24 weeks; ASTERIA II: n = 322, 12 weeks) or placebo or
300 mg of omalizumab (GLACIAL: n = 335, 24 weeks). Response
was defined as well-controlled urticaria (weekly Urticaria
Activity Score [UAS7] < 6) or complete response (UAS7 = 0).
Results: Response rates were dose dependent and highest with
300 mg of omalizumab. Some patients responded early (before
week 4). At week 12, a higher proportion of patients treated
with 300 mg of omalizumab reported a UAS7 < 6 (26.0% [75 mg
of omalizumab], 40.0% [150 mg of omalizumab], 51.9% [300 mg
of omalizumab], and 11.3% [placebo] for ASTERIA I; 26.8%
[75 mg of omalizumab], 42.7% [150 mg of omalizumab], 65.8%
[300 mg of omalizumab], and 19.0% [placebo] for ASTERIA I;
and 52.4% [300 mg of omalizumab] and 12.0% [placebo] for
GLACIAL) or a UAS7 = 0 (11.7% [75 mg of omalizumab],
15.0% [150 mg of omalizumab], 35.8% [300 mg of omalizumab],
and 8.8% [placebo] for ASTERIA I; 15.9% [75 mg of

omalizumab], and 5.1% [placebo] for ASTERIA II; and 33.7%
[300 mg of omalizumab] and 4.8% [placebo] for GLACIAL). In
patients receiving 300 mg of omalizumab with 24 weeks of
treatment, median time to achieve a UAS7 < 6 was 6 weeks
(ASTERIA I and GLACIAL) and median time to achieve a
UAS7 = 0 was 12 or 13 weeks (ASTERIA I and GLACIAL,
respectively). Some patients who achieved well-controlled
urticaria or complete response sustained response throughout
the treatment period.

Conclusion: Benefits of omalizumab treatment were evident
early (before week 4) in some patients and persisted to week 24.
Use of 300 mg of omalizumab demonstrated best results in
controlling CIU/CSU symptoms. (J Allergy Clin Immunol

Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU)/chronic spontaneous
urticaria (CSU) is a condition characterized by spontaneous
appearance of pruritic hives, angioedema, or both that recur
without an identifiable external cause and persist for 6 weeks or
longer.’ CIU/CSU is a rare condition, and its prevalence was
reported to range between 0.6% and 0.8% in the general
population of Spain and Germany." Patients with CIU/CSU
report substantial worsening of health-related quality of life.°*

The Urticaria Activity Score (UAS) is a validated measure to
assess disease activity in patients with CIU/CSU. The UAS score
(range, 0-6) comprises a sum of daily ratings for itch severity and
number of hives (0-3 points for each). The weekly Urticaria
Activity Score (UAS7) sums UAS scores during a 7-day period,
and possible values for the UAS7 range from 0 to 42. US and
European guidelines recommended evaluating disease activity
and response to treatment in routine clinical practice.**

The 2014 CIU/CSU guidelines for the United States and
Europe~* recommend treating CIU/CSU in a stepwise manner,
starting with monotherapy with a second-generation antihistamine.” However, complete response to H,-antihistamines has
been reported to reach slightly greater than 50% in patients
with CIU/CSU.' Although the next steps vary slightly between
guidelines, recommendations include increasing the dose of
H,-antihistamine up to 4-fold and/or adding other therapies,
such as H>-antihistamines or leukotriene receptor antagonists
(LTRAs). Should lack of control continue, guidelines recommend
using omalizumab.?*

Data from 3 phase III clinical trials (ASTERIA I, ASTERIA II,
and GLACIAL) demonstrated the efficacy and safety of

omalizumab to treat patients with CIU/CSU.”'' Despite the
positive results of these trials, many clinical questions remain
regarding the response to omalizumab in patients with CIU/
CSU. The expected timing of response to omalizumab has not
been previously reported. Furthermore, published data do not
provide guidance on how many doses might be needed to define
response or lack of response.

The aim of this analysis was to investigate response patterns
of omalizumab to treat CIU/CSU in the phase III clinical trial
data, with a goal of providing a practical approach to omalizumab use for clinicians by using omalizumab in the real-world
setting.

METHODS

Phase III omalizumab studies

ASTERIA I,'' ASTERIA II,!° and GLACIAL’ were phase III, global,
randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials
designed to assess the efficacy and safety of omalizumab use in patients
with CIU/CSU.

ASTERIA I and ASTERIA II enrolled patients with CIU/CSU who
remained symptomatic despite treatment with H,-antihistamines at approved
doses. Enrolled patients in both studies had to have a UAS7 > 16 (equivalent
to moderate-to-severe CIU/CSU symptoms on at least 4 of 7 days”) and an itch
component UAS7 (range, 0-21) > 8 for the 7 days before randomization.
Enrolled patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive omalizumab (75, 150,
or 300 mg) or placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 6 (ASTERIA I) or
3 (ASTERIA II) doses. In both studies, patients were observed for an additional 16 weeks without therapy. In ASTERIA I, patients were allowed to
change their background medication after week 12. The primary efficacy
end point in both studies assessed the mean change in weekly itch severity
score from baseline to week 12. The studies also evaluated the proportion of
patients who achieved well-controlled urticaria (UAS7 <6; secondary analysis
in both studies) and the proportion of patients who achieved complete
response (UAS7 = 0; secondary analysis in ASTERIA I and post hoc analysis
in ASTERIA II) at week 12. Additional details of the ASTERIA I and
ASTERIA II study designs have been published elsewhere.'°'!!

GLACIAL was a phase III, global, randomized, multicenter, double-blind,
placebo-controlled clinical trial that assessed the safety and efficacy of
omalizumab use in patients with CIU/CSU. H-antihistamines had failed at
up to 4 times the recommended dose plus H>-antihistamines, LTRAs, or
both in GLACIAL-enrolled patients. Enrolled patients were randomized 3:1
to receive 300 mg of omalizumab or placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks
for 6 doses. The primary end point in this study was the safety of 300 mg of
omalizumab versus placebo. The key efficacy end point included the change
in the weekly itch severity score from baseline to week 12, the proportion of
patients with well-controlled urticaria (UAS7 < 6) at week 12, and the
proportion of patients with complete response (UAS7 = 0) at week 12.
Additional details of the GLACIAL study design have been published by
Kaplan et al.”

All 3 studies were conducted in accordance with US Food and Drug
Administration regulations, the International Conference on Harmonisation
E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and any other applicable laws.
Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained
from all patients. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov

Data collection and assessments

Patients used an electronic handheld device (eDiary) to record data twice
daily for the validated Urticaria Patient Daily Diary.'~'’ These data informed
the primary and many secondary end points from study patients in all 3 phase
Ill studies of omalizumab. The Urticaria Patient Daily Diary includes
questions about itch severity and number of hives (to assess UAS), largest
hive size, sleep interference, daily activity interference, diphenhydramine
(rescue medication use), angioedema episodes and management, and health
provider contact for CIU/CSU-related issues. Patients reported itch severity
twice daily on a scale from 0 to 3 (0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; and 3, severe).
Patients also reported the number of hives twice daily on a scale from 0 to 3 (0,
none; 1, between | and 6 hives; 2, between 7 and 12 hives; and 3, >12 hives).

Definitions of response

The following definitions of response to treatment were based on the UAS7:
either complete response (itch and hive free, UAS7 = 0) or well-controlled
urticaria (UAS7 < 6). By design, the well-controlled urticaria group also
included complete responders.

the proportion of weeks in the active treatment period during which
patients experienced their responses; this analysis was performed for all
patients. We estimated the percentage of patients who achieved a
response they later sustained through the end of the drug administration
period. The x” test was used to compare all percentages in the conducted

analyses. Median time to achieve first response was calculated using
the Kaplan-Meier method; time to achieve first response was compared
between treatment groups by using the log-rank test. All statistics
were calculated with SAS 9.2 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Missing UAS7 data at week 12 resulted in patients imputed as

RESULTS
Patient demographics

In the following 3 phase III studies of omalizumab in patients
with CIU/CSU, a total of 975 patients were randomized an
received at least 1 dose of study drug: ASTERIA I (75 mg of
omalizumab [n = 77], 150 mg of omalizumab [n = 80], 300 mg of
omalizumab [n = 81], and placebo [n = 80]); ASTERIA II
(75 mg of omalizumab [n = 82], 150 mg of omalizumab [n = 82],
300 mg of omalizumab [n = 79], and placebo [n = 79]); an
GLACIAL (300 mg of omalizumab [n = 252] and placebo
[n = 83]). Baseline patient characteristics in the studies were
similar (Table I).”'' Most of the patients in each study were
white, and the majority were female. The average age range
from 41.2 years (ASTERIA I) to 43.1 years (GLACIAL), an
the baseline Chronic Urticaria Index was negative (<10) for
most patients (69% [GLACIAL] to 75% [ASTERIA I]).
Patients’ baseline characteristic data have been publishe
elsewhere.” ''

 

Responders

Response at different time points. At week 4, after a
single dose of study drug, well-controlled urticaria (UAS7 < 6)
was reported by 5%, 12%, 21%, and 37% of patients in ASTERIA
I (placebo and 75, 150, or 300 mg of omalizumab, respectively);
13%, 15%, 28%, and 51% of patients in ASTERIA II (placebo
and 75, 150, or 300 mg of omalizumab, respectively); and 2%
and 37% of patients in GLACIAL (placebo and 300 mg of
omalizumab, respectively). At week 4, a complete response
(UAS7 = 0) was noted in 1%, 5%, 6%, and 19% of patients in
ASTERIA I (placebo and 75, 150, or 300 mg of omalizumab,
respectively); 0%, 4%, 6%, and 24% of patients in ASTERIA II
(placebo and 75, 150, or 300 mg of omalizumab, respectively);
and 0% and 15% of patients in GLACIAL (placebo and 300 mg of
omalizumab, respectively). The percentage of well-controlled
urticaria (UAS7 <6) and complete responders (UAS7 = 0) during
the active treatment period increased with continued dosing
(Fig 1). The 300-mg dose of omalizumab produced the highest
response rates among all study arms.

Patients in ASTERIA I and GLACIAL continued to receive
therapy beyond week 12. With continued dosing, some patients
who had not met the definitions of response at week 12 met those
definitions at week 24: ASTERIA I (45.7%, 34.4%, and 58.1%,
respectively, of the 75-, 150-, and 300-mg arms and 38.2% of the
placebo arm) and GLACIAL (48.9% in the 300-mg omalizumab
arm and 14.3% in the placebo arm; Fig 2).

 

Median time to achieve response. Of 12 weeks of active
treatment (ASTERIA II), the median time to achieve
well-controlled urticaria (UAS7 < 6) was 8, 7, and 3 weeks (75,
150, and 300 mg of omalizumab, respectively); fewer than 50% of
placebo patients achieved a UAS7 < 6 within the first 12 weeks of
active treatment, and therefore a median time to the end point
could not be calculated. In the same study, median time to achieve
complete response (UAS7 = 0) was 8 weeks for patients
receiving 300 mg of omalizumab; fewer than 50% of patients in
other treatment arms achieved a UAS7 = 0 within the 12-week
period.

Of 24 weeks of treatment, the median time to achieve
well-controlled urticaria (UAS7 < 6) was 11 and 6 weeks
(150 and 300 mg of omalizumab, respectively; ASTERIA I)
and 6 weeks (300 mg of omalizumab, GLACIAL; Fig 3); in other
treatment arms, fewer than 50% of patients achieved the outcome
by week 24. The median time to achieve complete response
(UAS7 = 0) was 12 and 13 weeks (300 mg of omalizumab;
ASTERIA I and GLACIAL, respectively; Fig 3); in other
treatment arms fewer than 50% of patients achieved the outcome
by week 24. Of the patients being treated with 300 mg of
omalizumab who had not achieved well-controlled urticaria
(UAS7 < 6) as of week 12, 58% achieved it between weeks 13
and 24. In contrast, of the patients receiving placebo who had
not achieved well-controlled urticaria as of week 12, 38%
achieved it between weeks 13 and 24.

Length of response. The proportion of weeks in the active
treatment (the first 12 weeks in ASTERIA IJ and the first 24 weeks
in ASTERIA I and GLACIAL) period during which patients
experienced response was highest in the 300-mg omalizumab
treatment arm (Fig 4). To calculate this outcome, we summed the
total number of weeks during which patients reported a response
and divided it by the total number of patient-weeks in the arm.
This effect was consistent in all 3 studies.

Sustained response. Sustained response was defined as
instances when patients who achieved well-controlled urticaria
(UAS7 < 6) or complete response (UAS7 = 0) maintained that
response through the rest of the active treatment period (week 12
[ASTERIA II] and week 24 [ASTERIA I and GLACIAL]; Fig 5).
In the 300-mg omalizumab arms, more patients achieved sustained
responses and did so earlier than patients in other treatment arms.

treatment before at least 3 omalizumab doses might miss an
opportunity to bring their CIU/CSU symptoms under control.
Overall, these results might help health care providers by setting
expectations of likelihood of response at different time points
after initiation of omalizumab.

Despite different background therapies in GLACIAL, which
allowed patients to receive higher doses of H,-antihistamines and
other background therapies (Hj blockers and LTRAs) than in
ASTERIA I and II, patients’ response patterns were comparable
among the 3 studies analogous to the similarities in efficacy
previously noted.’ All studies had patients who responded after
the first 3 doses. In all 3 studies, response manifested in a
dose-dependent manner, with the likelihood of response
increasing in patients receiving higher doses. Patients receiving
300 mg of omalizumab had a higher rate of response, and more
of them sustained their response than in other treatment arms.
Response patterns in weeks 13 to 24 were similar in ASTERIA
Tand GLACIAL.

The timing of well-controlled and complete response suggests
that there might be 2 categories of responders to omalizumab:
those who respond early (before week 4) and those who require
more than 3 monthly doses to respond. The median time to
complete response was observed between 8 and 10 weeks for
300 mg of omalizumab. Early onset of omalizumab efficacy has
been reported in patients with CIU/CSU and other disease areas.
Lin et al'° followed 24 patients with adult allergic rhinitis treated
with omalizumab (0.016 mg/kg per IgE [IU/mL)) or placebo for
6 weeks. Decreases in IgE levels were reported as early as 3 days
in patients treated with omalizumab, and basophil FceRI receptor
activity was significantly reduced by day 7 and further decreased
by day 42.'° Pereira Santos et al'’ followed 2 patients with severe
uncontrolled asthma who were given 300 mg of omalizumab
every 2 weeks for | year; serial assessments of FceRI expression
on basophils were performed. The reduction in FceRI expression
was maximized mostly within the first month of treatment,
although some additional small reductions were reported during
the subsequent year of treatment. In the study by Metz et al,”
30 adults with CIU/CSU were randomized to receive omalizumab
or placebo every 4 weeks for 12 weeks. FceRI* skin cell numbers
decreased in omalizumab-treated patients by day 8 and continued
to do so by day 85.'" Metz et al'® reported that among 51 patients
with chronic urticaria, 12 gained complete response within
1 week, and 6 patients did so within 4 weeks of the first
omalizumab injection. Although the early responders in our
study follow these findings, the mechanism to explain the late
responders is not completely clear.

J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL
mmm 2015,

Our findings of a subpopulation of patients with CIU/CSU with
a late response to omalizumab concur with data published by
Uysal et al.'” The authors individualized omalizumab doses and
dosing intervals to treat patients with different types of urticaria:
CIU/CSU (85%), delayed pressure urticaria (22%), urticaria
factitia (11%), contact urticaria (7%), and heat contact urticaria
(7%).'° This small single-arm open-label study included 27
patients with urticaria (aged 10-65 years) who were started on
150 mg of omalizumab. In 2 weeks, physicians evaluated each
patient’s condition and prescribed the next dose based on how
the patient responded. Approximately 56% (15/27) of patients
reached a UAS > 2 after a single 150-mg omalizumab dose and
stayed in this dose category, and the remaining patients (12/27)
received 300 mg of omalizumab at week 3 and remained in this
dose category.

In the “time to response” analyses, after week 12, the
Kaplan-Meier curves of the placebo and 300-mg omalizumab
groups demonstrated apparently similar slopes. By week 12,
many of the patients in the 300-mg omalizumab group had
already achieved a response (well-controlled urticaria or
complete response). Therefore, the group had begun to reach a
ceiling beyond which further improvement was difficult. This was
most noticeable in the patients who achieved well-controlled
urticaria (UAS7 < 6). However, when examining only patients
who had an opportunity for improvement, we see that the
percentage of patients who had not achieved a UAS7 < 6 at
week 12 but responded as such during weeks 13 to 24 was 58% in
the 300-mg omalizumab group and 38% in the placebo group.
The study was not powered to detect this end point of
improvement after 12 weeks among patients not yet achieving
response, and statistical tests comparing such end points were not
performed among this small sample; thus we are not able to draw
any strong conclusions regarding later responses to omalizumab.

Although the definitions of response were prespecified
outcomes in ASTERIA I and II and GLACIAL,”!! the authors
are not aware of any formal definition of response to treatment
(with any medication) for patients with CIU/CSU. The state
of well-controlled urticaria (UAS7 < 6) is a reasonable and
clinically relevant threshold because it requires patients to be
well-controlled with only minimal symptoms. Complete response
(UAS7 = 0), which connotes complete elimination of itch and
hives, stands out as an attractive clinical objective but is often
difficult to achieve. Regardless of the responder definition, the
300-mg dose of omalizumab demonstrated the best outcomes.
Therefore, it might be reasonable to initiate treatment with the
300-mg dose to ensure best outcomes for the patients.

Data from this analysis might inform decisions regarding an
approach to evaluating response to omalizumab treatment.
Knowledge of expected response to omalizumab therapy might
assist prescribers in determining the length of a therapeutic trial
and inform patients or prescribers as to what to expect from
omalizumab therapy. Setting patients’ expectations regarding the
risks and benefits of a therapy can improve adherence to a
treatment regimen and contribute to optimization of outcomes.”°

Continued investigation into time to response, identification of
specific phenotypes in response to omalizumab, and length of
treatment will be important to prescribers who have patients who
require omalizumab for management of CIU/CSU. Improving our
understanding of the activity of omalizumab in the inflammatory
process associated with symptomatic CIU/CSU and recognizing
that a subset of patients might have a delay in response could also

therapy.

Although phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trials remain the gold standard for establishing efficacy,

the results of this analysis should be interpreted in light of its
limitations. Clinical trial data were not available beyond week 24,
and therefore information on the response to treatment beyond this
time is unknown. Results from a phase II dose-ranging study
8 KAPLAN ET AL

provided the framework for the flat dosing (non-IgE and
non-weight-based dosing) and 4-week interval used in the pivotal
studies.*' Despite evidence from the phase II and 3 phase III
proof-of-concept studies, ”'' it must be acknowledged that we still
have much to learn about optimal dosing of omalizumab in
patients with CIU/CSU. On the basis of Genentech’s data on
file, we also know that the patients in the placebo arm used
more background therapy than patients in the omalizumab arm.
Therefore, such misbalance is likely to have unfavorably
affected omalizumab arms, as opposed to the placebo arm. In
addition, these studies permitted the use of rescue medication
(diphenhydramine), and our analysis did not control for rescue
medication use. Finally, the comparison arm of these studies
included placebo plus standard of care and thus was not a pure
untreated placebo arm.

Although this study highlighted 2 categories of responders
(ie, early and late) the exact mechanisms responsible for these
responses are not completely clear. In addition, some patients
experienced relapse of their symptoms during either the treatment
or follow-up periods. Understanding patterns in relapses might
help physicians effectively dose omalizumab in their practice,
although relapse analysis was outside the scope of this study.
Further research is needed to understand characteristics
predictive of early versus late response, as well as relapse patterns
in patients with CIU/CSU treated with omalizumab.

In summary, response patterns to treatment of CIU/CSU with
omalizumab were dose dependent; use of the 300-mg dose of
omalizumab resulted in the largest percentage of patients who
achieved a complete response (UAS7 = 0) or well-controlled
urticaria (UAS7 < 6). Half of the patients treated with 300 mg of
omalizumab had well-controlled symptoms after 2 injections
(median time to response, 6 weeks). The benefits of omalizumab
treatment in patients with CIU/CSU were evident to week 24.
These data highlight the likelihood of response to omalizumab in
patients with CIU/CSU at different time points and will help
prescribers set patients’ expectations for therapy.

We thank the clinical trial investigators, staff, and patients who participated
in the studies. Medical writing support was provided by Linda Wagner,
PharmD, of Excel Scientific Solutions and funded by Genentech, Inc and
Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.

Clinical implications: In patients with CIU/CSU, response to
omalizumab was dose dependent; treatment with 300 mg of

omalizumab resulted in earlier response (before week 4), and
response was sustained to week 24.
