Background: Staphylococcus aureus (SA) has peculiar
abilities to colonize the skin in atopic dermatitis (AD)
patients. Objective: We sought to determine the colonization rates of SA in acute and chronic skin lesions of AD
patients, to find any difference in colonization rates according to age and to find the influences of total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and eosinophil counts to the colonization of
SA. Methods: We evaluated the total IgE level and eosinophil
counts, and cultured SA from the skin lesions of 687 AD
patients (131 acute and 556 chronic skin lesions) and 247
control urticaria patients (July 2009 to November 2010;
Samsung Medical Center Dermatology Clinic, Seoul, Korea).
Results: The SA colonization rates were 74%, 38% and 3%
in acute, chronic skin lesions and control skin, respectively,
and they were increased with age in AD patients. The
colonization rate in chronic skin lesions was higher in the
high IgE/eosinophilia groups as compared to the normal
IgE/eosinophil groups. Conclusion: The SA colonization rate
was higher in AD patients and especially in acute lesions,
and had a tendency to increase with age. As the colonization
rates were only higher in the high IgE/eosinophilia groups of
chronic skin lesions, we suggested that SA may invade the
skin through barrier defects in acute skin lesions, but the

INTRODUCTION

 

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin
disease and it has been classified into two different subtypes; classic age-matched subtyping (infantile, childhood,
and adult) and presence/absence of allergy (extrinsic AD
and intrinsic AD). Lesions can be classified as acute or
chronic according to the skin status and differences in
cytokine expressions of the lesional skin.

In addition to the presence or absence of sensitization
to allergens, AD patients often have impaired skin barrier
functions, display significant decreases in the expressions
of antimicrobial peptides (AMP) and exhibit innate immune defects, which explain their increased susceptibility to
secondary skin infections due to bacteria, fungi or viruses.

Of all the infectious agents found to affect AD patients,
the best-characterized is Staphylococcus aureus. The prevalence of S. aureus skin colonization in healthy individuals is 5% to 30%, while 75% to 100% of AD patients
have S. aureus on their lesional skin and 30% to 100% of
AD patients have this bacteria on their nonlesional skin™.
A correlation between the severity of eczema and colonization with S$. aureus has been demonstrated, which
means that bacterial colonization is an important mechanism in the aggravation of skin lesions®”. Despite the
conflicting data, several studies have demonstrated that
treatment of S. aureus can decrease the severity of eczema

 
in AD patients®’. Subjects with severe AD are considered
to be more susceptible to S. aureus colonization because
they have both innate and adaptive immune defects°.

Th2 polarity with excess production of Th2 cytokines
(interleukin [IL]-4, IL-5 and IL-13) may be a key factor in
the epithelial production of fibronectin and fibrinogen,
which can act as substrates for S$. aureus adherence’.
There is growing evidence suggesting that this Th2 polarity may adversely affect the innate immune response in
the skin of AD patients by inhibiting the productions of
AMP and the antimicrobial chemokine MIP3 @ (CCL20)'°"'.
Additionally, increased levels of Th2 cytokines inhibit the
eratinocyte mobilization of HBD-3'*. Therefore, biomarers for Th2 polarity such as serum total immunoglobulin
E (IgE) and eosinophil counts can be associated with S.
aureus superinfection. Warner et al.'? reported that there
was a significantly higher IgE level and greater number of
eosinophils in patients with S. aureus colonization than in
patients without colonization.

We evaluated laboratory parameters including serum IgE
and blood eosinophil counts, and also cultured S. aureus
rom the skin lesions of AD patients and from the control
urticaria patients. We reviewed our data to determine (1)
the colonization rates of S$. aureus in acute and chronic
skin lesions of AD patients and compared them with those
of non-AD patients for (2) whether there are differences in
the colonization rates according to age, (3) whether Th2
polarity markers (serum total IgE and eosinophil counts)
can influence the colonization rates of 5. aureus in
different age groups and different lesional states.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

 

We recruited 687 AD patients (188 infants, 267 children,
and 232 adults; 131 acute skin lesions and 556 chronic
skin lesions) and 247 control urticaria patients without any
skin lesions, including AD or psoriasis, from July 2009 to
November 2010. All the patients were examined at the
Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, Korea) Dermatology
Clinic. Subjects with clinically obvious infections such as
impetigo, furuncles or cellulitis were excluded. All the
participants did not take any medication during the past 2
weeks. The demographic information is summarized in
Table 1.

This study was conducted according to the Declaration of
Helsinki, and written informed consent was obtained from
all participants. The Samsung Medical Center Ethics
Committee approved this study (IRB 2009-12-053-006).

Laboratory markers

Serum total IgE level and blood eosinophil count were
measured for all subjects with AD and the control
patients. Serum total IgE were measured by ImmunoCAP™ fluorescence enzyme linked assay (Phadia AB,
Uppsala, Sweden) and blood eosinophil counts by XE2100 laser optical flow cytometry (Sysmex Corp., Kobe,
Japan). Threshold levels indicative of significances were
defined as follows: serum total IgE =100 kU L" for the
infant group, and =200 kU L' for the child and adult
groups, and total eosinophil count =300 cells mm” for
the infant group, and =500 cells mm” for the child and
adult groups.

Isolation and identification of Staphylococcus aureus
from atopic dermatitis skin

Subjects with clinically obvious infections, such as impetigo, furuncles or cellulitis, were excluded. We
classified the lesions of AD patients into acute and chronic
lesions; the acute eczematous lesions were defined by
erythema, crusting and oozing; and chronic lesions
manifested as papules and lichenification. Bacterial cultures were performed by rubbing rayon-tipped swabs over
the lesions (acute skin lesion or antecubital fossa) of the
AD patients and on the intertriginous areas of the urticaria
patients after cleaning with normal saline. Staphylococcal
strains were isolated on blood agar plates and identified as
S. aureus using a catalase test and a slide coagulase test.

Statistical analysis

Homogeneity of S. aureus colonization rates across
different age groups was analyzed using the x’ test.
Simple or multiple logistic regressions, which was developed to analyze data of binary responses, were used to
test for associations of one or multiple factors of diagnostic
measurements (serum total IgE level, total eosinophil
count and age) and S. aureus colonization rates. We used
the significance level of 5% and used SAS (SAS 9.2; SAS
Institute, Cary, NC, USA) to conduct the statistical
analysis. The 95% confidence intervals of the odds ratios
were also used for calculating the results of logistic
regression’.

RESULTS

 

Patterns of Staphylococcus aureus colonization

There was a statistically significant difference in S. aureus
colonization rates of AD patients and controls with
urticaria (9<0.0001). Colonization rates were 74.0%
(97/131) in acute skin lesions of AD patients, 37.9%

(211/556) in chronic lesions of AD patients, and 3.2%
(8/247) in urticaria patients (Table 2).

When we compared the S. aureus colonization rates in
different age groups, we also observed statistically
significant differences in both acute and chronic lesions of
AD patients (Table 2). The colonization rates in the infant,
child, and adult groups were 50.0% (18/36), 80.0%
(44/55) and 87.5% (35/40), respectively, for acute skin
lesions, and 18.5% (28/151), 41.8% (90/215) and 48.9%
(93/190) for chronic skin lesions. This revealed a tendency
for the S. aureus colonization rate to increase with age (0?
test, acute lesions: p=0.0004; chronic lesions: p< 0.0001).

The influences of elevated serum total immunoglobulin
E level and the presence of eosinophilia on Staphylococcus aureus colonization rate in atopic dermatitis
patients

As serum total IgE levels and eosinophil counts have been
reported to influence the S. aureus colonization", we also
compared the S. aureus colonization rates according to
those parameters. When comparing the colonization
results of the elevated serum total IgE group and the
normal serum total IgE group, the AD patients in the
elevated serum IgE group showed higher S. aureus
colonization rates than the normal serum total IgE group
with acute and chronic skin lesions. However, the
correlation was statistically less significant in acute skin
lesions (acute lesion: 81.1% vs. 64.9%, p=0.0387;
chronic lesion: 52.8% vs. 23.9%, p<0.0001). Although
the number of 5. aureus-positive patients in the urticaria
group was small, the elevated total IgE group did not have
increased S. aureus colonization rates. Nevertheless, the
urticaria patients with elevated total IgE showed decreased
S. aureus colonization rates when compared to the normal
total IgE group (Table 3A).

When we compared the colonization results according to
the eosinophil counts in the chronic lesion group, the
patients with eosinophilia showed significantly increased

The combined effects of elevated serum total immunoglobulin E and eosinophilia on Staphylococcus aureus
colonization rate in atopic dermatitis patients with
acute lesions

As serum total IgE or eosinophilia alone showed a
significant result only in the chronic skin lesion group, we
analyzed the combined effects of elevated serum total IgE
level and eosinophilia according to S. aureus colonization
rate (Table 4). We classified the patients into four groups:
the first group had elevated serum total IgE with
eosinophilia, the second group had elevated serum total
IgE without eosinophilia, the third group had eosinophilia
with normal serum IgE, and the fourth group had normal
serum IgE and no eosinophilia.

In the acute skin lesion group, the colonization rates of S.
aureus of AD patients in the four groups were 75.5%
(37/49), 92.0% (23/25), 65.5% (19/29) and 64.3% (18/28),
respectively, and there were no statistically significant
differences among these groups (Table 4A, Fig. 1A). We
also tested these two parameters to the S. aureus
colonization rates of AD patients in the different age
groups via multiple logistic regressions and found
influential effects on S. aureus colonization among the age
groups (p =0.00208).

Although we did not detect any statistical significance
between these two laboratory parameters and S. aureus
colonization in acute skin lesions, we observed a
tendency for the S. aureus colonization rate to increase
with age.

The combined effects of elevated serum total immunoglobulin E level and eosinophilia on Staphylococcus
aureus colonization rate in atopic dermatitis patients
with chronic lesions

In chronic skin lesions of AD patients, the colonization
rates of S. aureus in the four groups were 60.0% (57/95),
48.9% (81/176), 39.3% (22/56), and 20.0% (46/229),
respectively, and there were significant intergroup differences (Table 4B, Fig. 1B). These data revealed that
either serum total IgE or eosinophilia can affect the S.
aureus colonization as shown in Table 3, and these two
parameters showed additive effects on S. aureus colonization in chronic skin lesions of AD patients.

We then compared our results according to age groups.
The results for the four groups were 25.0%, 16.7%, 34.1%
and 9.5% in infants; 58.0%, 50.8%, 55.6% and 25.8% in
children; and 75.8%, 56.0%, 50.0%, and 24.2% in adults.
According to these results, only the adult group showed
similar results to those of total chronic AD skin lesion.

DISCUSSION

 

S. aureus is a well-known, Gram-positive bacteria, and the
prevalence of S. aureus skin colonization in healthy
individuals is 5% to 30%'*, and those in AD patients is
much higher for lesional and nonlesional skin. Acute skin
lesions of AD are colonized with greater numbers of S.
aureus than the chronic nonlesional skin’, and the density
of S. aureus has been shown to be correlated with the
degree of cutaneous inflammation and the severity of the
AD lesion®. We measured the S. aureus skin colonization

there are four categories among samples. Values of colonization rates are from colonization rates from (A) acute lesion and (B) chronic
lesion combined with serum total IgE and eosinophil counts. In chronic lesions, we can see clearly decreasing patterns of colonization
rates as the level of each factor is decreasing while there are weakly decreasing patterns in acute lesions.

rate for Korean AD patients and confirmed that our results
were similar to previous data. AD patients with acute skin
lesions showed a higher colonization rate (74%) than AD
patients with chronic skin lesions (38%). We also found
that the S. aureus colonization rates were increased with
age in both lesions of AD. A previous study conducted in
Sri Lanka showed that the S. aureus colonization rates in
acute lesions were higher with ages (47%, <1 year vs.
75%, >15 years)'®. However, this study did not observe
any differences in the S. aureus colonization rates for
chronic lesions among the different age groups.

S. aureus colonization rates in AD patients can be affected
not only by lesional state and age, but also by disease
severity and duration”. As nasal S. aureus carriage of
caregivers can be a potential source of re-colonization in
children with AD'®, factors such as school status and
family size which can affect the nasal carriage status of S.
aureus should also be considered’”. In our study, as most
of our patients lived in Seoul and suburban areas with
high socioeconomic status, we did not take into account
the various factors that affect 5. aureus colonization except
for lesional state and age.

The observed differences in the colonization rates of S.
aureus among acute and chronic skin lesions in AD and
controls led us to consider the factors affecting the
colonization rates of S. aureus and whether the rates may
represent an infection or simple colonization of 5. aureus
in the human skin. Many factors are related to the skin
barriers, whether innate and adaptive immune defects
have been reported to promote S. aureus colonizations in
AD patients. These contributing factors include defective
lipid layers, exposed extracellular matrix adhesins,
changes in the immune response, bacterial superantigens
and increased specific IgE production’®. Compared with
psoriatic skin lesions and healthy skins, one study found
that the expressions of inducible AMP HBD-2 and LL-37
were significantly decreased in AD skin lesions'®. The
cells of AD patients are unable to efficiently mobilize the
HBD-3 to kill S. aureus’*. Recently, nonlesional skin of
AD patients was shown to have impairments of tight
junction proteins, and this may be partially mediated by
reduction in the claudin-1 gene”°. An IgE reactive protein
to S. aureus and S. aureus fibronectin-binding protein
(FBP) was identified in the sera of AD patients, and more
than one-third of the AD patients showed specific IgE
reactivity to FBP*'. AD patients have been known to
produce lIgE-specific antibodies to staphylococcal enterotoxin A or B; however, it was recently reported that S.
aureus produces extracellular vesicle (EV) like Gramnegative bacteria’. EV isolated from skin lavage fluids of
AD patients contained S. aureus EV-specific proteins, and

 

S. aureus and Atopic Dermatitis

serum S. aureus EV-specific IgE levels were significantly
higher in AD patients than in age-matched controls”.

In this study, we found that the S. aureus colonization rate
was higher in the high serum IgE/eosinophilia group as
compared to those in the normal IgE/normal eosinophil
group in chronic skin lesions but not in acute skin lesions
and control group. These two parameters may work
additively or synergistically on the colonization of S.
aureus, especially in adult patients (Table 4B, Fig. 1B). It
might be possible to use these two parameters as
predictive markers for S$. aureus colonization in chronic
skin lesions of AD, however, this result is against previous
cytokine reports (Th1 in chronic skin and Th2 in acute
skin lesions)**°.

Our data suggests that, in acute lesions of AD patients,
there is a more direct damage to the epidermal skin
barrier, mainly through scratching, and S. aureus can
easily penetrate or invade the skin and feed off skin
exudates. However, in chronic skin lesions of AD, the
defects in tight junctions of the lesional skin and 5. aureus
FBP or S. aureus EV may contribute to the survival of S.
aureus in the lesions.

In conclusion, we found that the S$. aureus colonization
rate was higher in AD patients as compared with non-AD
patients, the colonization rate was even higher in acute
lesions of AD patients than in chronic lesions, and the S.
aureus colonization rate has a tendency to increase with
age regardless of lesional status. As the S. aureus colonization rate was higher in the high serum IgE group/
eosinophilia group in chronic skin lesions but not in acute
skin lesions, we suggest that S. aureus can invade the skin
through barrier defects in acute skin lesions of AD. But,
the S. aureus colonization in chronic skin lesions of AD
patients can be orchestrated through many different
factors including tight junction defects in the skin and S.
aureus FBP or S. aureus EV formation.
