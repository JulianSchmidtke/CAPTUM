aptitude to show an automatic reaction to emotional
warnings by being innate structural. It is proclaimed
that the components of temperament are genetically
independent and show hereditary characteristics by
40% to 60%, and also, it is proclaimed that the genetic effects in character bases are effective by 10%
to 15% and the experienced environmental effects by
30% to 35% [9, 10]. According to Cloninger, personality
is a result of interaction between environmental and
genetic factors [10].

Aim

The aim of this study is to examine the personality and character features of CIU patients and compare
them with healthy controls using the temperament and
character inventory (TCI). Our second goal was to evaluate the correlations between temperament and character
dimensions with clinical factors such as the illness duration and severity of the pruritus and urticaria activity
score (UAS) of CIU patients.

 

 

Material and methods

Seventy patients with CIU and 60 healthy controls,
who were referred to the Akdeniz University Dermatology and Venereology outpatient clinic between June
2013 and September 2013 were included in the study.
Eligible patients were 18 to 70 years of age, diagnosed
with CIU, literate, did not have any systemic or metabolic diseases, and had no dermatological diseases other
han CIU. The exclusion criteria were major depression,
dementia, mental retardation, cognitive impairment, recurrent suicidal thoughts, psychotic illness, psychiatric
drug-use, advanced neurological diseases, and decomensated systemic diseases. Initially, patients with CIU
who presented to our dermatology clinic were informed
about the study and were asked whether they agreed to
articipate. After examination in the dermatology clinic, patients diagnosed with CIU and who chose to paricipate in the study were assessed, and the following
demographics were noted: age, gender, education level,
and duration of urticaria. Seventy patients who comlied with the criteria were included in the study. For
he control group, volunteers who were not diagnosed
with urticaria or any systemic, metabolic or psychiatric
disorder were included. After recording the sociodemographic characteristics of patients and the contro
group, the TCI was applied.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ethical considerations

This study was approved by the ethics committee o
the Antalya Education and Research Hospital and conducted according to the ethical standards of the Helsinki
Declaration of 2000. All subjects signed written informed
consent.

Dermatologic measures

The urticaria activity score (UAS): The UAS was calculated according to the EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF guidelines [3]
and as described by the Maurer group [11]. The UAS was
estimated according to the number of wheals and pruritus intensity, on the day of blood sampling, applying the
following scheme: no wheals = 0, 1-10 wheals = 1, 11-50
wheals = 2, 50 wheals = 3 and pruritus intensity: no = 0,
mild = 1, moderate = 2, severe = 3. UAS scores: daily
(minimum = 0; maximum = 6). The UAS was classified
as follows: 0-2 (mild), 3-4 (moderate) and 5-6 (severe).

Visual analogue scale (VAS): A visual analogue scale
referring to overall urticaria severity during the preceding
2 weeks was completed by the patient at each follow-up
appointment. The scale ranged from 0 to 10, 0 indicating
no disease and 10 indicating very severe urticaria [12].

Psychiatric measures

emperament and Character Inventory (TCI): The TCI
as been used extensively in studies relating psychopathology and personality. The TCI was developed by Cloninger et al. [9] and the Turkish version of the TCI has
een validated by Kose et al. [13]. It has been commonly
used in different areas of psychiatric and psychological
research and practice in the last 10 years. This self-reorted scale consists of 240 items with “true” or “false”
as the response options; it can be applied to individuals
aged 18 years old or older.

The TCI consists of seven main scales formed by
our dimensions of temperament (novelty seeking (NS),
arm-avoidance (HA), reward dependence (RD), and persistence (P)) and 3 dimensions of character ((self-directedness (SD), cooperativeness (C) and self-transcendence
(ST)), along with 24 subscales of these scales: exploratory excitability (NS1), impulsiveness (NS2), extravagance
(NS3), disorderliness (NS4); anticipatory worry (HAI), fear
of uncertainty (HA2), shyness with strangers (HA3), fatigability (HA4); sentimentality (RD1), openness to warmth
(RD2), attachment (RD3); taking responsibility (SD1), intentionality (SD2), resourcefulness (SD3), self-acceptance
(SD4), congruent second nature (SD5); social acceptance
(C1), empathy (C2), helpfulness (C3), compassion (C4),
virtuousness-scrupulousness (C5); self-loss (ST1), people
transpersonal identification (ST2), and spiritual acceptance (ST3).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Statistical analysis

A power analysis demonstrated that 40 patients
would be required in each group to detect significant
differences in TCI scores with a power of 80% and a level
of significance of a = 0.05. Data were computerised using the Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences (SPSS
v.18.00; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Both groups were
compared in terms of TCI main and sub-scale scores. The
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Shapiro-Wilk test were

used to test the normal distribution of the data. As they
were normally distributed, the CIU and control (healthy
normal) groups were compared with Students t -test.
Mann-Whitney U-test was used because the data were
not compatible with normal distribution. As they were
normally distributed, the differences in the TCI scores
between the CIU patients and control groups were analysed using an Pearson’s correlation test and Spearman’s
nonparametric correlation test were obtained between
the UAS, the illness duration and VAS. A p value < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.

 

 

Results
The sociodemographic characteristics of patients
with CIU and the control group are shown in Table 1. In

our study, patients with CIU scored higher on NS (Novelty
seeking), NS3 (Extravagance), NS4 (Disorderliness) and
spiritual acceptance (ST3) scale/subscales of the TCI than
controls (p < 0.05). In addition, the scores in HA2 (Fear of

C2 (Empathy), C3 (Helpfulness), C4 (Compassion), C5 (Viruousness scrupulousness), SD (Self-Directedness), SD1
(Taking responsibility), SD2 (Intentionality), SD5 (Congruent second nature), RD1 (Sentimentality), ST2 (Peole transpersonal identification) scales/subscales were
significantly lower in patients with CIU than in controls
(Tables 2, 3). There were no significant differences beween patients and healthy volunteers with regard to
other scales/subscales of the TCI (p > 0.05). Additionally,
the women with CIU had only a lower score on C2 (Emathy) (1p = 0.007). There were no significant differences
tween men and women with CIU with regard to other
scales/subscales of the TCI (p > 0.05).

For all patients, the mean duration of the illness was
60.64 +97.25 months (6-480 months). Urticaria activity
score ranged between 0 and 6. The mean UAS score was
3.14 +1.60. Visual analogue scale ranged was 0-10. The
mean VAS score was 7.17 +2.95. As shown in Table 4, duration of the illness correlated positively with SD (Self-di

Discussion

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the
patients with CIU had different personality characteristics than healthy individuals. Patients with CIU were
found to score lower on novelty seeking, extravagance
and lower on fear of uncertainty, cooperativeness, social
acceptance, empathy, helpfulness, compassion, virtuousness-scrupulousness, and self-directedness dimensions
of TCI than healthy subjects.

An association between psychological factors and
CIU have been reported [14]. Chronic idiopathic urticaria is often associated with psychiatric symptoms, such
as depression and anxiety, and with stress, which may
lay a role in the genesis of the disease as well as in its
evolution [15]. A high prevalence of mental disorders has
een reported in patients with urticaria [16]. Staubach
et al. [17] have found that 48% of 111 patients with CU
were diagnosed with one or more psychosomatic disorders; most common were anxiety disorders (especially
hobias), followed by depressive and somatoform disorders. A similar prevalence rate (49.4%) was found in
the study by Uguz et al. [8]. In that study [8], the authors
ave observed that 44.9% of the patients with CIU had
at least one personality disorder and the most common
ersonality disorder was found to be obsessive-comulsive personality disorder (30.3%). The patients with
urticaria were found to be less dominant, more intropunitive, more extrapunitive and more neurotic than the
ealthy control group [6]. A few studies in the literature
ave used the NEO-Five Factor Inventory [18] which aims
to measure the “Big Five” personality traits: neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness in patients with CIU. People
with CIU were found to have a significantly higher leve'
of neuroticism [19] and lower level of extraversion [14
than healthy individuals. However, up to now, no studies
ave used TCI to evaluate personality characteristics o
atients with CIU.

The personality and character dimensions of patients
with dermatological disease is of interest. Kim et al. [20
ave shown that the patients with atopic dermatitis were
ound to score higher on harm avoidance and lower on reward dependence, self-directedness and cooperativeness
than the healthy controls. Kili¢ et al. [21] have investigate:
05 patients with psoriasis and found that the patients
ad significantly higher scores of harm avoidance an
ower scores of being self-directedness than the contro

group. Reward dependence, persistence, fear of uncertainty, harm avoidance, self-directedness, cooperativeness and
self-transcendence scores were found to be significantly
higher in hyperhidrosis patients when compared with
healthy controls [22]. In our study, patients with CIU were
found to score higher on novelty seeking and extravagance dimensions of TCI than healthy subjects. Novelty
seeking and extravagance are human personality traits
characterized by impulsive, exploratory, or sensation-seeking behaviour. We also found that CIU patients had lower
scores on fear of uncertainty dimension and fear of uncertainty is the central psychological motivation underlying conservatism. Moreover, patients with CIU had lower
scores on cooperativeness, social acceptance, empathy,
elpfulness, compassion, and virtuousness-scrupulousness dimensions. These findings may reveal that patients
with CIU have a deficit in social interactions.
Personality traits are shown to play a role in the development and progression of medical problems because
hey have been shown to contribute to the development
and progression of health problems [23]. Cloninger’s
model of personality gives the possibility to establish
a connection between functioning of brain systems of inerconnected neurons governing behavioural activation,
behavioural inhibition, and behavioural maintenance
24]. For example, the temperament dimension of harm
avoidance is suggested to indicate central serotonergic
urnover [25]. An inverse relationship was found between
arm avoidance and serotonin and a positive relationship
between self-directedness and serotonin [26]. Moreover,
dopamine was shown to be related with novelty seeking [27]. Some neurotransmitters are speculated to play
an important role in specific types of urticaria [28]. Two
ypes of urticaria are described according to this view:
) Adrenergic urticaria, a rare form of stress-induced
hysical urticaria, caused by various triggers, including
emotional upset, coffee, and chocolate, during which
serum catecholamines and IgE are elevated, whereas
istamine and serotonin levels remain within normal
imits [29], 2) Cholinergic urticaria, which is associated
with nicotine, acetylcholine, or methacholine [30]. In this
respect, neurotransmitter alterations may explain the
relationship between personality dimensions and CIU. In
this study we found that duration of the disease, urticaria, and pruritus severity and frequency of attacks weak
correlated with certain personality traits. Thus our results
may contribute to the literature revealing that psycho
