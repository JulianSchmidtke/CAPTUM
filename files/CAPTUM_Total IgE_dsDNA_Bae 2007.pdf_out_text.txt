Background: Although the mechanism that underlies aspirin
hypersensitivity is not completely understood, an IgE-mediated
response was reported for a patient with aspirin-intolerant
chronic urticaria (AICU).

Objective: We investigated whether genetic polymorphisms
on the a-chain of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRIa)
gene were associated with the AICU phenotype.

Methods: We genotyped 2 promoter polymorphisms (-344C>T
and -95T>C) of FceRIa gene in the Korean population, and
the functional effect of the -344C>T polymorphism was
analyzed by using a luciferase reporter assay and an
electrophoretic mobility shift assay.

Results: The rare allele frequency of the -344C>T
polymorphism was significantly higher in the patients with
AICU compared with the other subjects (P = .008 for AICU
ys aspirin-tolerant chronic urticaria; P = .03 for AICU vs
controls). This polymorphism was also significantly associated
with total serum IgE concentrations and a higher rate of atopy
in the patients with AICU (P = .01 and .05, respectively).

The reporter plasmid that carried the -344T allele exhibited
significantly higher promoter activity in a rat mast cell line
(RBL-2H3) compared with the promoter activity of the -344C
allele (P <.001). We found that transcription factor Mycassociated zinc finger protein preferentially bound the -344C
promoter. Moreover, patients with AICU with the heterozygous
CT genotype of the -344C>T polymorphism exhibited greater
anti-IgE—mediated histamine release compared with those
with the homozygous CC genotype.

Conclusion: These results suggest that the -344C>T
polymorphism of the FceRIa promoter may be associated
with increased expression of FceRIa on mast cells and
enhanced release of histamine.

Clinical implications: The FceRIa —344C>T polymorphism
may contribute to the development of AICU. (J Allergy Clin

Key words: Aspirin hypersensitivity, chronic urticaria, high-affinity
IgE receptor, genetic polymorphism

Sensitivity to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) results in
distinct clinical syndromes including aspirin-intolerant
asthma (AIA), which is a respiratory syndrome, and
aspirin-intolerant chronic urticaria (AICU), which is a
cutaneous syndrome. Although the cellular and biochemical events that occur during adverse reactions to aspirin
are not completely clear, cysteinyl leukotrienes and histamine have been implicated as key mediators of the
pathogenic responses of patients with AIA and AICU,
respectively. Although several molecular genetic studies
of AIA have clarified the pathogenesis of aspirin sensitivity in patients with this syndrome, there has been no
attempt to study the molecular genetics of AICU.

The prevalence of AICU is ~0.2% of the general
population.’ Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs” aggravate 20% to 30% of patients with
chronic urticaria, but the pathogenic mechanism that underlies AICU is unknown. Previously, we compared the
clinical symptoms of patients with AICU with those of patients with aspirin-tolerant chronic urticaria (ATCU).? In
the Korean population, aspirin hypersensitivity confirmed
by an oral provocation test was observed in 35.7% of patients with chronic urticaria who had a high rate of atopy
and high total serum IgE concentrations. Because an
IgE-mediated response was reported for a patient with
AICU,' we speculated that IgE might be involved in the
pathogenesis of AICU. Consequently, in the current study,
we performed a molecular genetic analysis on the a-chain
of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRIa) gene in patients
with AICU.

The high-affinity IgE receptor is expressed on the
surface of effector cells such as mast cells and basophils
and initiates an IgE-mediated allergic response. The classic high-affinity IgE receptor is composed of a tetramer
of a ligand-binding a-chain, a signal-augmenting B-chain,
and a signal-transducing y-chain dimer. Binding of allergens to IgE-occupied high-affinity IgE receptors activates
mast cells and eventually triggers the release of mediators
such as histamine, proinflammatory cytokines (eg, ILs,
TNF-a, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), prostaglandins, and leukotrienes.~° The a-chain of the highaffinity IgE receptor is the primary candidate for initiating
the receptor stabilization that is crucial to the IgE-mediated
allergic response.’

The FceRIa gene is located on chromosome 1q23 in
humans and is composed of 7 exons and 2 promoters, specifically a distal and proximal promoter.* Recently, genetic
association studies demonstrated positive associations
between genetic polymorphisms within the proximal promoter of FceRIa and allergic diseases such as asthma and
atopic dermatitis.”'° However, the possible association
between FceRIa polymorphisms and the pathogenesis of
urticaria has not been addressed. In this study, we investigated whether genetic polymorphisms of FceRIa were
associated with the AICU phenotype by examining the
genotype of FceRIa in patients with AICU, patients with
ATCU, and normal, healthy controls.

METHODS
Subjects and phenotyping

Subjects enrolled from Ajou University Hospital in Suwon,
Korea, were divided into 3 groups (105 patients with AICU, 154
patients with ATCU, and 222 controls). All the subjects participated
in this study were ethnically Korean. Patients with chronic urticaria in
the presence of daily itchy wheals that persisted for more than 6
weeks and no known cause of chronic urticaria such as food allergy,
urticarial vasculitis, physical urticaria, infectious agents, parasites,
or autoimmune disease were classified as either aspirin-tolerant or
aspirin-intolerant on the basis of the result of oral provocation with 500
mg aspirin (Rhonal; KunWha Pharmaceutical Co, Seoul, Korea) as
described previously.'! Patients with both AIA and AICU were excluded
from this study. Normal controls were recruited from the general population. Controls had no personal or family history of allergic diseases, or
aspirin or drug hypersensitivity. All subjects provided informed consent,
and the study protocols were approved by the institutional ethics committee. All subjects fully understood the scope of this study and signed an
informed consent form. Skin prick tests were performed with 12 common
aeroallergens (Bencard Co, West Sussex, United Kingdom). On the basis
of the results of the skin prick tests, atopy was defined as | or more
positive reactions to common inhalant allergens. Total IgE concentrations were measured by using the UniCAP system (Pharmacia
Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Antithyroglobulin and antimicrosomal antibodies in
serum were detected by using anti-Tg radioimmunoassay and antiTPO radioimmunoassay (B-R-A-H-M-S Aktiengesellschaft, Hennigsdorf, Germany), respectively. Serum antinuclear antibody was
detected by using indirect immunofluorescence (Fluoro HEPANA
test, Medical and Biological Laboratories Co, Ltd, Nagoya,
Japan).

Identification and genotyping of single
nucleotide polymorphisms

For single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identification, genomic
DNA donated from 40 healthy Korean volunteers was used. Both
promoter regions of FceRIa were sequenced, including a 1.1-kb
fragment of the distal promoter and a 1.1-kb fragment of the proximal
promoter, to examine SNPs by using the ABI Prism 3100 DNA
analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif). Four sets of
primers designed for the amplification and sequencing analyses
were based on GenBank sequences (reference genome sequence
ABO059239, released on January 26, 2002). The forward and reverse
primer sequences for the distal promoter region were 5'-cattttctgcctagacctgac-3' and 5’-ttcacctgctttctctgagtag-3', respectively, and the
forward and reverse primer sequences for the proximal promoter
region were 5'-actgtccctgtcttcttcagag-3' and 5'-tctacttaccgaagaacagtaagg-3', respectively. Sequence variants were verified using chromatograms. Two SNPs in the proximal promoter were identified at
-344 and -95. No SNPs were detected in the distal promoter.

Single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping was performed by
using the SNP-IT assays of the SNPstream 25K system (Orchid BioSciences, Princeton, NJ). The region of genomic DNA that spanned
the polymorphic site was amplified by using PCR with | phosphothiolated primer and | regular PCR primer. Sequences of amplifying
and extension primers for —344C>T and -95T>C were forward-5'tggcatatgtttggtattcagt-3', reverse-5’-aatctgtcaatctgtgtacaactatttag-3’,
extension-5'-cttagaaaagtggeatgcaagggag-3' (-344C>T), forward-5'agaaagaagcaaaaccaggc-3', reverse-5'-aatataggcttaaaaccaaaaagca-3’,
extension-5’-caaaaagca gxaggaaatgttttctgt-3', (-95T>C). The positions of the aforementioned SNPs are expressed relative to the ATG
translation start site at +1.

Transfection and luciferase reporter assay

RBL-2H3 cells (rat mast cell line #22256; KCLB, Seoul, Korea)
were cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco modified Eagle medium
supplemented with 10% FBS, | mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL
penicillin G, and 100 g/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
Calif) at 37°C in a 5% CO; incubator.

A 673-bp fragment (from —679 to —7) of the proximal promoter
of human FceRIa was prepared by PCR amplification using either
-344C homozygote or —344T homozygote human genomic DNA as a
template. The forward primer sequence was 5'-CAAGGTA
CCAAGAAAAGCGTTGGTAGCTC-3’ (the bold characters represent a Kpnl site). The reverse primer sequence was 5’- CTTCTCC
ATGgACTCCTGGTGC-3’ (the bold characters represent a Ncol
site; g was substituted with T to create the Ncol site). Each of
the PCR products was subcloned separately into the KpnI-—Ncol site
of the pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, Wis).

The mast cell line RBL-2H3 was transfected with the reporter
plasmid (1 2g) and a control plasmid (0.2 pg pRSVBgal) by using
lipofectamine (Invitrogen) as described previously.'* The relative
transcriptional activity of each construct was expressed as the
ratio of luciferase activity to B-galactosidase activity. Each experiment was conducted in triplicate for each sample, and the results are
expressed as the means + SEs for 4 independent experiments (Fig 1).

Nuclear extract preparation and
electrophoretic mobility shift assay

RBL-2H3 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS before being
suspended in ice-cold buffer A (10 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.9; 10
mmol/L KCI; 0.1 mmol/L EDTA; | mmol/L dithiothreitol; 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfony! fluoride; 1 mmol/L NaNO;; 1 mmol/L NaF;
and complete protease inhibitor cocktail; Roche, Basel, Switzerland).
The cells were incubated on ice for 10 minutes and for an additional

15 minutes in the presence of 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma-Aldrich,
St Louis, Mo). After centrifuging at 6000g for 1 minutes, the pellet
was resuspended in extract buffer (20 mmol/L HEPES [Sigma], pH
7.9; 400 mmol/L potassium chloride [Sigma]; 4.5 mmol/L magnesium chloride [Sigma]; 0.2 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
[Sigma]; | mmol/L dithiothreitol [Sigma]; 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfony] fluoride [Sigma]; 1 mmol/L sodium nitrate [Sigma]; 1 mmol/L
sodium fluoride [Sigma]; and complete protease inhibitor cocktail;
Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, Ind) and were incubated on
ice for | hour. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 minutes.
After the addition of 15% glycerol, the supernatant was stored at
—80°C until use.

The following double-stranded oligonucleotides were used as
probes for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA): 5'gttttattctgeccteccttgcat-3’ and 5’-atgcaagggagggcagaataaaac-3’ corresponded to —354/-334 for -344C; 5’-gttttattctgctcteccttgcat-3' and
5'-atgcaagggagagcagaataaaac-3'’ corresponded to —354/-334 for
-344T; and 5'-cgcttgatgactcagecggaa-3’ and 5'-ttecggctgagtcatcaagcg-3' (API), 5’-ctegegecctececcge-3' and 5'-gcggeggaggecgcgag-3'
(Myc-associated zinc finger protein [MAZ]!*), and 5’-attcgatcgegecggeecgagc-3' and 5’-cgagcggegcegegctagctta-3' (SP1)
were competitors. The double-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed by incubation at 95°C for 5 minutes and successive gradual
cooling to 37°C. The double-stranded DNA probes were radiolabeled
at their 5’ ends with DNA polymerase I (Klenow; Promega) and
[a-*?P]2’-deoxycytidine 5’ triphosphate (Amersham Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). Reaction mixtures (15 «L) that contained 5 pg
nuclear extract, 10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 400 ng poly(dIdC),
1 mmol/L MgCh, 30 mmol/L KCl, 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol,
1 mmol/L NaNO;, | mmol/L NaF, and 5% glycerol were preincubated at room temperature in the absence of the probe for 20 minutes
before being incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature in the
presence of 0.2 pmol radiolabeled probe. The reaction mixtures
were then subjected to electrophoresis on a native 6% polyacrylamide
gel. For competition experiments, unlabeled blunt-ended competitor
oligonucleotides were added to the binding reaction mixtures before
adding the radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes. The labeled probe
was then added to the reaction mixture, which was then incubated
for an additional 20 minutes before being electrophoresed on a native
6% polyacrylamide gel. Competitive binding assay was performed to
identify the transcription factor bound to —344 probe with incubation
of 100-fold excess amounts of the unlabeled MAZ, SP1, or API
probe. Supershift assay is described in detail in the Methods section
in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org.

All gels were dried and radioactivity was detected using a
FLA3000 scanner (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). Modifications
to the aforementioned procedures are described in the figure legends.

Histamine release from basophils

Preparation of peripheral blood leukocytes for fluorometric measurement of histamine release was performed in 15 volunteers with
AICU with complaints of daily urticaria according to methods
described previously.'*"'° Briefly, 20 mL blood was mixed with
2.5 mL of 6% dextran (in 3% dextrose) and 1 mL EDTA. Samples
were allowed to sediment at room temperature for 2 hours. The plasma
fraction that contained the leukocytes was isolated by centrifugation
at 250g for 8 minutes. The leukocyte pellet was washed twice with
PIPES solution A (25 mmol/L piperazine-N-N-bis-2 ethane sulfonic
acid, 110 mmol/L sodium chloride, 5 mmol/L potassium chloride,
40 mmol/L sodium hydroxide, and 0.03% human serum albumin;
PH adjusted to 7.4) before being resuspended in PIPES solution B
(91 mmol/L calcium chloride, 0.5 mmol/L magnesium chloride, and
0.1% dextrose in PIPES) to a final concentration of ~5 X 10° cells/
mL. For the histamine release assay, 100 jxL calcium ionophore,

antibodies (1:10, 1:100, 1:1,000 vol/vol; KPL, Gaithersburg, Md)
were added to 200 wL leukocyte suspension, which was then
incubated for 15 minutes at 37°C. In parallel, leukocyte suspensions
were incubated with PIPES solution B alone to assay spontaneous
histamine release. The total cellular histamine concentration was
measured by adding 0.1 mL 55% trichloroacetic acid to the leukocyte
suspension. The suspensions were centrifuged at 250g for 15 minutes
at 4°C, and the supernatants were then collected and stored at -20°C
until assayed for histamine. All of the aforementioned experiments
were performed in duplicate. The histamine concentration was
measured by using an automated fluorometric analyzer (Astoria
analyzer 300; Astoria-Pacific, Clackamas, Ore). Histamine release
was expressed as a percentage of the total cellular histamine concentration by using the following formula: percent histamine release =
100 X ({stimulated histamine release — spontaneous histamine
release]/[total cellular histamine release — spontaneous histamine
release]). The histamine releasability from each patient by
stimulation with antihuman goat IgE antibodies was presented as
the maximum value of histamine release in response to 3 different
concentrations of antihuman goat IgE antibodies (1:10, 1:100, and
1:1000 vol/vol).

Statistical analysis

The genotype frequency at each SNP was examined for significant
departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium by using a y° test.
Differences in genotype frequency between patients and controls
were analyzed by using a x? test and by calculating the odds ratio
with a 95% CI. Three logistic regression models (codominant, dominant, and recessive) were used to analyze SNPs after controlling for
age and sex as covariates. Linkage disequilibrium between loci was

measured by using the absolute value of Lewontin |D'| and r?.'7

RESULTS
Clinical characteristics of the study subjects

The clinical characteristics of the subjects are summarized in Table I. The patients with AICU were significantly
younger (P = .003) than the patients with ATCU, whereas
the rate of atopy and total serum IgE concentrations were
significantly higher in the patients with AICU compared
with the patients with ATCU (P < .001 and P = .009,
respectively). The prevalence of serum autoantibodies
including antithyroglobulin antibody, antimicrosomal
antibody, and antinuclear antibody was not different between the patients with AICU and ATCU.

Frequencies of FceRla SNPs in patients
with chronic urticaria

The allele and genotype frequencies of 2 FceRla
polymorphisms are presented in Table II. The genotype
distributions of both polymorphisms did not depart significantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P > .05). The

frequency of the genotype and allele that contained the
-344T allele was significantly higher in the patients with
AICU compared with the patients with ATCU (AICU vs
ATCU, P = .007 for the codominant model, P = .039
for the dominant model, P = .028 for the recessive model,
and P = .008 for the allele frequency; AICU vs controls,
P = .028 for the codominant model and P = .030 for the
allele frequency). The genotype and allele frequencies of
the -95T>C polymorphism were also significantly higher
in the patients with AICU compared with the patients with
ATCU (P = .014 for the codominant and recessive model
and P = .16 for the allele frequency). There were no significant differences in allele and genotype frequencies
between the patients with AICU and the controls. The
homozygous CC genotype of the —95C polymorphism
was not detected in any of the subjects. Two promoter polymorphisms in the FeeRIa gene were not in linkage disequilibrium (ID'| = 0.74 and r=0.01).

Associations between chronic urticaria
phenotype and SNPs

We determined whether there were any associations
between the 2 polymorphisms and clinical parameters
such as atopy; elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate;
and concentrations of total serum IgE, antithyroglobulin
antibodies, antimicrosomal antibodies, and antinuclear
antibodies (Table III). Patients with AICU who carried the
-344T allele had higher total serum IgE concentrations

than patients with AICU who had the homozygous CC
genotype (P = .01). The atopy rate was higher in patients
with AICU who carried the —344T allele compared with
patients with AICU who had the homozygous CC genotype, although this difference barely reached statistical
significance (P = .05). There were no significant associations among the various clinical parameters and the
~95T>C polymorphism in the patients with AICU.

Effects of the -344C>T polymorphism on
transcriptional activity

To examine whether the -344C>T polymorphism was
associated with altered promoter activity, we used a
luciferase reporter assay to compare the reporter activity
of plasmids that contained either —344T or —344C in the
FceRIa promoter (Fig 1). Constructs that contained —344T
exhibited significantly greater luciferase activity compared with the constructs that contained —344C (P < .001).

To investigate whether the genetic polymorphism created a transcription factor binding site, we performed an
EMSA with nuclear extracts from RBL-2H3 cells using
double-stranded oligonucleotide probes that corresponded
to—344C/T (-334/-354; Fig 2, A). A specific band was observed with the —344C probe but not with the —344T probe
(Fig 2, B). The shifted band produced by the —-344C probe
was not visible in the presence of the nonlabeled —-344C
probe but remained visible in the presence of the nonlabeled —344T probe (Fig 2, C). A survey of a database
of transcription factors suggested that the —344C>T polymorphism generated a potential MAZ-binding motif,
namely CCCACCC. To clarify the involvement of
MAZ, we performed a competition assay by using MAZ
and SP1 probe, and found that the shifted band corresponding to the -344C probe was completely competed by unlabeled MAZ probe, but not by unlabeled SP1 and AP1
probes (Fig 2, D).

 

Effects of the -344C>T polymorphism on IgEinduced histamine release from basophils

Because IgE binds FceRIa to induce the release of
histamine from mast cells, we evaluated the effects of the
polymorphism at —344C>T on histamine release from
peripheral blood basophils in patients with AICU by using

serial additions of the calcium ionophore, A23187, and
anti-IgE antibodies. IgE-mediated histamine release in
patients who carried the heterozygous CT genotype was
significantly higher compared with patients with the
homozygous CC genotype (P = .045; Fig 3, B). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the amount of
histamine released by A23187 between these 2 genotypes
(Fig 3, A).

DISCUSSION

This is the first study to demonstrate a significant
association between genetic polymorphisms of FceRIa
and the AICU phenotype. Our results suggest that the
human FceRIa gene may play an important role in the
development of chronic urticaria associated with aspirin
sensitivity.

Shikanai et al? were the first to describe 3 promoter polymorphisms in FceRla, namely -770A>C, -664G>A,
and —335C>T (—344C>T in the current study), in white
subjects and African American subjects with asthma.
The polymorphism —95T>C has been reported to exist
in Japanese patients with atopic dermatitis,'° but the authors of the aforementioned study did not detect other
SNPs because the region within which screening was performed (—338 to + 178) was too short. In the current study,
we identified 2 SNPs at -344C>T and -95T>C in the
1.3-kb proximal promoter region of FceRIa in a Korean
population, which suggests that there may be ethnic differences in the distribution of FceRIa genotypes.

Our study revealed a significant association between
the -344C>T polymorphism and the AICU phenotype.
Specifically, patients with AICU had a significantly higher
frequency of the minor allele of the -344C>T polymorphism compared with the control subjects. Moreover, the
—344C>T polymorphism was associated with a higher rate
of atopy and total serum IgE concentrations in the patients
with AICU. These findings are consistent with previous
reports that severe reactions to aspirin occur more often in
atopic than in nonatopic subjects.*'* Several reports have
suggested that circulating IgE may be related to the regulation of high-affinity IgE receptor expression in mast cell

and basophils, which might promote cell survival
and increase histamine release.”* In addition, the accumulation of basophils at sites of inflammation also may be
induced by IgE and stimulation of FceRI via cross-linking
of these molecules.”> In this study, we found that the
-344C>T polymorphism was significantly associated
with higher total serum IgE concentrations in patients
with AICU. This suggests that prolonged exposure to

IgE may increase the surface expression of high-affinity
IgE receptors and might induce the accumulation of basophils at sites of inflammation in patients with AICU,
particularly in patients who carry the —344T allele; presumably, this would lead ultimately to chronic inflammation. Therefore, atopy mediated by IgE may be a risk factor
for aspirin sensitivity in patients with AICU. The genotype distribution of the —95T>C polymorphism was
J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL
VOLUME 119, NUMBER 2

significantly different between patients with AICU and
ATCU but not between patients with AICU and the controls. Therefore, we focused on the functional effects of
the -344C>T polymorphism.

To investigate the effects of the -344C>T polymorphism on FceRIa expression, we used a functional assay
of promoter activity in reporter constructs that contained
wild-type or polymorphic promoters in the RBL-2H3 line
of mast cells. Constructs that contained the —344T allele
had significantly more promoter activity compared with
those that contained the —344C allele. This effect was
specific to basophils because it could not be replicated in
other types of cell line that do not contain FceRIa, such as
a human bronchial epithelial cell line (A549) and a human.
monocyte cell line (U937). In addition, this polymorphism
affected a transcription factor binding in the promoter
region of FceRIa because a shifted band was found in the
presence of the —344C probe in the EMSA finding. The
transcription factor bound to the —344C probe was identified as MAZ through a competition assay, because MAZ
was bound to the —344C allele promoter with a higher
affinity compared with that of the —344T allele promoter.
For further identification of recognition sequence of MAZ,
mutational assays were performed using 100-fold excess
amounts of unlabeled mutant probe. CCCACCC (-345/
—339) was found to serve as a core sequence for binding of
the nuclear protein (see this article’s Fig El in the Online
Repository at www.jacionline.org). We also performed
supershift assays using 2 kinds of commercially available
anti-MAZ antibodies (MAZ L-20 for recognizing an internal epitope and MAZ A-17 for recognizing C-terminal
epitope; Santa Cruz, Calif) and found that these 2 antiMAZ antibodies could not affect DNA-protein complex
formation in the —-344C probe (see this article’s Fig E2 in
the Online Repository at www.jacionline.org), possibly
because these 2 anti-MAZ antibodies were affinitypurified goat polyclonal antibodies raised against human
MAZ and they may fail to recognize rat MAZ. MAZ is a
multifunctional transcription factor that is involved in
both positive?®?” and negative regulation?®”° of gene
expression. In the transcription regulation of FceRIa gene,
MAZ may act as a negative regulator because the —-344C
allele-contained reporter construct showed lower promoter activity compared with the —344T allele—contained
reporter construct.

FceRIa is required for mast cells to initiate an IgEmediated allergic reaction because FceRIa-deficient mice
fail to exhibit allergic reactions even in the presence of
antigens and antigen-specific IgE.°*° After being activated via FceRI, mast cells release histamine, leukotrienes, and other vasoactive substances. To examine
whether genetic variants of FeeRIa might contribute to
the aforementioned process, we assayed histamine release
from human peripheral blood basophils harvested from
patients with AICU. We found a significant correlation
between the -344C>T polymorphism and greater
amounts of histamine release. Patients with AICU who
carried the heterozygous CT genotype of the —344C>T
polymorphism exhibited a greater amount of histamine

Bae et al 455

release compared with those with the homozygous CC
genotype. These findings supported our hypothesis that
genetic variants of the FceRIa gene may create a transcription factor-binding site that leads ultimately to an increase in the expression of FceRIa. During prolonged
exposure to IgE, this would lead to an increase in histamine release.

This study has the following limitations. First, we did
not evaluate the functional effects of the -9ST>C polymorphism in RBL-2H3 cells. Therefore, we cannot
exclude the possibility that the 2 polymorphisms might
interact. Second, the functional effects of the -344C>T
polymorphism in the human basophil cell line, KU-812,
could not be determined because of a low transfection
efficiency. Further studies will address the functional
effects of the -344C>T polymorphism in other inflammatory cells.

In conclusion, the results of the current study suggest
that the -344C>T polymorphism in the promoter of the
FceRIa gene is associated with AICU. Specifically, the
—344T allele may increase the expression of high-affinity
IgE receptors on mast cells to enhance histamine release,
which likely contributes to the development of AICU.
