ment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). In the literature, there are vary studies about
effect of OMA treatment in CSU such as different response rates to treatment, different
dose / time regime and different relapse rates after treatment. To investigate the evaluate
the effect of at least 1 year continuous OMA treatment on relapse in CSU patients. Fifty
patients were included in this study. There was a significant decreased between UAS7
score before and after OMA treatment. There was no significant difference between the
sixth and 12th month after OMA for UAS 7 scores. At the end of 12 month,84% of
patients had complete or good response to OMA treatment. Twenty-three of 34 patients
(67.6%) who discontinued treatment had relapse and 11 patients had no relapse. Duration
of disease was significantly higher in patients who had relapse. Based on our study result
we suggest that long disease duration may increase the risk of relapse. Although it is not
statistically significant, without interruption OMA treatment for more than 1 year may
decrease relapse risk in patients who respond well to the therapy.

1 | INTRODUCTION

therapy." OMA is a humanized anti-lgE monoclonal antibody. Its

mechanism of action in CSU has not yet been completely elucidated.

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is defined as recurrent wheals
and/or angioedema for a period of 6 weeks or longer in the absence
of a triggering factor.? The physiopathology of CSU has not yet been
fully understood. Yet, some systems such as autoimmunity, coagulation, and autoallergy are thought to play a role in the course of the
disease.” The disease negatively affects the quality of life; therefore,
treatment is of great importance. Treatment response and disease
course vary in each patient. Multiple factors may be involved in the
clinical and prognostic polymorphism of CSU.*> The guidelines for
the treatment of CSU recommend the use of second-generation nonsedating H1-antihistamines for initial therapy and suggest up-dosing
of these antihistamines up to 4-fold in patients with CSU who are
unresponsive to standard doses. When they fail to achieve success,

the guidelines recommend the use of omalizumab (OMA) as third-line

It binds to circulating free IgE and indirectly downregulates the
expression of FceRI receptor on mast cells and basophils. In the literature, there are studies conducted in different countries showing the
efficacy and safety of OMA in CSU. But, there is uncertainty as to
how long the treatment will continue or when it will be terminated.>”
In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of at least 1-year

continuous use of OMA treatment on relapse in CSU patients.

2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS

In total, we analyzed 152 patients diagnosed with CSU and used
OMA in our specialized urticaria outpatient clinic between 2016 and
2019. The study included only 50 of these patients since the

remaining did not meet the eligibility criteria for the study. The inclusion criteria were determined as follows: patients aged 18 years or
older, being resistant to up to 4-fold dosed second-generation antihistaminic treatment before OMA treatment according to the urticaria
guidelines, receiving at least 12 doses of OMA without interruption
(300 mg every 4 weeks). The licensed dosage of OMA is 300 mg
every 4 weeks for 6 months in Turkey. After the 6 months the treatment can be prescribed for 6 months intervals. The weekly urticaria
activity score (UAS7) was used to monitor disease severity. UAS7 was
calculated before and after OMA treatment at 6 and 12 months. Disease severity was classified based on UAS7 as follows: severe CSU
(UAS7: 28-42), moderate CSU (UAS7: 16-27), mild CSU (UAS7: 7-15),
and well-controlled CSU (UAS7: 1-6).° The response to treatment was
recorded as follows: complete response (CR) (UAS7 < 2), wellactivity (WCA) (2<UAS7< 6), partial response
(PR) (UAS7 > 6, but 210 points of decrease from baseline), or no

response (NR) (no change or increase in UAS7).”*° Age, gender, dis

(total IgE), presence of positivity for antinuclear antibody (ANA) and
thyroid autoantibodies, personal history of autoimmune disease, and
UAS7 were retrospectively collected from the records. Patients with

missing or incomplete records were excluded from the study.

3 | STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

The analysis of the data was performed using statistical software programme (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The chi-square test was used, as
appropriate, to analyze differences between groups in categorical variables. The Shapiro Wilk test was used to evaluate the normality of distribution of continuous variables. According to results of normality
test, the Student's t test or the Mann-Whitney U test was used to
analyze differences in continuous variables. A two-tailed P-value of

0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

4 | RESULTS

Fifty patients who were regularly followed up for CSU and received
monthly 300 mg OMA treatment for at least 1 year between 2016
and 2019 were enrolled in the study. This study included patients, of
which 36 (72%) were female and 14 (28%) were male. The mean age
of the patients was 44.3 + 11.4 years and the mean disease duration
was 5.6 + 3.8 years (range, 2-20 years). The severity of the disease
was evaluated using the Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7). According to
UAS, 3 patients (6%) had mild, 7 patients (14%) had moderate and
40 patients (80%) had severe form of the disease before the treatment. The mean UAS7 value for the 50 patients was 31 + 8.1 before
OMA treatment. The mean post-treatment UAS7 value at 6 months
was 3.9 + 8.3 and was 2.8 + 7.6 at 12 months. There was a significant

decrease in the UAS7 before and after 6 and 12 months of OMA
treatment. (P = .000, P = .000) There was no significant difference
between the 6- and 12-month UAS7 values.(P = .169) The mean number of OMA doses was 26.4 + 10.8. Nine patients (18%) were positive
for ANA. Positivity for anti-thyroglobulin or anti-TPO autoantibodies
was observed in 13 (26%) patients. Seventeen (34%) patients had evidence of autoimmunity. Sixteen patients (32%) had angioedema. The
mean level of total IgE was 174.7 kU/L (range, 21-1243 kU/L) and
11(22%) of the patients had elevated levels of IgE. None of the
patients developed any side effects with OMA treatment.

The evaluation of concomitant standard-dose antihistamine use
with OMA revealed that of the 50 patients, 23 (46%) regularly used
antihistaminic drugs with OMA during the follow-up, 22 (44%) used
these drugs irregularly for a short period of time, and only 5 (10%) did
not use any antihistamines at any time. None of the patients required
an increase in the antihistaminic dose.

When the patients' response to treatment was evaluated at
12 months, it was found that only 2 patients (4%) did not respond to
treatment. Of the 50 patients, 39 (78%) had a complete response,
3 (6%) had a well-controlled disease, and 6 (12%) had a partial
response. In the follow-up, 36 (72%) of the 50 patients discontinued
the treatment. Fourteen (28%) patients never discontinued the treatment and regularly used antihistaminic drugs. The reasons for the discontinuation of the treatment were unresponsiveness (2 patients),
remission, and patient's request (34 patients). Twenty-three of the
34 patients (67.6%) who discontinued the treatment relapsed (8 males,
15 females). Eleven patients had no relapse (Table 1). Twenty-one
patients were re-initiated on OMA. The disease duration was significantly higher in the patients who relapsed (P = .042). When relapsed
and nonrelapsed patients were compared, we found that the presence
of autoimmunity was more common in nonrelapsed patients than in
relapsed patients. There was no statistically significant difference
between gender, UAS7, IgE level, presence of angioedema, and
relapse.(Table 2).

The mean remission time was 4.52 +4.14 months (range,
2-16 months) in the patients who were treated with OMA after
relapse. In the patients who were followed up without relapse and
treatment, the mean remission time was 15.36 + 7.19 months (range,
4-25 months). The mean number of OMA dose was 27.83 + 7.91 in
the patients who relapsed. In the patients who did not relapse, the
mean number of OMA dose was 17.0 + 7.86 (P = .001) (Table 2).

5 | DISCUSSION

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) affects 0.5%-1% of the population. Due to the chronic course and high relapse rates of the disease, it negatively affects the quality of life of patients. Therefore,
the goal of chronic urticaria therapy is to control symptoms and
improve the patient's quality of life. Early predictions may help
evaluate the course of the disease and risk for relapse, as well as
may be useful in selecting appropriate treatment and follow-up

plans for patients.

OMA is known to be effective in the treatment, but its mechanism of action is not exactly known. Studies have found different
response rates to treatment, mean OMA dose, and different posttreatment relapse rates. However, there are some questions that have
not yet been clarified as to when and which patients can discontinue
the treatment; therefore, there is no clear consensus on management
of OMA treatment in CSU patients. Some studies have shown that
OMA updosing such as 450 mg or 600 mg /4 week or decreasing
dose interval can be effective in partial responder or nonresponder
patients. In our clinic, we suggest shortening interval or updosing
OMA for partial or nonresponders patients. But, we did not include
these patients group in this study because we evaluated only standart
OMA regime.45:1412

In line with the literature, this study found that the prevalence of
CSU was higher in females. When males and females were compared
in our study, the risk of relapse was not higher in female patients, as
in the study by Marzano et al.1?4

In our study, 78% of the patients (39 patients) had complete
remission at the end of 12 months. However, at the end of the final
analysis, 67.6% of the patients relapsed after approximately
4.5 months. No relapse was observed in 32% of the patients.
Labrador-Horillo et al reported that the relapse rate of 110 patients
was 47.5% after 11.4 months.*° Ghazanfar et al found a relapse rate
of 58% after 12 months.*© Marzano et al found a relapse rate of
66.3%.14 Maruer et al showed that up to 61% of patients would experience clinical worsening after the discontinuation of OMA, even if
the treatment was maintained for 1 year.*” Larenas-Linnemann et al
reported that about 20% of patients showed long-term remission
without relapse.? Our study demonstrated that relapse could often
occur within the first 6 months after the discontinuation of the treatment. The duration of remission increases as the rate of relapse
decreases.

In line with the literature, our study shows that OMA is an effective and safe option in the treatment of chronic urticaria.‘ We found

a significant improvement in UAS7 values between the baseline and
6-month follow-up. The good response of our patients at 6 months
was continued at 12 months.

At this point, the question of which patients should discontinue
the treatment at 6 months and which patients should continue the
treatment raises.

In the literature, there are studies investigating the clinical and
laboratory parameters that affect the response to treatment and the
tendency to develop relapse.°?214182° Our results suggested that
the longer duration of disease was associated with the risk of relapse,
as suggested by Marzano et al. Accordingly, in terms of UAS7, we
found no significant correlation between the baseline UAS7 and the
risk of relapse. Marzano et al and Ferrer et al reported that high values
of baseline UAS7 might be the markers for the risk of relapse after
the discontinuation of OMA. Marzano et al found that IgE was associated with clinical response to OMA, as in other studies in the literature; however, it was not associated with relapse. In our study, we
found no correlation between IgE and relapse, as in the study by
Marzano et al.111420

Studies have shown that circulating IgG antibodies against IgE
and the high-affinity IgE receptor are likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of CSU. In addition, some autoimmune diseases have been
associated with chronic urticaria. Many studies have suggested that
CSU may be an autoimmune condition. Approximately 40% of cases
of CSU are thought to be autoimmune in terms of etiology. Autoimmunity may be involved in CSU with higher activity and longer duration. In a prospective study of 139 patients followed up over 5 years,
the duration of urticaria was correlated with the presence of antithyroid antibodies and positive autoimmune markers (positive autologous serum skin test [ASST] and antithyroid antibodies).>1724?2 In
our study, we evaluated the correlation between autoimmunity and
the presence of relapse. When relapsed and nonrelapsed patients
were compared, we found that the presence of autoimmunity was
more common in nonrelapsed patients than in relapsed patients. In
particular, these patients had thyroid disease. Marzano et al evaluated
470 patients but found no correlation between relapse and autoimmunity.* In the literature, Kirkpatrick et al and Rumbyrt et al reported
that the treatment of concomitant thyroid disease might induce
remission of CSU and angioedema. However, there are conflicting
results in the literature in this respect.>?°"2> Our nonrelapsed patients
were followed up and treated by an endocrinologist. This may have
contributed to this surprising result in our study.

We found the mean OMA dose for relapsed and nonrelapsed
patients as 27.8 and 17.0, respectively. This difference was statistically significant. Actually, this difference was an expected result since
the patients with relapse had to be treated longer. However, what
was notable was that the patients without relapse received treatment
for more than 1 year. Our patients were able to achieve complete
remission at 6 and 12 months, but the patients without relapse
received longer treatment for more than 1 year. But we did not find
any statistically significant correlation between relapse and duration
of treatment. However, this result was probably due to the small num
ber of patients enrolled in the study.

In the final analysis, 35 patients were still receiving OMA treatment.
In a study of 298 patients in the US, more than 70% of patients
remained on OMA treatment for at least 1 year. A Danish study reported
that 56% of CSU patients were on treatment after 1 year.2° These
results are similar to our results. We could not discontinue the treatment
in 14 patients. These patients achieved a complete or partial remission
with concomitant OMA treatment and with a regular standard-dose antihistaminic drug. The remaining 21 patients were those who were initiated on OMA after relapse. We found no correlation between
autoimmunity and patients who cannot discontinuation of the treatment.
This suggests that multifactorial factors play a role in the pathogenesis of
the disease and response to treatment, which makes it difficult for us to
predict the course of the disease, as well as response to treatment.

Our results showed that 84% of the patients had a complete or
good response to OMA treatment. At the same time, 90% of the patients
receiving OMA treatment had to continue with standard-dose antihistaminic therapy continuously or intermittently. Good responses to OMA
treatment were achieved within the first 6 months. The response continued at the same rate throughout the first year. Up to half of the patients
who discontinued OMA treatment relapsed within the first 6 months.
Therefore, the first 6 months are important both in the evaluation of the
treatment response after the initiation of treatment and in the evaluation
of relapse after the discontinuation of treatment.

The limitations of our study are the small sample size, retrospective design, and not carrying out the ASST test in the patients.

In conclusion, OMA is an effective and safe treatment. However, it is uncertain as to how long the treatment will continue and
based on which parameters it will be discontinued or not. Whether
urticaria has a tendency to spontaneous remission or how long it
shows this tendency varies in each patient. Therefore, it is difficult
to yield precise results. Based on our study results, we suggest that
long disease duration may increase the risk of relapse. Although it is
not statistically significant, maintaining OMA treatment for more
than 1 year may decrease the risk of relapse in patients who respond

well to the treatment.
