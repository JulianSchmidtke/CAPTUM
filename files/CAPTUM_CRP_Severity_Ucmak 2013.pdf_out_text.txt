Introduction: C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is one of its most important simulators, were
determined in great amounts in the sera of patients with chronic urticaria (CU).
Aim: To determine the levels of IL-6 in patients with urticaria, and evaluate its relationship with urticaria activity

scores and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI).

Material and methods: Fifty-three patients with CU were included in the study successively by determining their urticaria

activity scores (0-3) and DLQI (0-5).
subjects were included as a control group.

he CRP and IL-6 were measured by immune assay methods. Thirty-two healthy

Results: Serum levels of IL-6 and CRP were significantly higher in patients with CU compared to healthy controls
(p < 0.001, p = 0.026 respectively). There was a statistically significant correlation among urticaria activity scores
and IL-6 and CRP concentration (p = 0.004, p = 0.042). This correlation was more significant in patients who had
moderate and severe disease activity scores than in those who had mild disease activity score (p < 0.001, p < 0.001,
respectively). There was a statistically significant association between DLQI and IL-6 (p = 0.025). This correlation was
very significant in patients who had severe and very severe disease activity scores (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively).
DLQI scores and serum levels of IL-6 were significantly different in the very severe group compared to healthy con
trols (p = 0.024).
Conclusions: The levels of CRP and

 

L-6 are increased in patients with CU. A relationship of DLQI and urticaria activ
ity scores with CRP and IL-6 was found. These findings support the relationship between the inflammatory process

in CU and the clinical findings.

Key words: chronic urticaria, Dermatology Life Quality Index, interleukin-6.

Introduction

The major pathophysiological phenomena secondary
to tissue damage and inflammation results in an increase
in the concentrations of acute phase reactants (APR) [1, 2].
Although the name APR contains the term acute, it presents with both acute and chronic inflammatory conditions
[3]. Differences in grades of APR largely stem from the
effects of inflammatory molecules, called cytokines. Some
of the major cytokines relevant to the APR are interleukin-6
and Jf (IL-6, IL-1B), tumor necrosis factor-o (TNF-o), and
interferon-y (IFN-y). These proteins influence APR production
in hepatocytes, with IL-6 being the great inducer of most

APR [4, 5]. Although local CRP synthesis and secretion are
present in other regions, plasma CRP production is only performed by hepatocytes and this largely occurs under the
transcriptional control of IL-6 [3]. In a study of KasperskaZajac et al., it was found that IL-6 and CRP levels were highly correlated with urticarial activity among urticaria
patients and in the remission periods the level of this
cytokine was low [6]. This result made us think that an
increase in CRP and IL-6 must be considered as a marker
of urticarial activity. It appears that dysfunction of the neuro-endocrine-immune system resulting from stress and other factors seems to be an interesting theory underlying the
pathogenesis of urticaria [7]. Mast cells may be speculated

to be the main source of IL-6 during chronic urticaria (CU)
exacerbation associated with stress [8]. Despite an abundance of studies on pharmacology and treatment of
chronic urticaria, there are only a restricted number of studies covering the quality of life of patients with CU [9, 10].
In this study we aimed to show the relationship of plasma IL-6 and serum CRP levels with disease activity and to
evaluate the relationship of Dermatology Life Quality Index
(DLO) scores with these parameters and disease severity.

Material and methods

Patients

Fifty CU patients (19 males and 31 females; median age
35 years, range 18-55) were included in the study. The control group consisted of 33 healthy subjects, median age is
36 years ranging from 20 to 60. Patients with CU were divided into two subgroups according to the results of the autologous skin serum test (ASST). This test was performed in
accordance with the method by Sabroe et al. [11].

Negative ASST was found in 38 patients and 12 patients had a positive reaction. All the controls responded
negatively to ASST. Thirty-eight patients had no history of
angioedema; however, 12 had a history of angioedema. In
all cases, any known causes of CU were ruled out by appropriate investigations. When blood samples were collected, no patients had any medical history of past or active
infectious disease. Those with physical urticaria were excluded from the study. The administration of anti-histaminic
drugs was interrupted about 1 week before the study. None
of the patients included in the study had a drug administration history until 6 weeks to the study. The study was
approved by the university’s ethical committee. Written
informed consent was obtained from all participants.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Evaluation of urticaria activity scores

All patients had active disease at the time of evaluation and were divided into subgroups according to their
urticarial activity. Urticaria activity score (UAS) was calculated according to EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF guidelines [12] and
as described by Maurer group [13]. The UAS was estimated
according to the number of wheals and pruritus intensity, on the day of blood sampling, applying the following

s
d

 

 

scheme: no wheals = 0, 1-10 wheals = 1, 11-50 whea
= 2, 50 wheals = 3 and pruritus intensity: no = 0, mi
= 1, moderate = 2, severe = 3. UAS scores: daily (minimum
= 0; maximum = 6). The UAS was classified as follows:
0-2 (mild), 3-4 (moderate) and 5-6 (severe). In our study,
13 patients had mild, 19 patients — moderate, and 18
patients — severe chronic urticaria symptoms.

 

Blood sampling and interleukin-6 and C-reactive
protein assay

Between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m. the blood of all patients
was taken and stored at —-80°C until they were studied.

Serum samples were gradually brought to room temperature. Plasma IL-6 concentration was determined by
ELISA using (DYNEX Technologies, USA) a commercial ki
(Invitrogen Corporation, 542 Flynn Road, Camarillo).
Serum concentration of CRP was evaluated using the high
sensitive immunochemistry system, nephelometric method
(image 800, Beckman Coulter, USA).

Assay of Dermatology Life Quality Index

All patients with CU were asked to complete the DLQ
at the first interview. There are 10 items in the DLQI in six
subsections: Symptoms and Feelings (items 1 and 2), Daily Activities (items 3 and 4), Leisure (items 5 and 6), Work
and School (item 7), Personal Relationships (items 8 and
9) and Treatment (item 10). The questions in the form were
replied as “not at all”, “a little”, “a lot” and “very much”,
with scores of 0, 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Depending on the
patients’ responses, the total score varied between a minimum and maximum of 0 to 30. Those with a quality of life
being unaffected according to the DLQI score were
grouped as (0-1), mild impairment (2-5), moderate impairment (6-10), severe impairment (11-20) and very severe
impairment (21-30). The highest score showed the highest impact on the quality of life [14]. We used the official
Turkish version downloaded from www.dermatology.org.uk.
Our study comprised 0 patients with no impairment, 5 patients with mild impairment, 10 patients with moderate
impairment, 26 patients with severe impairment, and 9 patients with very severe impairment.

 

 

 

 

 

Statistical analysis

Data were delivered as medians and ranges, and comparisons between groups were performed by MannWhitney U test. The Kruskal-Wallis variance analysis was
used for screening differences between the groups. The correlation was analysed by the Spearman test. Values of
p below 0.05 were considered significant.

Results

n comparison with the healthy controls in our trial, the
median plasma IL-6 concentration was notably higher in CU
patients (46.57 pg/ml vs. 20.34 pg/ml; p < 0.001) (Figure 1).
There was a statistically significant association between UAS
and IL-6 concentration (p = 0.004). Median plasma IL-6 concentrations of CU patients with mild, moderate, and severe
symptoms were 39.45, 46.70 and 77.20 pg/ml, respectively (Figure 2). There was a statistically significant association
between mild, moderate and severe UAS and IL-6 levels
(p < 0.05, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively) (Figure 2).
There was a statistically significant association between DLQI
scores and IL-6 levels (p = 0.025). There was a statistically
significant association between mild, moderate, severe,
very severe DLQI scores and IL-6 levels and control group
(p = 0.002, p = 0.02, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively)
(Figure 3). There was no significant difference in median

DLOQI scores (p = 0.589, p = 0.111, p = 0.314, respectively).
There was only statistically meaningful difference between
the severe group and control group (p = 0.024). There was
no significant differences in median CRP levels between
ASST(+) and ASST(-) CU patients (0.358, 0.298 mg/dl;
p > 0.05) (Table 1). The UAS and DLQI were not meaningful with regard to history of angioedema (p = 0.089,
p = 0.911). No significant correlation was detected between circulating concentration of IL-6 and CRP (r=—0.167,
p > 0.05) in CU patients.

Discussion

 

The important role of mast cells in CU occurrence was
proven in previous studies [15]. It has been acknowledged
that tryptase-positive, chymase-negative mast cells might
serve as an important source of IL-6 in CU [16]. The IL-6 is
a cytokine involved in chronic stress states [17, 18]. It is
known that the increasing secretions of IL-6 occur during
various immune-inflammatory processes including hypersensitivity reactions and autoimmune diseases [18-20].
The IL-6 is an inducer of many acute phase proteins such
as the CRP, which controls the level of local and systemic
inflammatory responses [5, 21].

The CRP is a strong activator of the classical complement cascade and may start or exacerbate inflammatory lesions in this manner under certain conditions [22, 23].

Many studies on inflammatory conditions have demonstrated that although not in all diseases, in most cases the
CRP concentration was also parallel to the activity of the
disease such as IL-6 concentration. It is not clear whether
or not this increase in IL-6 and CRP is only an epiphenomenon or has contributed to the pathogenesis of CU [8].

Plasma IL-6 and serum CRP concentrations were recently investigated and IL-6 levels were found to be increased
in patients with urticaria. The meaningful relationship
with the disease activity score was only determined by
Kasperska-Zajac et al. but was not referred to in the study
of Dos Santos [6, 24, 25]. In comparison with the healthy conrols in our trial, plasma IL-6 concentration was notably higherin CU patients. Similar to the literature, there was an imporant correlation between the UAS and IL-6 concentration.

Kasperska-Zajac et al. have shown that the increased
L-6 plasma levels was a reversible phenomenon and have
shown that it increased in active disease periods and
decreased in remission [6]. The limitation of this study is
hat IL-6 levels of the patients during remission (either sponaneously or drug-induced) were not measured. It has been
suggested that mast cells may play a central role in disease syndromes with a neural, immune and endocrine comjonent exacerbated under stress [26]. It has been demon

strated that IL-6 is secreted upon psychological stress,
depression and other negative emotions [17, 27]. Because
it is known that IL-6 levels increase with stress, it cannot
be determined whether this increase is due to disease activity or emotions [8]. Symptoms of urticaria including pruritus and distressing lesions present as the source of physical and psychological distress [28, 29]. Baiardini et al.
reported a severe impairment of quality of life in CU patients
[30]. The DLO! and Skindex 16 are simple and practical validated instruments that can be used both in the office setting and for research purposes to quickly evaluate QOL
These tests are helpful to assess improvement in both the
physical and psychosocial aspects of a patient’s disease
(14, 31]. Lennox et al. demonstrated that the DLQI is a valid,
safe and clinically applicable test in assessment of life quality related to urticaria [32]. By assuming that psychological stress triggers high levels of IL-6 in CU patients, we investigated the relationship between IL-6 levels and the
uality of life. We determined that in the group with the
most severe UAS, IL-6 levels were the highest and the
patients’ quality of life was the worst. We came to the conclusion that IL-6 levels increase in connection with psychological stress. Increased levels of CRP were found in CU
patients [6, 33-35]. However, its relationship with the dis

in controlling disease symptoms.
