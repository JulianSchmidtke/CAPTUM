Introduction

Summary

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) pathogenesis shows a complex and
still unclear interplay between immunoglobulin (Ig)G- and IgE-mediated
autoimmunity, leading to mast cell and basophil degranulation and wheal
formation. The objective of this study was to evaluate at the same time
IgE- and IgG-reactivity to well recognized and recently reported autoantigens in CSU patients, and to assess the effects of such reactivity on response to the anti-IgE monoclonal antibody omalizumab. Twenty CSU
patients underwent omalizumab treatment. Urticaria activity score 7 (UAS7)
was recorded at baseline and at different drug administration time-points
for categorizing early-, late- or non-responders. At baseline, sera from the
20 patients and from 20 controls were tested for IgE and IgG autoantibodies to high- and low-affinity IgE receptors (FceRI and FceRII), tissue factor
(TF) and thyroglobulin (TG) by immunoenzymatic methods. Antibody levels
were compared with those of controls and analysed according to response.
Eighteen patients were omalizumab responders (11 early and seven late),
while two were non-responders. More than 50% of patients had contemporary IgE and IgG to at least to one of the four different autoantigens.
Late responders showed higher levels of both anti-TF IgE and IgG than
early responders (P = 0-011 and P = 0-035, respectively). Twenty-five per
cent of patients had levels of anti-FceRI IgE, exceeding the upper normal
limit, suggesting that it could be a novel auto-allergen in CSU. In CSU,
there is an autoimmune milieu characterized by the co-existence of IgE
and IgG autoantibodies to the same antigen/allergen, particularly in late
responders to omalizumab, possibly explaining the slower response.

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), defined as the recurrent occurrence of wheals sometimes associated with angioedema for more than 6 weeks, is a common and potentially
disabling disease. The long-term uncertainty that has surrounded its pathogenesis is gradually clearing. The finding,
some 20-30 years ago, of functionally active immunoglobulin (Ig)G autoantibodies to the high-affinity IgE receptor
(FceRI) or to IgE but only in a minority of patients with
CSU [1-4] has, in more recent years, been reached by the
detection of IgE class autoantibodies, first to thyroid peroxidase [5] and subsequently to a number of autoallergens

ing has provided a solid rationale for the very rapid response
to omalizumab, a humanized anti-IgE monoclonal antibody
(mAb), which is observed in a large proportion of patients
with severe CSU. The co-existence of both IgG-mediated
(type IIb after Gell and Coombs) autoimmunity and of
IgE-mediated (type I) autoimmunity in patients with CSU
and its effect on omalizumab response has not been investigated so far. In the present study, we measured IgE and
IgG reactivity to four autoantigens in patients with CSU:
two well-recognized, such as high- and low-affinity IgE

receptors (FceRI and FceRII) and two recently reported,
such as TF and TG.

Patients and methods

Patients

Twenty patients (three male, 17 female; median age =
53-5 years, min 24-max 80 years) with severe CSU
(UAS7 > 25) underwent subcutaneous omalizumab treatment at a dose of 300 g/month following the indications
of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical
Immunology (EAACI) guidelines [8]. Patients were evaluated at baseline and 1, 3 and 4 months after omalizumab
treatment initiation and UAS7 was recorded at each timepoint in order to categorize the patients into early-, lateor non-responders. Clinical response was considered as
early if it occurred within 4 weeks after the first administration with reduction of UAS7 to at least < 6, late if
the response was observed within 3 months with a reduction to at least < 6, or absent (symptoms remaining
unchanged 1 month after the third administration) [9].

The clinical response to omalizumab is depicted in
Table 1. Eighteen (90%) patients were considered omalizumab responders; 11 were early responders and seven
were late responders. Two patients did not show any
response to the drug.

At baseline, sera from the 20 CSU patients and from
20 sex- and age-matched healthy controls were studied
for IgE and IgG autoantibodies specific for TE, TG, highaffinity IgE receptor (FceRI) and low-affinity IgE receptor
(FceRII). The antigens to be tested were chosen: (i) in
view of the well-known association of CSU with IgGmediated thyroid autoimmunity [10] together with the
more recently described IgE thyroid autoreactivity [5,7];
(ii) in order to detect whether the high- and the lowaffinity IgE receptors might represent a direct target for
IgE-mediated autoimmune responses, as is the case with
the well-known IgG autoimmunity [3,11]; and (iii) in consideration of all the recent work showing the activation
of the coagulation cascade in patients with severe CSU,
with the aim of detecting whether IgE autoallergy to TF
(the main initiator of coagulation) may occur in CSU [12].
In both patients and controls, endocrine and coagulation

diseases were ruled out; thyroid hormone levels as well
as anti-nuclear, anti-extractable nuclear antigen and antidsDNA antibodies were normal or negative. In both groups,
atopic status was excluded based on clinical history (absence
of atopic symptoms). Moreover, in CSU patients, an accurate
diagnostic work-up was performed, including skin-prick
tests with commercial extracts of the most common airborne allergens and foods. Total IgE, measured by an
immunoenzymatic method, were 186 kUA/I (19-1027 kUA/I)
in patients and 40 kUA/I (4-102 KUA/I) in controls.

The study was conducted following the ethical principles
of the Declaration of Helsinki, regulatory requirements
and the code of Good Clinical Practice. Patients and controls gave an informed written consent to the use of their
sera and relative data. The local review board approved
the study.

Detection of specific IgE and IgG

Anti-TE, anti-TG, anti- FceRI and anti- FceRII IgE and
IgG autoantibodies were measured by sandwich enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Each antigen [TF
(recombinant TF; Haematologic Technologies Inc., Essex,
VT, USA); TG (human TG; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA);
FceRI (human FcERI; Sino Biological, Wayne, PA, USA)
and FceRII (recombinant human CD23; Abcam, Cambridge,
UK)] was coated overnight onto microtitration plates at
a concentration of 10 j1g/ml and, after washing, the residual
binding sites were blocked with bovine serum albumin 1%.
After further washes, plasma dilutions (1 : 10, 1 : 100
and 1 : 1000) from patients and controls were added and
incubated for 45 min at room temperature. After washing,
goat anti-human IgE (e chain-specific) (Sigma) was added
for the determination of specific IgE and, after further
washing, peroxidase-conjugated donkey polyclonal antigoat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Dallas, TX, USA)
was added. For the determination of specific total IgG,
we added a goat anti-human IgG (y-chain-specific) horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (Sigma); after further
washing, rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse IgG peroxidaseconjugated was added. All the reactions were revealed by
ortho-phenylenediamine (Sigma). As cut-off levels, we
adopted the highest value recorded among normal controls
for each assay; levels exceeding that value among patients
were regarded as positive.

Statistical analysis

The results are expressed as median and ranges (min-max).
The non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test for unpaired
values was used to assess statistical significance of differences between groups. Significance level was set at P < 0-05.
The sample size was calculated in order to obtain a statistical
power of 80%, with an alpha error of 5%, based on two
previous studies. The first, by Ulambayar et al. [13], showed
54% higher levels of IgG anti-FceRI in patients with CSU
than in normal controls, while the second, by Cugno et al.
[7], showed more than 111% higher levels of IgE anti-TF
and anti-TG in CSU patients than in normal controls.

Data were analysed using the spss PC statistical package version 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).

TE IgE levels did not differ between patients [median = 498

optical density (OD) (min-max = 73-1597 OD)] and controls [363 OD (min-max = 50-475 OD)] (P = not significant
(n.s.). However, within the patient group, late responders
showed significantly higher levels of anti-TF IgE [815 OD
(min-max = 168-1597 OD)] than early responders [415
OD (min-max = 87-806 OD)] (P = 0-011). The two nonresponders showed very low levels of TF IgE.

Median TF IgG levels were higher in patients [314 OD
(min-max = 84-1956 OD)] than in controls [197 OD
(min-max = 11-343 OD)], although probably due to small
numbers the difference did not reach statistical significance
(P = 0-051). Again, marked differences were found within
the patient group, as in late omalizumab responders TF
IgG levels were significantly higher [559 OD (minmax = 148-1956 OD)] than in early responders [253 OD
(min-max = 84-161 OD)] (P = 0-035). Again, the two
non-responders did not show any TF IgG autoreactivity.

responders showed slightly higher levels of TF IgE [408
OD (min-max 172-800 OD)] than early responders
[261 OD (min-max = 163-2034 OD)], although without
reaching statistical significance due to the presence of two
outliers in the group of early responders. Non-responders
did not show any IgE reactivity to TG.

Median TG IgG was higher in patients [509 OD (minmax = 50-3231 OD)] than in controls [252 OD (minmax = 55-412 OD)], although the difference did not reach
statistical significance (P = 0-054). Late responders [418 OD
(min-max = 50-1227 OD)] and early responders [413 OD
(min-max = 61-3231 OD)] showed similar median levels
of TG IgG. Interestingly, both patients not responding to
omalizumab showed elevated levels of IgG to TG.

levels exceeding the upper limit of controls. FceRI IgE
levels did not differ in the three subgroups of patients.

Median FceRI IgG levels were significantly higher in
patients [190 OD (min-max = 1-1526 OD)] than in controls [77 OD (min-max = 6-173 OD)] (P = 0-032). Late
responders showed significantly higher levels of anti- FceRI
IgG [669 OD (min-max 140-1526 OD)] than early
responders [85 OD (min-max = 26-426 OD)] (P = 0-004)
and non-responders.

FceRII IgE and IgG autoreactivity is depicted in Fig. 4.
Median FceRII IgE levels were similar in patients [284
OD (min-max = 183-406 OD)] and controls [272 OD

IgE levels did not differ between late [286 OD (minmax = 205-406 OD)], early [304 OD (min-max = 183-361
OD)] and non-responders.

Median FceRII IgG levels were higher in patients [348
OD (min-max = 67-609 OD)] than in controls [235 OD
(min-max = 176-387 OD)] although, probably due to the
small number of patients, the difference did not reach the

group, late omalizumab responders showed higher FceRII
IgG levels [394 OD (min-max = 292-609 OD)] than early
responders [272 OD (min-max = 206-522 OD)] (P = 0-05).

Overview of the results in individual patients

The results of the serological investigation in individual
patients are shown in Table 2. Only two of 20 (10%)
patients did not show specific IgE or IgG to any of the
four autoantigens studied. Notably, both responded
promptly to omalizumab therapy. Ten of 20 (50%) patients
showed the contemporary presence of IgE and IgG reactivity to different autoantigens.

Sixteen of 20 (80%) patients signs of
IgG-mediated autoimmunity to at least one of the four

showed

antigens tested; seven, seven and two of these showed an
early, late or non-response to omalizumab, respectively.

Thirteen of 20 (65%) patients showed IgE-mediated
autoimmunity to at least one of the antigens studied; seven
and six of these showed an early or late response to
omalizumab, respectively. None of the two non-responders
showed autoreactive IgE.

Of 10 patients showing IgG to the high affinity IgE
receptor, six and one were late- and non-responders to
omalizumab, respectively.

Five patients showed IgG reactivity against the low
affinity IgE receptor FceRII (CD23).

Discussion

The existence of IgG-mediated autoimmune processes in
a proportion of patients with CSU has been known for
30 years. Much more recent is the observation that chronic
urticaria patients may show auto-allergic, IgE-mediated

events [5-7]. In this study, we looked for both IgE and
IgG directed against four autoantigens possibly involved
in the pathogenesis of CSU. One potential drawback of
our study is the limited number of antigens studied, as
Schmetzer et al. recently showed IgE autoreactivity to
hundreds of auto-allergens in patients with CSU [6].
Thus, we cannot exclude that the autoimmune response,
which was already detected in 90% of our cases (18 of
20; Table 2), was possibly directed against a much larger
array of autoantigens and was present in virtually all
the population. Another limit of this study is the low
number of patients enrolled, but due to cost limitations
we were unable to investigate a broader population.
Our main finding is that approximately half of our
CSU patients (11 of 20) showed the contemporaneous
presence of both IgE and IgG autoantibodies directed
against the same antigen/allergen or against distinct targets.
This finding may potentially increase our understanding
of the immunological events occurring in CSU, but at

the same time clearly shows the complexity of the pathogenesis of this disease.

In CSU patients a prompt omalizumab response has
been associated with elevated total IgE levels [14-17]
and with an elevated expression of high-affinity IgE receptor on effector cells [18,19]. Conversely, IgG autoimmunity
has been associated with a slow or absent response to
the drug [9,20]. Thus, it is clearly possible that the contemporary presence of both IgE and IgG class autoantibodies renders the response to the drug unpredictable
in the single patient and probably dependent on a fine
balance between the two types of autoimmune response,
or on the specific clinical effect of these autoantibodies.
For instance, in our population 70% of patients showing
IgG autoantibodies to the high-affinity IgE receptor, FceRI,
responded slowly or did not respond at all to omalizumab.
This is in keeping with the recent observation that omalizumab is able to bind not only circulating IgE, but also
IgE fixed to the high-affinity receptor and to detach them

from the receptor [21], which leads (in a long term) to
a down-regulation of the receptor and a probable later
response to the drug. In fact, a lower number of highaffinity IgE receptors is available for activation by specific
IgG autoantibodies. Interestingly, both patients who did
not show IgE or IgG to any of the studied allergens
responded promptly to omalizumab; this might suggest
the presence of an autoimmune IgE response to an allergen other than those studied here [6].

The finding of IgE- and IgG-mediated responses to TF,
the main activator of the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade, represents a link (and possibly the sign
of an interplay) between the activation of the coagulation/
fibrinolysis system and the auto-allergic/autoimmune pathways of the disease [7]. Although the effective clinical
relevance of these autoantibodies has to be more clearly
defined in future studies, it is nonetheless of interest that
late responders to omalizumab showed significantly higher
levels of both IgG and IgE to TF than early responders,
suggesting that autoreactive autoantibodies levels might
influence the pattern of response to omalizumab. TF is
expressed mainly by eosinophils and endothelial cells
[22,23], and eosinophils may be activated upon stimulation of the low-affinity IgE receptor. A quarter of our
patients showed IgG against FceRII, confirming previous
findings by Puccetti et al [24]. This mechanism may provide an alternative pathway leading to histamine release
from mast cells and basophils.

We detected IgE specific for the high-affinity IgE receptor in six cases, indicating that FceRI could be a novel

auto-allergen in patients with CSU [6,7]. The in-vivo relevance of these autoantibodies remains unclear, and
deserves further investigation. However, they could be
directly functionally active, causing the direct cross-link
of high-affinity IgE receptors with their antigen binding
fragment (as is the case for FceRI IgG), or might induce
mast cell degranulation when fixed to the receptor by the
Fe domain after binding of free FceRI, or both events
may occur at the same time.

In conclusion, we have detected autoimmune responses
sustained by both IgE and IgG antibody classes in more
than half of patients with CSU. Such autoimmune responses
may co-exist and possibly influence the clinical response
to anti-IgE therapy. Further studies are needed to assess
the clinical relevance of single autoantibodies in the disease
of single CSU patients.
