Abstract

Omalizumab is very effective in the majority of patients with
severe chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), but its mechanism of action is still unclear. In CSU the coagulation cascade
is activated with an intensity that parallels the disease severity, and elevated plasma D-dimer levels are associated with
a poor response to both antihistamines and cyclosporin. We
measured D-dimer plasma levels before and after the first
administration of omalizumab in 32 patients with severe
CSU. A number of clinical and laboratory parameters were
recorded, including the urticaria activity score, presence of
angioedema, disease duration, C-reactive protein, anti-nuclear, and anti-thyroid antibodies. Baseline D-dimer levels
were elevated in 19 (59%) cases. Omalizumab induced a
complete response in 25 patients (78%), in most cases already after the first administration. At baseline, 14/25 responders had increased D-dimer plasma levels versus 5/7
non-responders. All responders showed a dramatic decrease
of D-dimer plasma levels after the first administration of the
drug (from 1,024 + 248 [mean + SE] to 251 + 30 ng/mL; p=
0.003). In contrast, non-responders did not show any reduc
tionin D-dimer levels after omalizumab administration (from
787 + 206 to 1,230 + 429 ng/mL; p = ns). In conclusion, plasma levels of D-dimer are frequently elevated in patients with
severe CSU before omalizumab administration and decrease
according to the clinical response of the disease to the drug,
suggesting a possible effect of omalizumab on coagulation
activation and fibrin degradation in a subset of CSU patients.

Introduction

During the last 10 years a number of case reports and
case series along with 3 phase III studies [1-3] and a reallife study [4] have shown that the humanised monoclonal
anti-IgE antibody omalizumab is effective in patients
with severe chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) not responding to antihistamines at higher than licensed doses.
However, despite its often prompt efficacy, there are a
proportion of patients ranging between 7 and 48% who
do not show a satisfying response to the drug [5]. Interestingly, most of these omalizumab-unresponsive patients were corticosteroid-responsive before, whereas in
other cases patients may become omalizumab-resistant
over time [6, 7]. The reasons why some patients fail to

respond to anti-IgE treatment are still unclear, but this
highlights the fact that several distinct pathways, all eventually leading to histamine release from mast cells and
basophils, might play a role in the pathogenesis of the
disease and that the relative relevance of such pathways
may change from one patient to another or even in the
same patient in different phases of the disease. Recent
studies found that the coagulation cascade is activated via
the extrinsic pathway in CSU, and that the intensity of
such activation parallels disease severity [8-10]. Furthermore, it has been shown that elevated plasma D-dimer
levels are associated with a poor response to both antihistamines and cyclosporine [11, 12]. In the present study,
we measured D-dimer plasma levels before and after the
first administration of omalizumab in patients with severe CSU and analysed the results in the light of clinical
response to the treatment.

Patients and Methods

Patients

Thirty-two subjects (mean age 50 years, range 17-78 years; M/F
11/21) with severe CSU (urticaria activity score [UAS 7] >30; mean
disease duration 43.1 months, range 2-120) unresponsive to second generation antihistamines at higher than licensed doses [13]
were studied. A course of subcutaneous omalizumab 300 mg every
4 weeks for 3 months was started in all patients. The presence of
angioedema and disease exacerbations induced by non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were recorded, and thyroid
autoantibodies, anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), C-reactive protein
(CRP), and the fibrin fragment D-dimer were measured before the
start of omalizumab therapy. D-dimer plasma levels were remeasured 3 weeks after the first dose of omalizumab, and the results
were analysed in terms of the clinical response to the drug.

Plasma from 30 healthy subjects (10 men and 20 women, median age 54 years, range 20-76) undergoing routine check-up investigations served as normal controls. For blood sampling, sodium citrate anti-coagulated plasma samples taken from all patients
and normal subjects were stored in Falcon tubes at -20°C until in
vitro assay.

All patients agreed with the treatment regimen and signed a
written consent form. Control subjects provided written consent
to the use of their serum/plasma in an anonymous form for research purposes. Since all treatments and investigations were carried out within the standard routine management of CSU patients,
in view of the purely observational nature of the study, no formal
approval by the local ethical committee was required.

Methods

D-dimer levels were measured by means of ELISA (Zymutest
D-Dimer; Hyphen BioMed, Neuville-sur-Oise, France) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were 10 and 15%, respectively. Levels
below 500 ng/mL were regarded as normal. The CRP plasma concentration was measured using a sandwich enzyme immunoassay

 

D-Dimer Response to Omalizumab in
CSU

(Zymutest CRP, Hyphen BioMed). Intra- and interassay variability was lower than 11%.

ANA were tested by indirect immunofluorescence on HEp2
cells; samples were considered positive at a dilution >1:160. Antithyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies were measured with commercial immunoenzymatic methods (NovaTec,
Dietzenbach, Germany).

Statistics

We assessed differences using the paired sample t test and associations using the x? test and logistic regression analysis. The
level of significance was set at p < 0.05. The data were analysed using the SPSS PC statistical package, version 22.00 (IBM SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA).

Results

Table 1 summarises the demographic, clinical, and
laboratory features of the 32 CSU patients enrolled in the
study. Twelve patients (37.5 %) had a history of angioedema episodes associated with urticaria, and 4 (12.5%)
had a history of severe urticaria exacerbations after taking
cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1)-inhibiting NSAIDs. At baseline (before omalizumab treatment) 5 patients showed
positive ANA (speckled pattern in 4 cases, nucleolar in 1
case), 8 (25%) showed thyroid autoimmunity, and 10
showed elevated CRP. Baseline D-dimer levels were elevated (>500 ng/mL) in 19 (59%) cases. Omalizumab induced a complete (UAS 7 = 0) or almost complete (UAS
7 = 1-14) response in 24 patients (75%), in most cases
already after the first administration of the drug. Most of
these patients reported a marked improvement as quickly as 3-7 days after the shot. One patient reported a partial
response (UAS dropped to 15-21) after the first administration, whereas 7 patients (22%) showed a poor response
or did not show any response to the drug after the first
administration and did not improve thereafter. The lack
of response to omalizumab was not associated with any
specific clinical or baseline laboratory parameter (age,
sex, disease duration, NSAID hypersensitivity, thyroid
autoimmunity, or positive ANA). When examining
omalizumab response as a function of baseline D-dimer
plasma levels, it turned out that 15/19 (79%) of those
showing elevated D-dimer and 9/13 (69%) of those showing normal baseline D-dimer levels showed a complete
response to omalizumab (p = ns). In all responders, Ddimer plasma levels showed a dramatic decrease after
only the first administration of omalizumab (from 1,024
+ 248 [mean + SE] to 251 + 30 ng/mL; p = 0.003), and in
the majority of patients D-dimer levels fell within the normal range (Fig. 1). In contrast, non-responders did not

higher D-dimer plasma levels (1,563 + 467 ng/mL) than
CSU patients without angioedema (618 + 96 ng/mL; p =

Discussion

The mechanism of action of omalizumab in CSU is not
clearly understood. It has been suggested that most of its
clinical effects rely on the downregulation of the high affinity IgE receptor on mast cells and basophils, which
eventually leads to a reduced activation and to a decrease
or stop of degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators from these cells [14]. Such effects require 3-4
weeks to occur, at least on mast cells, which is far longer
than the few days frequently needed to appreciate a

marked decrease in urticaria severity score. Thus, other
mechanisms with a more rapid action are possibly also
involved. In fact, omalizumab exerts a number of other
effects [5] at different levels, including those on the coagulation cascade, which may lead to a marked reduction
of D-dimer plasma levels [15]. Furthermore, omalizumab
has been shown to induce the apoptosis of eosinophils
16], a cell type that we recently found to be the initiator
of the activation of the coagulation cascade in chronic uricaria by the hyper-expression of tissue factor [17]. The
pathogenic roles of thrombin and other coagulation facors in CSU are still debated. One possibility is that the
activation of the coagulation cascade non-specifically
mirrors the general inflammatory state that underlies the
disease. However, if this were the case, one would expect
‘o find elevated D-dimer plasma levels in all patients with
severe, antihistamine-resistant urticaria. In contrast, as
he subjects with severe CSU investigated in this study
show, D-dimer plasma levels are elevated only in a proportion of cases (60% in our population), which suggests
hat the activation of the coagulation cascade may represent a potential pathogenic mechanism in a specific subset, but not in all CSU patients. In animal models, thrombin and other coagulation factors have been shown to induce mast cell degranulation with a potency similar to
that of FceRI-mediated activation via the so-called protease-activated receptors 1 and 2 (PAR-1 and PAR-2) [18],
and we cannot rule out that such a mechanism is active in
a proportion of patients with CSU.

In accordance with previous studies [1-4], omalizumab was effective in the majority of patients with severe
CSU but not in the totality of patients. In our hands, the

drug was equally effective in patients showing elevated or
normal baseline plasma levels of D-dimer. However, in
those showing elevated baseline D-dimer levels the clinical response to the drug was paralleled by a rapid and impressive decrease of coagulation activation [9], whereas in
treatment failures D-dimer levels remained unchanged
or even increased during the treatment. The longer we
investigate CSU, looking at clinical expression, pathophysiological aspects, and response to therapies, the higher is the number of different phenotypes that seemingly
characterise this complex disease. It is possible that the
activation of the coagulation cascade characterises one
specific phenotype strictly paralleling the state of activity
of the disease in these subjects and possibly playing a
pathogenic role as well.
