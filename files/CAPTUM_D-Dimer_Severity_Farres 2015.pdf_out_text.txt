KEYWORDS Abstract

Chronic urticaria; Background: The pathogenesis of chronic urticaria is incompletely understood. There is growing
Coagulation; interest in the role of the coagulation cascade in chronic urticaria. We aimed to assess the
D-dimer; possible activation of the coagulation cascade in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in relation
Extrinsic pathway; to disease severity and activity.

Factor VII; Methods: This study was conducted on 30 patients with active CSU and 30 apparently healthy
Fibrinolysis individuals as controls. Patients with acute urticaria, physical urticaria, or any form of urticaria

other than spontaneous urticaria were excluded. Plasma levels of D-dimer and activated factor
VII (FVIla) were measured by ELISA at baseline for all recruited patients and controls. In addition,
they were measured for CSU patients after complete disease remission.

Results: Plasma levels of D-dimer and FVila were significantly higher among patients with active
CSU than among healthy controls. D-dimer levels were lowest among patients with grade 1 severity and highest among those with grade 4 severity. Factor Vlla levels did not differ significantly
according to disease severity grades. After complete disease remission, there was a significant
dramatic drop in levels of D-dimer and FVila among patients.

Conclusion: We conclude that activation of the coagulation cascade occurs in CSU, and we
demonstrate the novel finding that activated factor VII levels are significantly reduced after
medical therapy, confirming the implication of the extrinsic pathway activation in CSU. Future
controlled studies may investigate the role of anticoagulant therapy in refractory chronic
urticaria.

Introduction age, 29.57 + 8.76 years), and 30 apparently healthy individ
Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common disorder presenting as
cutaneous wheals with or without angio-oedema for more
than six weeks, occurring on a continuous or recurrent basis
over prolonged periods of time and caused by release of
vasoactive mediators from mast cells within the dermis.!
Urticaria can be classified into a subtype in which eliciting factors are recognisable (including physical, aquagenic,
cholinergic, contact and exercise-induced urticaria), and
the subtype of spontaneous urticaria in which the wheals
occur without any obvious stimulus and are not triggered by
eliciting factors.”

The pathogenesis of CU is poorly understood. Several factors have been advocated as causes of the disease, including
emotional disorders, food allergy, intolerance to food additives and chronic infections like Helicobacter pylori.’ In
30-50% of cases, autoimmune processes have been suggested as causative factors.* Some interleukins, such as IL17 and IL-23, which have been detected previously in various
autoimmune diseases, have been demonstrated to be signi
icantly increased in serum of patients with CU.° Changes in
serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone and prolactin hormones have also been demonstrated in CU patients.°”

Evidence has accumulated for the possible involvement
of the coagulation cascade in the pathogenesis of CSU. It
has been demonstrated that CSU is associated with the
generation of thrombin, the last enzyme of the coagulation cascade, and that the severity of the disease is
paralleled by the amount of thrombin generated.® Thrombin is a serine protease involved in haemostasis as well
as in vessel wound healing, revascularisation, and tissue remodelling.'® Thrombin causes oedema by increasing
vascular permeability and by triggering the degranulation
of mast cells.'' Most effects of thrombin are histaminemediated (and hence mast cell-mediated), as they have
been reported to be reduced by antihistamines and mast cell
granule depletion in animal models. '? Once thrombin is generated, it acts on fibrinogen, which is converted into fibrin.
Fibrin degradation (fibrinolysis) then occurs, leading to an
increase in D-dimer, a breakdown product formed by fibrin
degradation.’ An increase in plasma levels of D-dimer thus
indicates markedly pronounced activation of coagulation,
and its absence implies that thrombosis is not occurring.
Negative D-dimer assays have an important role in excluding
any diagnosis of coagulation."?

In the coagulation cascade, thrombin is generated from
prothrombin by activated factor X. The two pathways that
initiate blood coagulation and lead to the activation of
factor X are the contact (intrinsic) and the tissue factor
(extrinsic) pathways. Factor VII is the first factor of the
extrinsic pathway. It forms a complex with the membranebound tissue factor in the presence of Ca**; this complex
activates primarily factor X.'*

In the present study, we aimed to assess the possible activation of the coagulation cascade in chronic spontaneous
urticaria, and its relation to disease severity and activity.

 

 

Materials and methods

This case-control study was conducted on 30 patients with
chronic spontaneous urticaria (male/female, 12/18; mean

 

 

uals as controls (male/female, 12/18; mean age, 25.9 + 7.08
years). Patients were recruited from the Allergy and Dermatology outpatient clinics at Ain Shams University Hospitals,
and were symptomatic with active chronic urticaria (CU)
at the time of their enrolment. CU was diagnosed on the
basis of the appearance of continuous or recurrent hives
with or without angio-oedema for more than six weeks. '>
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) was diagnosed after
exclusion of all identifiable factors.'° Patients with acute
urticaria, physical urticaria, or any form of urticaria other
than spontaneous urticaria were excluded. Viral, bacterial,
and parasitic infections were excluded on the basis of clinical history and appropriate investigations. Skin test was
performed to exclude allergic causes of urticaria. Further
exclusion criteria included patients with co-morbid systemic diseases, patients on regular anticoagulant therapy,
patients who had been on systemic steroid therapy within six
weeks before recruitment and patients who had been receiving antihistamines within five days before recruitment. An
informed consent was obtained from all study participants
prior to conducting the study, and the study was approved
by the Research Ethics Committee of Ain Shams University.

 

Grading of disease severity

Disease severity was assessed according to the number of wheals present at the time when blood samples
were collected, as follows: 1-10 small (<3cm in diameter) wheals=grade 1 (slight); 10-50 small wheals or 1-10
large wheals=grade 2 (moderate); >50 small wheals or
>10 large wheals = grade 3 (severe); virtually covered with
wheals = grade 4 (very severe). '”

D-dimer and activated factor VII (FVIla)

Plasma levels of D-dimer and FVIla were measured for all
recruited patients and controls. In addition, they were measured for CSU patients after complete disease remission. For
remission criteria, we established that patients must have
been without urticarial lesions for a minimum period of four
weeks and under medical treatment according to the recent
standard practice guidelines. '°

D-dimer assay

This was performed by ELISA (Zymutest D-dimer; Hyphen
BioMed, Neuville-sur-Oise, France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. According to this kit, the expected
D-dimer concentration in normal human plasma is usually
<500 ng/ml.

FVila assay

This was performed by ELISA (Zymutest Factor VII; Hyphen
BioMed, Neuville-sur-Oise, France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. According to this kit, the expected
Factor Vila concentration in normal human adult plasma is
usually in the range 70-130%.

Statistical analysis

Analysis of data was performed using the SPSS program, version 12. Data were expressed as mean + standard deviation
(SD) for parametric data, and as median and interquartile
range (IQR) for non-parametric data, respectively. Parametric data were analysed using Student’s t-test for the
comparison of two groups. Non-parametric data were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests to
compare two and three groups, respectively. Mann-Whitney
U test was used as a post hoc test if the Kruskal-Wallis test
was significant. Chi-square test was used to analyse categorical data. To analyse non-parametric paired data, Wilcoxon
signed ranks test was used. A p-value of less than 0.05 was
considered significant.

 

Results

The present study included 30 patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria and 30 healthy controls. Age and gender
were comparable between both study groups (p=0.08,
p=1.0 for age and gender, respectively). Among patients
with CSU, severity grades were 1 among five patients
(16.7%), 2 among 13 patients (43.3%), 3 among nine patients
(30%), and 4 among three patients (10%). The mean age
of onset of CSU was 25.3+7.8 years. Duration of disease
ranged from 0.5 to 15 years, with a median (interquartile
range) of 2.0 (1.0, 6.5) years.

 

D-dimer and FVlla at baseline

Plasma levels of D-dimer and FVlla were significantly higher
among patients with active CSU than among healthy controls (Figs. 1 and 2, respectively). There was a significant
difference in D-dimer levels across the different grades of
disease severity among CSU patients. D-dimer levels were
lowest among patients with grade 1 severity and highest
among patients with grade 4 severity. On the other hand,

D-dimer and FVlla after remission

Among 25 patients who were available after remission, there
was a significant dramatic drop in levels of D-dimer [median
(IQR), 487.5 (343.75, 625.0)ng/mL, p<0.001], and FVlila
[median (IQR), 200 (150, 300) %, p<0.001] among patients
with CSU (Fig. 3).

D-dimer and FVlla according to the treatment
modality

We compared levels of D-dimer and FVila after complete remission between patients who required nonsedating H,-antihistamines (nsAH) only, patients who
required nsAH at higher doses, and patients who required
nsAH + antileukotrienes. We observed a rising trend in Ddimer levels according to the treatment modality. However,
this trend did not reach statistical significance (Table 2).

Discussion

In the present study, we assessed the activation of the
coagulation cascade in patients with CSU. The mean age
of patients was 29.6+8.8 years, which is similar to that
reported in Egyptian studies on CSU (30 and 32 years),'®!?
and which corresponds to the peak age of CSU in most international studies (between 20 and 40 years). '°

We observed that levels of D-dimer were significantly
higher among patients with CSU than among healthy controls. Furthermore, D-dimer levels were lowest among
patients with mild disease and highest among patients with
severe disease.

A number of investigators have demonstrated significantly higher plasma D-dimer levels in CSU patients than
in controls, as well as a significant association between Ddimer levels and the severity of disease.?'®7°-?2

We also evaluated the activation of the extrinsic pathway
of coagulation in patients with CSU by measuring activated
factor VII (FVlla), and observed that FVlla levels were significantly higher among patients with CSU than among healthy
controls.

Few studies have investigated the possible activation of
the extrinsic pathway of coagulation in chronic spontaneous
urticaria. Asero et al. demonstrated an increase in plasma
FVila but not FXlla (a factor of the intrinsic pathway) among
patients with CSU.’ A Chinese study demonstrated significantly increased levels of FVIla and D-dimer in plasma of

30 CSU patients in comparison to 30 healthy controls. They
also showed that prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were in the normal range in CSU
patients, demonstrating that although the coagulation cascade is clearly activated in CSU, thrombin generation and
secondary fibrinolysis are in a dynamic balance, resulting in
PT and APTT normalisation.”? Further support for activation
of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation can be derived from
the strong expression of tissue factor (TF), an initiator of the
extrinsic pathway, by eosinophils and upper dermal inflammatory cells from urticarial skin lesions but not from normal
skin.?4 The role of eosinophils in tissue factor-expression
among CSU patients is further supported by a recent study,
which demonstrated that serum eotaxin, which plays a vital
role in recruitment and activation of eosinophils in the skin
of CU patients, was significantly higher in CSU patients than
in healthy controls.”> The previous studies highlight a role
for activation of the extrinsic pathway among patients with
CSU. On the other hand, other investigators have observed
no significant difference in levels of FVila between CSU
patients or healthy controls.227°

Inflammation is the link between the immune and the
coagulation system. Pro-inflammatory cytokines including
interleukin 1, interleukin 6 and tumour necrosis factor
alpha, induce the expression of TF, which activates factor VII. This catalyses the activation of the TF pathway of
coagulation resulting in the generation of thrombin.’” The
sequence of aetiological events in CSU is still incompletely

Activation of coagulation in chronic urticaria

 

understood. It remains unclear whether the activation of
coagulation and/or fibrinolysis in CSU is the primary cause of
wheal formation or is the secondary result of the release of
histamine and other mediators from mast cells. The former
possibility is supported by findings of symptomatic improvement in CSU patients by warfarin and heparin.”®2? On the
other hand, some patients with acute urticaria, idiopathic
angio-oedema or inducible types of urticaria also exhibited an elevation of D-dimer levels,?' which may suggest
that the activation of the coagulation cascade is a common phenomenon in urticaria and may not be specific to
CSU, and therefore might be a secondary event caused by
the activation of mast cells. Also in support of the latter
possibility is the likelihood that endothelial cells in CSU
may be activated by autoantibodies, cytokines, complement, histamine and other mast cell-derived factors; this
process may be responsible for TF expression, and secondary
extrinsic coagulation pathway activation and fibrinolysis.?
In line with endothelial cell activation in CSU, Puxeddu
et al. have recently detected that biomarkers of endothelium dysfunction (sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1) were increased
in a large number of patients with CSU, in addition to
other chemokines (such as CCL5/RANTES) that contribute
to the amplification of the inflammatory process during the
late phase of urticaria. CCL5/RANTES is a potent chemoattractant protein for T cells, eosinophils, and monocytes,
whereas adhesion molecules (sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1) play an
important role in the migration of inflammatory cells to the
site of inflammation.*°

It is apparently contradictory that patients with CSU do
not seem to be at risk for thrombotic events, despite the
increased activation of the coagulation system. Activation
of coagulation in inflammatory diseases without thrombotic
effect suggests that the activation of coagulation components may be pathophysiologically independent of thrombus
formation. The activation of the coagulation/fibrinolysis
cascade may occur extravascularly in these patients after
extravasation of plasma coagulation factors into the dermis, and once the cascade is activated, thrombin becomes
inactivated by tissue anti-thrombin Ill, thus not affecting
plasma anti-thrombin III activity.*"

Only a few relevant studies have compared factors of
coagulation/fibrinolysis in plasma of CSU patients during
disease activity with their corresponding levels after remission. Asero et al. demonstrated a reduction in plasma
levels of D-dimer during remission in two patients; one
patient after one week of therapy; and another patient
after one year, while he was not assuming any therapy.’
Two Japanese studies on CSU patients also demonstrated
significant reductions in plasma D-dimer levels after disease
remission.?'"*!

In the present study, we were able to follow up 25 of
our recruited patients with active CSU till complete disease
remission, and similar to the previous studies, we observed
that levels of D-dimer among these patients showed a significant dramatic reduction after remission, as compared
to their levels at baseline. We also report the novel finding that FVila levels in plasma were significantly reduced
after remission. These observations confirm that activation
of coagulation and fibrinolysis occurs in CSU patients due to
the activation of the extrinsic pathway, and is significantly
related to the activity of the disease.

The clear association between coagulation/fibrinolysis
and CSU paves the way for the conduction of clinical trials
with anticoagulants. Clinical trials using warfarin or heparin
among CSU patients not responding to antihistamine therapy have demonstrated improvement in at least two-thirds
of the studied patients.”®*23? However, these studies were
small and were conducted on fewer than 10 patients. Larger,
blinded, randomised controlled clinical trials are required
to evaluate the efficacy of anticoagulants in selected CSU
patients who are unresponsive to antihistamine therapy. *“

In the present study, a trend of rising D-dimer levels
was observed in association with increasing modalities of
therapy. D-dimer levels after remission were highest among
patients who required antihistamines in high doses plus
antileukotrienes, as compared to those who required lower
doses of antihistamines. However, this trend did not reach
statistical significance. This finding warrants further largescale studies; in addition, studies are needed to assess levels
of coagulation factors between responders and patients who
are refractory to conventional therapy.

Our study has limitations. We did not perform autologous
serum or plasma skin test (APST) to assess autoreactivity
among patients with CSU. In a recent study, the coagulation cascade has been demonstrated to be activated in CU
patients even with a negative APST, although to a lesser
extent than in patients with CU and a positive APST. It has
been suggested that activation of the coagulation system in
CU occurs irrespectively of the APST status. *°

In conclusion, our study results confirm that activation of
coagulation and fibrinolysis occurs in patients with chronic
spontaneous urticaria, and is related to both the severity
and activity of the disease. We demonstrate for the first time
that activated factor VII, a factor of the extrinsic pathway,
was significantly reduced after medical therapy, further confirming the implication of the extrinsic pathway activation
in chronic spontaneous urticaria. Further large-scale controlled studies are needed to evaluate the possible role of
anticoagulant therapy in severe chronic urticaria refractory
to medical treatment.
