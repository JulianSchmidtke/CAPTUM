There are substantial knowledge gaps related to diagnosis and
management of pediatric cases of chronic urticaria, and in
particular chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). In this article we
aimed to review the diagnosis and management of chronic
urticaria in children and CSU in particular. We conducted a
systematic review of articles published in English and French on
pediatric CSU management in the last 10 years. We included
experimental studies (eg, randomized controlled trials), other
experimental designs (eg, nonrandomized methods of
assignment, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time
series), and observational studies (eg, prospective or
retrospective cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, case-control
studies, and case reports). Our findings highlight the efficacy of
second-generation antihistamines for the treatment of CSU in
children and supports the use of omalizumab for more severe
cases. However, our study also reveals severe knowledge gaps
related to the best management strategy in children with more
severe/refractory cases of CSU. Future studies are required to
establish the beneficial effect of high doses of second-generation
antihistamines as well as the effectiveness and safety of
omalizumab and other biologics in young children. © 2018

INTRODUCTION

Urticaria is characterized by the presence of itchy wheals,
angioedema, or both. Most cases in the pediatric age group are
acute and self-limiting. Chronic urticaria (CU), defined as
daily or almost daily disease activity for at least 6 weeks, is

uncommon in children.'* CU is subclassified as spontaneous
or inducible. The point prevalence of chronic spontaneous
urticaria (CSU) has been estimated at 0.5% to 1% for the
general population’ * and 0.1% to 0.3% for children’ but can
reach 1.2% in selected pediatric populations (eg, children with
systemic lupus erythematosus).° Most pediatric CU cases are
reported to be spontaneous (55.9% of cases).’ Recent studies
suggest that pediatric CU impairs quality of ife,° and has a
relatively low natural resolution rate (10% per year).’
Although guidelines cover the management of CU in
adults,”!°''" there are little data on the management of pediatric CU.

Given the impact and extensive knowledge gaps related to the
management of pediatric cases of CU, and in particular CSU, the
present article will focus mainly on the management of CSU. To
address the latter, one of the authors (M.B.-S.) conducted a
systematic review to assess the published evidence on the management of pediatric CSU. It is important to look at specific data
in children given potential differences between children and
adults regarding the pathogenesis, pharmacokinetics, and medication side effects.

 

 

ACUTE URTICARIA MANAGEMENT

The main cause of acute urticaria in children is viral
infections, mainly of the upper respiratory tract.'>'> Other
causes include food'* and drug hypersensitivity’ * (5.3% and 5%
of all cases of acute urticaria, respectively). The diagnosis of the
latter causes is established through corroboration of a suggestive
clinical history consistent with an immediate hypersensitivity
reaction occurring shortly (usually within minutes and certainly
no more than 1 hour after exposure) and the use of confirmatory
skin tests, specific IgE levels, and, potentially, provocation
challenges. It is important to confirm a diagnosis of allergy in
acute urticaria with confirmatory tests to avoid mislabeling of
patients as allergic.

Second-generation antihistamines are the main treatment for
nonanaphylactic episodes of acute urticaria. Studies have
established in the pediatric age group (children older than 1
year) the safe and effective use of cetirizine (1 year, 0.25 mg/kg
twice daily; 2-5 years, 2.5 mg twice daily; 6-11 years, 5 mg
twice daily; 12-17 years, 10 mg once daily),'° levocetirizine
(2-5 years, 1.25 mg twice daily; 6-17 years, 5 mg once daily),'°
fexofenadine (30 mg twice daily for children 6-12 years),'”
desloratadine (1.25 mg daily and 2.5 mg daily for children
1-5 years and 6-11 years, respectively), '* and loratadine (5 mg
daily for children 2-11 years, body weight up to 30 kg, 10 mg
daily above 30 kg). sa

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF ACUTE URTICARIA
IN CHILDREN

1. Anaphylaxis: Eighty percent of patients presenting with
anaphylaxis have urticarial rash as a feature. Prompt
epinephrine administration is indicated in all cases presenting
with urticaria as part of anaphylaxis (defined as at least 2 organ
systems involved or in cases of hypotension in response to a
known allergen).°°!

2. Serum sickness-like reaction (SSLR) is defined when large
erythematous urticarial plaques with dusky to ecchymotic
centers often associated with hand and foot swelling develop 7
to 21 days after medication exposure.

3. Viral infections can be associated rarely with a similar rash
called “urticaria multiforme” that resembles acute urticaria.”*
However, in cases of urticaria multiforme versus SSLR, rash
presents faster (1-3 days after an acute viral illness). Patients
with SSLR may have more pronounced extracutaneous
manifestations compared with those with urticaria multiforme, which may include fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgias, headaches, and a self-limited symmetric arthritis.°> Both are selflimited conditions with favorable long-term prognoses. For
unknown reasons, a hemorrhagic morphology within urticarial lesions is commonly seen in children (Figure 1).4
Children presenting with both forms can be managed with
antihistamines and/or antipyretics as needed. In more severe
cases of SSLR, oral steroids should be considered.*”

THE NATURAL HISTORY OF CU

CU in adults is considered a self-limited disease, yet it resolves
spontaneously within 5 years in only 30% to 55% of adult patients.”°°” However, data on the natural history of CU and its
subtypes in children are scarce. In a recent Canadian study it was
reported that the mean age at disease onset was 6.7 + 4.7 years
(range, 0-17 years). Similar to adult studies, the resolution rate
was low, 10.3 per 100 patients-years. The most common type of
CU was CSU (78%). Twenty-two percent of patients had
physical urticaria (PU); of these, approximately a quarter had
CSU as well. A quarter of patients had concomitant angioedema
symptoms.”

In previous studies in adults, it was reported that resolution is
less likely in females, cases of long duration of the disorder at the
initial examination, cases with angioedema, and PUs.*° Factors
affecting disease resolution in children included CD63 upregulation on basophil measured by the basophil activation test
(BAT) and absence of peripheral blood basophils. Interestingly,
these 2 parameters were previously biologically linked—basopenia was observed mainly in the autoimmune subset of CSU and
hypothesized to be a result of recruitment of circulating basophils

into the skin during disease activity.”’ Similar findings were reported in a study conducted on adults with CU, where 56.5% of
autoimmune CU cases resolved after 1.2 years (only 15 patients)
compared with 34.5% of idiopathic forms in 1 year.’>””

CU MANAGEMENT

CU is not considered an allergic condition even though histamine release from cutaneous mast cells is a primary pathogenic
event. Routine extensive blood work or skin tests are not indicated. A complete blood cell count and sedimentation rate/
C-reactive protein levels are often the only tests ordered"?
To monitor diseases activity it is recommended to record daily
wheal numbers and pruritus severity using a standardized urticaria activity score.*” Up to 40% of adults and children with
CSU are considered to have a type Ib autoimmune basis for
their disease.°” In these patients, it is hypothesized that autoantibodies induce mast cell (and basophil) degranulation.
Patients can be screened for the presence of these autoantibodies
either in vivo with the use of the autologous serum skin test or
in vitro with the basophil histamine release assay or the BAT
measuring CD63 or CD203 upregulation on healthy donor
basophils incubated with heterologous serum from the patient.”*”? Practical challenges in conducting the autologous skin
test favor the in vitro methods for the assessment of functional
autoantibodies. More recently it was reported that in children
with CSU the BAT reveals high CD63 expression on basophils
and that high levels (>1.8% of basophils) or absence of basophils
on complete blood cell counts was associated with earlier disease
resolution.”“” However, currently the use of BAT is limited to
research and is not offered in clinical practice routinely.

Although most CU cases in childhood are reported to be
spontaneous, it is important to rule out rare forms that may
require different treatment. These include the following:

 

 

1. Inducible urticarias
a. PU. It occurs when the CU is associated with a specific
physical stimulus (eg, cold contact urticaria, solar urticaria,
delayed pressure urticaria, heat contact urticaria,
1154 BEN-SHOSHAN AND GRATTAN

dermographic urticaria, or vibratory angioedema).*' It is
reported that PU can affect 22% of children presenting
with CU and that among all cases of PU a quarter will also
have CSU.’ The most common cause of PU (38% of all
cases) is dermographic urticaria.’? The prevalence of coldinduced PU may vary according to latitude,*! and it is
reported that in countries with lower temperatures during
winter, cold-induced PU accounts for 16% of pediatric PU
cases.” Up to 67% cases of PU were reported to have
associated angioedema’ and only 11.6% of children
become free of urticaria at 1 year postonset and 38.4% at 5
years postonset.** Establishing the diagnosis of PU is based
on physical provocation tests as previously published.*°“?

In general, nonsedating antihistamines should be given daily
but avoidance of the physical trigger and the use of secondgeneration H1 antihistamines to control symptoms before
anticipated exposure may be sufficient in some patients.
Recently, successful treatment with subcutaneous omalizumab
injections off-label has been reported for children with severe
PU, including cold-induced PU“ and delayed pressure urticaria,’” which often respond. poorly to antihistamines.*°

Because cold urticaria may be associated with systemic
symptoms and potential fatality with allover cold exposure (eg,
when swimming unsupervised in cold water), "” prescription of
an epinephrine autoinjector for children presenting with coldinduced PU could be considered for those deemed at risk,
especially in cases presenting with a history of systemic
reactions.

 

b. Cholinergic urticaria. Cholinergic urticaria affects 2.2% to
6.5% of children diagnosed with inducible CU.”*? It is
characterized by the development of pinpoint-sized wheals
and severe itch in conditions associated with elevated core
body temperature (eg, as exercise and hot showers).
Among children, cholinergic urticaria is most common in
teenagers*° and especially in those with atopy.”” Cholinergic urticaria is diagnosed through passive (warm bath) or
active (exercise) warming.“ Decreasing the degree of exercise and temperature exposure is obviously challenging in
small children as well as in teenagers who engage is sports
regularly. Antihistamines are first-line treatment, but are
often not effective. Recent reports in adults suggest that
omalizumab may lead to complete control of cholinergic
urticaria although symptoms recur once treatment is discontinued.’ No similar reports in children have been
published so far.

2. Other causes of CU

a. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)-associated urticaria. It has been recognized that almost a quarter
of children and adolescents with CSU are hypersensitive to
aspirin and can experience symptom aggravation when
exposed to aspirin and other NSAIDs.” This clinical
picture is known as aspirin-exacerbated cutaneous disease.
In other words, patients with CU are at increased risk of
exacerbations of urticaria that are temporally associated
with NSAID treatment. Alternatively, there are patients
without CU who will present solely with acute urticaria
after NSAID exposure. It is proposed that these conditions
are related to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 leading to

 

J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT
JULY/AUGUST 2018

a decreased synthesis of prostaglandin E2 and an increased
cysteinyl leukotriene production in the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Urticaria in these cases is managed through
the use of nonsedating antihistamines, avoidance of
nonselective cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitors, and the use of
alternative NSAIDs that do not inhibit cyclooxygenase-1
inhibitory activity for the relief of pain inflammation and
fever (use of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors is discouraged for
children younger than 16 years).”° Refractory cases are
reported to improve with omalizumab.™*
b. Parasite infections. Recent studies suggest that up to 10%
of CU cases in children in endemic areas may be related to
intestinal parasite infections,” mainly strongyloidiasis and
astocystosis (established through serology for strongyloidiasis and stool tests for Blastocystis hominis). In a recent
meta-analysis not limited to children it was reported that
35.7% of cases benefited from antiparasitic drugs.”°
Although studies report clear benefit for treatment of
strongyloidiasis, ” there is still debate regarding the need to
treat disease caused by Blastocystis hominis, which is
considered an opportunistic organism, associated with
nonspecific symptoms. * We suggest assessing for parasites
in children with recent travel to tropical countries (within
1 year of symptoms), with gastrointestinal symptoms (eg,
abdominal pain),” with high eosinophil count, or those
living in regions considered endemic for parasites (eg,
Northern Territory in Australia).°°
3. Urticarial rash associated with systemic disease

a. Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome is rare (1 per
million persons) but important to diagnose so correct
treatment can be offered. It includes 3 autoinflammatory
conditions, ranging in severity from mild (familial cold
autoinflammatory syndrome), moderate (Muckle-Wells
syndrome) to severe (neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disorder). Common presenting features included
urticaria (100%), periodic fever (78%), arthralgia (72%),
and sensorineural hearing loss (61%). In cases of MuckleWells syndrome, most will have a family member similarly
affected compared. The recommended treatment in these
cases is with anti—IL-1 therapy.°!

b. Urticaria associated with vasculitis. Although rare, CU may
be the first manifestation of juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus.°” Hence, rigorous follow-up in children and
adolescents with CU is required and investigation to rule
out a collagen disease is required in cases who develop
other characteristic symptoms, such as arthritis or autoimmune hematologic abnormalities.

RESEARCH METHOD—MANAGEMENT OF CSU IN
CHILDHOOD

The process consisted of conducting a systematic review of
studies that examined the management of CSU in children.
The review was conducted using the PubMed and EMBASE
databases of work published in English and in French in the
last 10 years (November 2007 to October 2017). We included
only studies in the pediatric age group using the following
keywords: “urticaria” AND “chronic.” We included experimental studies (eg, randomized controlled trials [RCT's]), other
experimental designs (eg, nonrandomized methods of

assignment, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted
time series), and observational studies (eg, prospective or
retrospective cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, casecontrol studies, and case reports). Per an agreed upon a
priori decision of the authors, opinion-based reports (ie,
editorials, letters, and nonsystematic or narrative reviews) were
excluded, as well as basic science or animal (nonhuman subject) studies.

DATA SYNTHESIS

The analysis involved summarizing the data, and presenting
results in a narrative synthesis. M.B.S. prepared descriptive tables
to give an overview of the included study characteristics. Because
this article was not designed as such, we did not intend to carry
out quantitative analysis, meta-analysis, or assess risk of bias.

RESULTS

The initial database search yielded 104 results, of which 15
articles are included in the final analysis (Figure 2, Table l). We
defined 3 major management strategies evaluated for the treatment of CSU in children:

1. H1 antihistamines
2. Omalizumab (anti-IgE)
3. Ciclosporin

All studies assessing antihistamines were designed as RCT.
The results indicate high efficacy and safety for levocetrizine,”’
rupatadine,”* desloratadine,°* and bilastine.°? In a head-tohead study comparing rupatadine and desloratadine, rupatadine had been shown to be superior regarding control of itchiness. However, an RCT comparing levocetrizine and rupatadine
reported more significant (P < .001) improvement in the levocetrizine group, although symptoms improved in both

66 Fi ee
groups. There were no studies comparing levocetrizine and

bilastine or rupatadine and bilastine in children.

Four RCTs demonstrated high efficacy and safety for the use
of omalizumab involving adults and teenagers in doses of 150 m
to 300 mg subcutaneously once a month for 6 months.'!°”
However, only a minority of the study population were teenagers and no children younger than 12 years were included. Case
reports support the efficacy and safety of omalizumab*””*”° and
ciclosporin (3-4 mg/kg/d)" in severe cases of CSU in teenagers as well as in younger children. There was 1 case report
demonstrating the benefit of rituximab use.”

DISCUSSION

Our review highlights the efficacy of second-generation antihistamines for the treatment of CSU in children and supports the
use of omalizumab for more severe cases. However, our study
also reveals severe knowledge gaps related to the best management strategy in children with more severe/refractory cases of
CSU. The absence of studies documenting the use of high doses
of second-generation antihistamines (up to 4 times the normal
dose) and large-scale RCTs establishing the effectiveness and
safety of omalizumab and other biologics in young children is
worrisome.

Second-generation H1 antihistamines, compared with their
first-generation counterparts, have demonstrated improved peripheral H1-receptor selectivity and decreased lipophilicity
(which minimizes central nervous system adverse effects). There
are limited studies on antihistamine response in pediatrics. There
are no studies reporting the percentage of children failing to
respond to standard doses. However, 2 studies reported percentage failure with high doses’'”*; one reported that 35% of
children failed to respond to double the dose of antihistamines 7°;
in the second study, it was reported that almost 13% failed
therapy with high- dose antihistamines even with the addition of
alternate morning prednisone. ’'

Effect

Previously, a pediatric pharmacokinetic study (protocol

established that a 10-mg dose of bilastine in children
aged 2-<12 y provided an equivalent systemic
exposure as a 20-mg dose in adults. Bilastine 10 mg
had a safety and tolerability profile similar to that of
placebo in children aged 2-<12 y

Absolute change in UAS7 at 42 d showed statistically
significant differences between active treatments and
placebo (—5.5 + 7.5 placebo, —11.8 +
8.7 rupatadine, and —10.6 + 9.6 desloratadine;

P < .001) and without differences between
antihistamine compounds. There was a 55.8%
decrease for rupatadine followed by desloratadine
(—48.4%) and placebo (—30.3%). Rupatadine but not
desloratadine was statistically superior to placebo in
reduction of pruritus (—57%)

The mean daily UAS decreased to 0.10 in the
levocetirizine group and to 0.38 in the rupatadine
group. Patients in the levocetirizine group showed a
more significant (P < .001) improvement, although
symptoms improved in both groups. Significant
reductions in mean DLQI scores were observed in
both groups, but the decrease was statistically
significant in the levocetirizine group (P < .05).

favor of omalizumab (75mg, P = .0010;

with —4.0 (95% CI, —5.3 to —2.7) in the placebo
group (P < .001)

The mean changes from baseline in weekly itch-severity

significantly improved in the group receiving 150 mg
of omalizumab (—8.1 + 6.4, P = .001) and 300 mg of

Agents currently authorized for use in children aged 2 to 11
years include cetirizine, desloratadine (age 1 year), levocetirizine,
loratadine, and rupatadine.”” Our current review suggests that
new antihistamines introduced may contribute to better control
of CSU. Rupatadine has affinity for histamine H1 receptors and
platelet-activating factor receptors. Platelet-activating factor is a
potent mediator involved in the hypersensitivity-type allergic
reaction, although the effect of rupatadine may be independent
of any action on platelet-activating factor.“° An advantage of
bilastine relates to its good safety profile. Bilastine is highly selective for the H1 histamine receptor, has a rapid onset, and has
prolonged duration of action. This agent does not interact with
the cytochrome P450 system and does not undergo significant
metabolism in humans, suggesting that it has very low potential
for drug-drug interactions, and does not require dose adjustment
in renal impairment. Bilastine showed similar efficacy to levocetirizine in adults with CSU.”

According to current European, Canadian, and World Health
Organization guidelines, the dose of second-generation antihistamines should be increased up to 4 times for a trial if the
standard dose is not effective.*“*”* Few studies in adults
demonstrated that adult patients with CU receiving up to 4 times
the dose have better control of symptoms”? and do not experience more side effects."° However, the efficacy of these dose
escalations was not established in children although they are
suggested to be applicable in children on the basis of extrapolated
data from rhinitis studies.*!

Studies suggest that in teenagers and adults, cetirizine use may
promote somnolence and decrease motivation to perform actiyities during the workday compared with loratadine even at recommended doses.***? Hence, we suggest using other secondgeneration antihistamines at higher than normal doses (eg,
desloratadine or bilastine in children 12 years and older). Future
studies establishing the safety of high-dose second-generation
antihistamines are crucial.

There are also substantial knowledge gaps regarding the
optimal dose and duration of omalizumab treatment. Although
studies report that 150 mg and 300 mg of omalizumab once
monthly for 6 months will effectively control most CSU
cases,°”* it is reported that longer duration and higher frequency of administration may benefit more resistant cases.“784°
Large-scale studies defining the optimal dose and duration of
treatment in the pediatric CSU are required to establish clear
management guidelines for omalizumab in children. Although
ciclosporin had been reported to be effective in limited sample
size studies in children,’ '”* potential toxicity that can occur in
more than half the patients treated with moderate doses (4-5 mg/
kg/d) and the need to monitor renal function and bloo levels*°
are significant limitations to the use of ciclosporin in children
with CU.

Given the poor adherence to current guidelines®’ and reports
on the frequent use of steroids in patients with CU,"* educational programs contributing to the implementation of current
guidelines and discouraging the use of steroids are required,
except as rescue treatment for acute severe flares.”” This is
especially important in young children given reports of behayioral abnormalities,” adrenal suppression, ”' and avascular
necrosis.”

The main limitations of this review relate to the absence of
large RCTs establishing the role of omalizumab and ciclosporin
in the pediatric age group. Owing to the limited available data,

we are unable to make any confident recommendations regarding
their use in children. However, the findings from case reports are
encouraging and suggest the urgent need for large, well-designed,
double-blind, and placebo-controlled randomized trials to
investigate the use of omalizumab in children with CSU,
including those younger than 12 years.
