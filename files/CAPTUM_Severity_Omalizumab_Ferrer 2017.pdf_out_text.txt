Expert opinion: defining response to omalizumab
in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria

Omalizumab (a recombinant, humanized anti-immunoglobulin-E antibody) has been shown in three pivotal Phase III trials (ASTERIA I, II
and GLACIAL) and real-world studies to be effective and well-tolerated
for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), and is the
only licensed third-line treatment for CSU. However, the definition of
response to omalizumab treatment often differs between clinical trials,
real-world studies, and daily practice of individual physicians globally.
As such, a consensus definition of “complete”, “partial” and “nonresponse” to omalizumab is required in order to harmonize treatment
management and compare data. Here, it is proposed that a disease measurement tool, for example, the 7-Day Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7)
or Urticaria Control Test (UCT) is required for defining response. The
addition of quality of life measurements is helpful to gain insight into
a patient’s disease burden and its changes during treatment. A potential
omalizumab treatment approach based on speed and pattern of response
at 1-3 and 3-6 months is suggested. In cases where there is no response
during the first 1-3 months, physicians should consider reassessing the
original CSU diagnosis. Moreover, in patients showing partial response
at 12 weeks, treatment with omalizumab should be continued in order
to maximize the possibility of achieving symptom control. If patients
have a UAS7>6 and/or UCT <12, then continued treatment is advised,
dependent on physician judgement and patient expectations. In treatment
responders, omalizumab treatment can be resumed at a later stage after
discontinuation with the same degree of symptom control.

by a central swelling of variable size, usually surrounded

ing [1]. As well as the clinical burden associated with the
signs and symptoms of hives and angioedema, CSU impacts
many other facets of patients’ daily lives. Indeed, factors
such as the unpredictability of attacks, social isolation, and
reduced sleep quality due to itching and associated fatigue
all contribute to a diminished quality of life (QoL) [2-4].
Moreover, CSU bears a socioeconomic burden due to direct
(medication, healthcare visits) and indirect (reduced work
productivity, increased work absenteeism) healthcare costs
(2, 5].

The EAACI/GA?LEN/EDF/WAO international urticaria
guidelines recommend second-generation Hj -antihistamines, at licensed doses, as first-line treatment for CSU, and
in those patients not responding to therapy, at up to four
times the licensed dose as second-line treatment [1]. However, licensed doses of Hj-antihistamines lead to absence
of symptoms in fewer than 50% of patients with CSU
[1, 2, 6-8], and up-dosing can increase the efficacy of H)antihistamines in some, but not all patients [6, 7, 9-12].
A recent systematic review and meta-analysis regarding
up-dosing of non-sedating antihistamines in patients with
CSU found the proportion who responded to antihistamine
up-dosing was 63.2%, with 38% of patients responding to
licensed doses. Moreover, the authors found that up-dosing
appears to lead to a significant improvement in the itch control component of CSU, but not the number of hives [12]. In
cases where patients do not respond adequately to increased
doses of H,-antihistamines, the international urticaria
guidelines recommend either omalizumab, ciclosporin, or
montelukast as third-line add-on treatment [1].
Omalizumab is a_ recombinant, humanized  antiimmunoglobulin (Ig)-E antibody, approved as add-on
therapy for the treatment of CSU in adults and adolescent
(12 years and above) patients with inadequate response
to Hj,-antihistamine treatment [13, 14]. Omalizumab is
the only licensed treatment for use as third-line therapy
or CSU. By binding to free IgE, omalizumab prevents
it from binding to high-affinity receptors (FceRI). This
ultimately reduces the signs and symptoms of urticaria
15]. Notably, it is likely that omalizumab achieves its
therapeutic effects through various different pathways
16, 17], and as such its mechanism of action in CSU has
yet to be fully elucidated. Approval of omalizumab as
third-line treatment for CSU was based on the results of
three Phase III, multicentre, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled studies, namely ASTERIA I, ASTERIA IL, and GLACIAL [18-20]. Together, these pivotal
trials demonstrated that omalizumab, at 300 mg, provided
significant and sustained improvement versus placebo
or the symptoms of CSU with an inadequate response
to Hj-antihistamine treatment. Omalizumab treatment
resulted in a significantly reduced weekly Itch Severity
Score (ISS) between baseline and Week 12 (ASTERIA I,
ASTERIA II and GLACIAL) and baseline and Week 24
(ASTERIA I and GLACIAL). Moreover, no new safety
concerns were raised with omalizumab in this patient
population relative to its known safety profile for allergic
asthma [15, 18-20].
The licensed dose of omalizumab is 300 mg in the EU and
either 150 or 300 mg in the US [13], by subcutaneous injection every four weeks. Some reports have shown examples
of the optimization of omalizumab treatment in patients
who show inadequate response by increasing the dose or
decreasing the dosing intervals [21, 22]. There is currently
no internationally agreed algorithm for the individualized
management of omalizumab treatment, although a Danish
algorithm was published in 2014, which was dependent on
the 7-Day Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) [23]. In addition, in patients who respond to omalizumab treatment, a
consensus is needed on when and how to stop omalizumab.
Moreover, there is no agreement on the definition of a nonresponder and when to admit this status and consider other
treatment options.

The Urticaria Activity Score (UAS) is a validated measure for assessing urticaria activity in patients with CSU
[24]. EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF/WAO international urticaria
guidelines recommend evaluation of disease activity and
response to treatment in routine clinical practice using the
UAS7 (the sum of the UAS over seven consecutive days)
[1]. However, differences exist with regard to how CSU
treatment response is measured and defined in both clinical
trials and real-world clinical practice [18, 20, 25-32]. This
lack of consensus on the definition of response to treatment
potentially impacts perceived treatment efficacy, as well as
patient satisfaction and subsequent compliance with therapy. Improved characterization of response to treatments
such as omalizumab may help healthcare providers to better
convey realistic expectations of the likelihood of a response
to treatment at different time points [33].

A meeting of 12 chronic urticaria expert physicians was
convened on 8" October 2015 in Copenhagen, Denmark,
with the following objectives: (1) to reach a consensus on
how response to treatment should be measured in clinical trials and real-world clinical practice; (2) to develop
definitions of response and non-response to treatment in
patients with CSU; and (3) to gain insight into the characteristics of responders and non-responders (or response
patterns) to omalizumab and the practical implications of
response and non-response, as well as different response
patterns. The aim of this article is to provide a summary
of key discussion points from the meeting regarding definitions of treatment response, modes of response/response
patterns, factors affecting response, and a potential omalizumab treatment approach based on response patterns.

Definitions of response

Given variations in the definition of response to treatment
in CSU among physicians globally, it was agreed that there
is a need for clarity regarding how “complete”, “partial”
and “non-response” are defined. It should be noted, however, that the differing expert definitions of response broadly
align on the same ultimate goal of complete control of
urticaria signs and symptoms as rapidly and as safely as possible. A disease measurement tool is required when defining
treatment response, supplemented by a patient-orientated
measure (including patient expectations and QoL, such
as the Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life questionnaire
[CU-Q20L] or Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI]).
Further, UAS7 should be assessed every week during omalizumab treatment. This is particularly important during the
first 12 weeks, when it would be possible to define a slow,
fast, or partial response pattern (figure 1). Once the responder profile is defined, we believe that the UAS7 should
be measured again the week before receiving omalizumab.
Likewise, the Angioedema Activity Score (AAS) should
be recorded for four consecutive weeks. This is important
since patients suffering from CSU could have days with
severe urticarial lesions, without swelling, and vice versa.

The UAS7 provides a validated composite of the ISS and
number of hives score over a period of seven days (score
ranges from 0 to 42), providing semi-quantitative information on disease activity between clinic visits [34]. A UAS7

of 0 indicates that the patient is itch- and hive-free, i.e. a
complete response. A UAS7<6 has been proposed to reflect
well-controlled disease. UAS7 ranging from 7-15, 16-27,
and 28-42 are proposed to indicate mild, moderate, and
severe disease activity, respectively. These cut-off values
appear to efficiently describe CSU health states with regards
to signs and symptoms of the disease [35]. However, across
studies employing the UAS7 tool, response to treatment
has been defined differently (table 1) [18, 20, 25-32]. Some
studies have defined treatment response as a UAS7 of 0, to
indicate absence of itch and hives [30], although this may
be difficult to achieve in real-life clinical practice and may
not make a clinical difference in terms of QoL compared
to a UAS7 of 1-6. Furthermore, individuals without CU
are likely to experience itch occasionally, therefore having
UAS7>0, but no urticaria. As such, a UAS7<6 is proposed
as a definition of CU treatment response.

The UAS7 does not include a component relating to
angioedema and it is thought that the rate of angioedema
may be under-reported in clinical trials. More than 50%
of patients with CSU have associated angioedema at baseline and the presence of angioedema has been shown to

EJD, vol. 27, n° 5, September-October 2017

impair QoL more than hives alone [36-39]. Omalizumab
has been shown to be effective in treating CSU with associated angioedema. For example, a subgroup analysis of the
Phase II] GLACIAL trial demonstrated that omalizumab
treatment was associated with a reduction in angioedema
compared with placebo [37]. Similarly, the X-ACT study in
CSU patients with frequent angioedema, who had an inadequate response to Hj-antihistamines at increased doses,
found that following omalizumab treatment, the number
of angioedema burdened days was 14.6 days compared
with 49.5 days in the placebo group [40]. Overall, therefore, a definition of treatment response that incorporates
angioedema would be useful.

The Urticaria Control Test (UCT) is a validated instrument
designed to assess the level of disease control in patients
with CU and thus aid treatment decisions [41, 42]. The test
comprises four questions around how much patients have
suffered from urticaria symptoms, how much symptoms
have affected quality of life, how often treatment was not
enough to control symptoms, and how well patients felt
their urticaria was under control, over the past four weeks.
The answer to each question is rated from 0 to 4, resulting

period, consider shortening the dosing intervals; (e) if partial response for 3-6 months, consider reassessing the diagnosis (if no
reassessment occurred at 1-3 months); (f) if complete response has been present for 3-6 months, consider tapering or discontinuing

in a total score ranging from 0 to 16. A UCT score of 0
indicates “no disease control”, a score of <11 indicates poor
disease control, and a score of > 12 points to well-controlled
CU. The highest possible score of 16 represents complete
disease control [41, 42]. It should also be noted that the UCT
score comprises pruritus, wheals, and/or angioedema.

The DLQI is a validated patient questionnaire for evaluating health-related QoL (HR-QoL) in patients with a variety
of skin conditions, including CSU. The DLQI consists of
10 questions across six domains: symptoms and feelings,
daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. Impact of CSU on each factor is scored
from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much) and scores are totalled
to give an overall DLQI score from 0-30. The minimum
index scoring, from 0 to 1, corresponds to no effect at all
on the patient’s life and the maximum, from 21 to 30, to an
extremely large effect on the patient’s life [43-45].

The validated CU-Q20L was specifically designed for
the assessment of HR-QoL in CU, including the physical, psychosocial, and practical aspects of this condition.
Twenty-three questions cover six key CSU-specific
domains: itch, swelling, impact on life activities, sleep problems, “looks”, and limits. The overall score ranges from
0-100 with a higher score indicating greater impairment in
HR-QoL [46].

In addition to using validated instruments, many physicians
will base their definitions of treatment response on prior
experience and clinical judgement. Some physicians may
augment this by using real-life-orientated measures, such as
the Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA). Ina recent retrospective analysis that evaluated the outcome of omalizumab
treatment in 154 patients with CU, treatment response was
graded according to a modified PGA, whereby complete or
almost complete response corresponded to >90% reduction
in symptoms, partial response to a reduction of between
30% and 89%, and no or limited response to a reduction of
<30% [47].

 

EJD, vol. 27, n° 5, September-October 2017

We believe it would be valuable to conduct a responder
analysis that separates response defined by ISS and number of hives (the individual components of UAS7), UAS7,
and a QoL index, such as CU-Q20L or DLQI, in order to
better define treatment response in patients with CSU. A
similar analysis for the four items of the UCT would also
be helpful in this regard. Furthermore, since the presence
of angioedema is often under-reported in clinical trials, it
would be worth considering the addition of one line to the
UAS7 to report the occurrence of angioedema. This could
be a score of 0 (no angioedema in the previous 24 hours)
or 1 (patient experienced angioedema in the previous 24
hours) that would be considered in addition to the patient’s
total UAS7. Such an approach would of course require
further study for the purposes of validation. Alternatively,
AAS should be used as a validated measure of angioedema
activity [48].

Modes of response/response patterns

A recent publication provided more insights into data from
the three pivotal clinical trials of omalizumab in 975 patients
with CSU [33]. Patients were randomized to either placebo
or omalizumab (75, 150 or 300 mg in ASTERIA I [n = 318;
24 weeks] and ASTERIA II [n = 322; 12 weeks]), or 300 mg
in GLACIAL [n = 335; 24 weeks). Response was defined as
well-controlled urticaria (UAS7<6) or complete response
(UAS7 = 0). Results of the analysis showed that omalizumab at 300 mg over six months was associated with
the highest response rates (both well-controlled and complete) (figure 2). Additionally, median times to achieve
well-controlled urticaria with omalizumab at 300 mg were
three weeks in ASTERIA II and six weeks in ASTERIA I
and GLACIAL, compared with seven weeks in ASTERIA

wee 459

 
 

ILand 11 weeks in ASTERIA I with omalizumab at 150 mg
[33].

The authors of the analysis suggested that the timing of
attaining well-controlled urticaria or a complete response
indicated there were potentially two categories of responder
to omalizumab, i.e. “fast responders” (within Weeks 4-6)
and those who required more than three doses to respond
(“slow responders’’). The finding that some patients with
CSU responded to omalizumab treatment early while others
took longer to achieve a response (Weeks 12-16) suggests
that stopping treatment before three months may be too
early and potentially misses an opportunity to control CSU
symptoms in those patients who take longer to respond [33].
In the real-world setting, similar response rates with omalizumab treatment are observed across studies despite
differences in definitions of response (table 1). Furthermore, the response rates achieved in these real-world studies
are generally better than those seen in clinical trials.

Factors affecting response

The ability to predict response to omalizumab treatment for
CSU would be highly beneficial since this would aid treatment decisions in clinical practice. In a recent retrospective
study, a number of factors were found to be associated
with an improved response to omalizumab [47]. Notably,
CSU was associated with a higher proportion of complete or almost complete responders compared with chronic
inducible urticaria, as assessed by PGA grading (67.4% vs
52.9%, respectively). Furthermore, among the patients with
CSU, a greater proportion of complete/almost complete
responders: had a negative histamine release test (77.3%
vs 27.3%; odds ratio [OR]: 9.07; p<0.001); did not have
angioedema (72.3% vs 56.1%; OR: 2.05; p = 0.066); and
had no prior history of treatment with systemic immunosuppressants (71.4% vs 56.8%; OR: 1.91; p =0.105). Moreover,
there was a tendency for improved treatment response with
older age at onset and a shorter disease duration [47].
With regards to a potential biomarker for predicting patient
response to omalizumab treatment, a lack of basophil
CD203c-upregulating activity in the serum of patients with
CU has been found to correlate with clinical response to
omalizumab [49]. In a retrospective study of 41 patients
with CU with inadequate response to H,-antihistamines,
CD203c-upregulating activity was present in 18 patients.
Of these, nine patients (50%) demonstrated improvement
with omalizumab treatment. In the 23 patients with no
CD203c-upregulating activity, 20 (87%) had a response to
omalizumab treatment [49]. Recently, Gericke et al. [50]
found that basophil histamine release induced by CSU sera
seems to correlate with a slow response to omalizumab, and
may represent a future biomarker. Although this remains
to be confirmed in larger, prospective studies, a lack of
basophil CD203c-upregulating activity may be a clinically
useful biomarker of response to omalizumab treatment in
patients with CU. At present, there is insufficient evidence
regarding which biomarkers may be predictive of response
to omalizumab treatment.

According to Metz et al., the majority of patients with
CSU showing a complete response to omalizumab treatment suffer a relapse (reoccurrence of symptoms) within
2-8 weeks of receiving their last omalizumab injection

460

[51]. In this retrospective analysis, there was evidence that
re-treatment with omalizumab is effective in this patient
population [51]. Overall, 100% (n = 25) of patients achieved
a complete response, defined as >90% improvement in
UAS7, to omalizumab retreatment (doses ranged from 150
to 600 mg/month, in 2- to 4-week intervals). This finding
is important because relapse following treatment discontinuation was seen in the Phase III clinical trials and
commonly occurs in real-world clinical practice. Similar
results regarding response to omalizumab re-treatment have
been observed by Labrador-Horrillo and colleagues [31]
and by Ghazanfar and colleagues [47]. Any algorithm for
the management of omalizumab treatment would have to
take relapse and re-treatment into account.

Assessing non-response/recommended
treatment algorithm

In our opinion, patients should be treated for at least six
months, before concluding that they are a non-responder to
omalizumab treatment. As noted in the analysis by Kaplan
et al., timing of response to omalizumab may vary, with
some patients being fast responders (within 4-6 weeks) and
others taking longer to start to respond (Weeks 12-16) [33].
Based on these observations, it would seem reasonable to
suggest that treatment with omalizumab at 300 mg should
be continued in patients showing limited response at 12
weeks in order to maximize the possibility of achieving
symptom control.

A complete response could be achieved in patients with
CSU who are partial responders to third-line omalizumab
by individualizing the treatment regimen, e.g. increasing
the dose of omalizumab or reducing the dosing interval. In
this regard, different treatment regimens may be required
for the different types of omalizumab responder, i.e. fast,
slow, or any other responder subgroups identified. Our proposed potential approach for omalizumab management for
complete, partial and non-responders to treatment is shown
in figure 2.

Prior to starting omalizumab treatment, it is important
to exclude certain differential diagnoses of CSU, for
example urticarial vasculitis and urticarial eruptions in autoinflammatory syndromes. This should be completed as part
of the guideline-recommended diagnostic algorithm [1].
During the first 1-3 months of treatment with omalizumab,
we believe that it is important to define the response profile
of the patient. In cases where there is no response during
the first 1-3 months, physicians should consider reassessing the original diagnosis before attempting up-dosing or
continuing treatment with omalizumab. If a primary diagnosis of CSU is confirmed, omalizumab treatment should
be continued at the same or higher dose as judged by the
individual clinician, in line with patient expectations, and
according to local guidelines. Where a partial response to
treatment is seen, physicians should first ensure that the
patient has not stopped taking his/her Hy-antihistamine
treatment (occasionally, in our experience following initiation of omalizumab, when patients start to see a response
they may decide that they no longer need to take antihistamines in addition to omalizumab). Following this,
physicians should consider optimizing the omalizumab

dose or dosing intervals, or both. Patients’ variation in
response between doses should also be taken into account.
For example, some patients may experience a relapse of
CSU symptoms towards the end of the four weeks between
omalizumab doses. In this patient population, it may be
useful to consider shortening omalizumab dosing intervals.
After 3-6 months of treatment, in cases where a partial
response is seen, physicians should consider reassessing
the diagnosis (if the diagnosis has not previously been
reassessed). As before, if a primary diagnosis of CSU is
confirmed, omalizumab treatment should be continued and
the individual clinician should judge whether to increase
the dose. If a complete response has been present for 3-6
months, we advise physicians to consider reducing the
dose of omalizumab and/or increasing the dosing intervals,
or discontinuing omalizumab to assess for spontaneous
remission. Results from the ongoing Phase II] OPTIMA
(Efficacy of Optimized Re-treatment and Step-up Therapy
With Omalizumab in CSU Patients) study are expected to
clarify optimal omalizumab dose [52].

If there is no response to omalizumab after six months of
treatment, we would advise considering the patient to be a
non-responder, discontinuing omalizumab and considering
an alternative treatment option.

In treatment responders, omalizumab treatment can be
resumed at a later stage after discontinuation with the same
degree of symptom control [51]. A clear algorithm for when
to restart treatment is needed. If patients have a UAS7>6
and/or UCT <12 (indicating active disease and/or poor disease control) during follow-up, then continued treatment
is advised. This is also dependent on physician judgement
and the patient’s own expectations. For example, depending on their previous disease activity, some patients may be
content to live with moderate CSU and their physician may
propose to restart treatment when their UAS7 is >16. The
presence or absence of angioedema should also be considered, as described previously when evaluating response and
managing treatment.

Key areas for future research

Clinical trials and real-world studies that support the efficacy and safety of omalizumab treatment in patients with
CSU with an inadequate response to H,-antihistamines
continue to accumulate. Nevertheless, many important
questions regarding the use of omalizumab remain to be
answered in order to optimize treatment management and
patient outcomes.

In particular, further investigations into predictors of good
outcome, optimal dose, and dosing intervals based on treatmentresponse to omalizumab in CSU are needed. We define
outcome as an objective treatment effectiveness measurement. There is also an urgent need to clarify the options on
how to treat non-responders. In addition, further studies
to determine the optimal duration of therapy and longterm treatment effects, in terms of efficacy and remission
rates and the safety/tolerability profile of omalizumab, are
required, as well as studies to determine the best strategy
for discontinuing omalizumab. Finally, it is important to
harmonize patient/physician evaluation and definition of
treatment response globally, across countries, for improved
comparison of real-world data.
