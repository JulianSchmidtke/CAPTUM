KEYWORDS Abstract Backgrounds: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common skin disorder charUrticaria: acterized by itchy wheals of at least 6 weeks in duration, wherein the autoimmune mechanism
Chronic; , is involved to activate IgE receptors (FceRla) on mast cells. We aimed to assess levels of IgG
IgE receptor; autoantibody against FceRla in sera from CSU patients using dot-blot immunoassay.

Autoimmunity Methods: We performed a hospital-based cross-sectional study of 125 CSU patients (64 ASST
Positive, 61 ASST-negative) and 64 age-and sex-matched healthy controls. The cut-off value
of IgG FceRla autoantibody was determined as the mean intensity plus two standard deviations
of values in controls. Positivity for IgG autoantibody to FceRla was analyzed according to clinical parameters of disease duration, urticaria activity score (UAS), ASST, response to antihistamine treatment, complement levels, and the presence of other autoantibodies.
Nonparametric tests were applied for statistical analyses.

Results: |gG positivity to FceRla was noted in 24.8% of CSU patients and was significantly more
frequent in ASST-positive patients than in ASST-negative patients (32.8% vs 16.4%, P = 0.040).
Only 3.1% of healthy controls had this autoantibody. Complement 3 levels were significantly
lower in anti-FceRla antibody-positive patients than antibody-negative patients
(109.8 + 19.9 vs 123.1 + 30.9, P = 0.035). No significant associations were found between
IgG positivity to FceRla and UAS, serum total IgE levels, atopic status, clinical responses to antihistamines, or the presence of anti-thyroid and anti-nuclear antibodies.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is defined as having
wheals and/or angioedema for more than 6 weeks, with
symptoms present almost daily, in individuals with no definite extrinsic causes.’ Studies have indicated that CSU
patients have specific factors in their blood that elicit urticarial wheals upon intradermal injections and the release
of histamine from basophils in vitro.” Previous  investigators have also reported that several autoimmune
diseases, including thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis,
type | diabetes mellitus, Sjorgen syndrome, Celiac disease,
and systemic lupus erythematosus, are related to the
prevalence of CSU.* An autoimmune background for CSU is
supported by the observation of immediate wheals and
flare responses after an autologous skin serum test (ASST) in
CSU patients.” Since Hide et al. identified IgG against the «
subunit of Fc receptor (FceRl«) for the first time in the sera
from CSU patients,’ other studies have also confirmed that
CSU patients have circulating FceRla or IgE antibody,° ®
which can induce degranulation of basophils and mast cells.
Various methodologies are used to measure autoantibodies, including histamine release from donor
basophils,*'’ ° autologous skin serum test,*''° immunoblotting with purified IgG,”’°''° and ELISA.'''? Binding assays for
FceRla have not proven useful as routine clinical assays,
because of a low specificity and time-consuming nature. Ina
recent study, '° however, a rapid dot-blot immunoassay was
developed to detect autoantibody against FceRla with high
specificity. Accordingly, we attempted to evaluate serum
levels of IgG autoantibody against FceRla in CSU patients
using dot-blot immunoassay and to investigate associations
with disease severity and other clinical parameters,
including ASST, urticaria activity score (UAS), responses to
treatment, and the presence of other auto-antibodies.

Materials and methods

Clinical characteristics of the study subjects

We enrolled 64 healthy controls and 125 CSU patients who
had urticaria symptoms for at least 6 weeks. CSU disease
activity was assessed using UAS, which evaluates wheal
characteristics, pruritus status, and symptom duration.
Total scores ranged from 0 to 15, with higher scores indicating higher disease activity.'* Refractoriness to antihistamines was defined as patients with persistent symptoms,
even after increasing antihistamine doses up to 4-fold.
Medication scores were calculated for systemic steroids and
antihistamines for the first 3 months of treatment. Steroid

and antihistamines uses were represented as equivalent
doses of prednisolone (mg/week) and loratadine (mg/day),
respectively.

Autologous serum skin test and atopy

Antihistamines were withdrawn for at least 5 days before
collecting autologous sera. ASST was performed according
to European guidelines.’ We defined a positive result as a
wheal induced at 30 min after an intradermal injection of
50 ul of autologous serum that was 1.5 mm larger than a
wheal induced by an injection of the same volume of saline.
Atopy was defined as positivity to at least one or more allergens on a skin prick test with common inhalant allergens.

Rapid dot-blot immunoassay for detecting IgG to
FceRla

To measure IgG to FceRla in sera from CSU patients and
healthy controls, we performed immunoblot assay as
described previously.'® Extracellular fragments of FceRlo.
protein (30 pg/ml in PBS) were dotted onto nitrocellulose
membranes and air dried. The membranes were then blocked
with 0.15% casein in PBS for 10 min and washed. After
washing, diluted (1:4 casein) patient serum was added and
incubated for 10 min. Bound IgG was detected using peroxidase conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Zymed, CA, USA). The
reaction was developed using a chemiluminescent substrate
solution (Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA, USA), and signals
were recorded by exposure to X-ray film. Quantitative analysis of the spots was conducted with a video densitometer
using Kodak analyzer software. A cut-off value for IgG to
FceRla positivity was determined as the mean value plus two
standard deviations in healthy controls.

Measurement of other antibodies and complement

Serum total IgE levels were measured by the ImmunoCAP
system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Anti-thyroid
autoantibodies, such as anti-thyroglobulin and thyroid
microsomal antibodies, were detected by radioimmunoassay (BRAHMS Aktiengesellschaft, Hennigsdorf, Germany).
Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) was detected using HEp-2 cells
and an indirect fluorescent antibody technique (Fluoro
HEPANA test; Medical & Biological Laboratories, Nagoya,
Japan). Complements 3 (90—180 mg/dl) and 4 (9-37 mg/dl)
were measured quantitatively using an immunoturbidimetric assay (Roche Hitachi Cobas C system, Rotkreuz,
Switzerland).

Statistical analysis

Mann—Whitney U-test was used for between-group comparisons of continuous variables. Categorical variables were
compared using Fisher’s exact test. Spearman’s rho test
was applied for correlation analysis. Statistical analyses
were performed using IBM SPSS version 20 for Windows
(SPSS Inc.,Chicago, IL, USA). P-values <0.05 were considered indicative of statistical significance.

Ethics statement

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
of Ajou University Hospital (AJIRB-BMR-KSP-15-134).

Results

Clinical characteristic of the study subjects

There were no significant differences in mean age, sex, and
atopy rate between CSU patients and controls (Table 1). To
compare the prevalence of IgG to FceRla according to ASST
results, we enrolled 64 ASST-positive and 61 ASST-negative
patients in the present study. Of 125 CSU patients, 47
(37.6%) were identified as having refractory urticaria (Table
1). Median urticaria duration in CSU patients was 4.5
months, and 33.6% of CSU patients had an angioedema. The
prevalences of ANA and anti-thyroid antibodies in CSU patients were 20.8% and 24.8%, respectively (Table 1).

Prevalence of IgG to FceRla in patients with CSU

To detect IgG to FceRla, a rapid immunodot assay was
performed in sera from 125 patients with CSU and 64
healthy controls. We noted a significant correlation between human IgG concentration and intensity levels of
standard spots (R* = 0.9542, P = 0.003). The mean

intensity of dot signals in the sera from CSU patients was
significantly greater than that in sera from NCs
(167.9 + 102.4 vs. 109.0 + 45.5, P < 0.001, Fig. 1). The
positive cutoff value for IgG to FceRla was determined as
200, which was equal to the mean plus two standard deviations of the intensity values of the serum samples from
the 64 healthy subjects. The prevalence of IgG to FceRla
was 24.8% in CSU patients, whereas just two (3.1%) of the
64 healthy controls had positive results on IgG to FceRla
(P < 0.001, Fig. 2).The mean dot signal intensity was
significantly higher in female patients with CSU than that in
male patients (181.7 + 111.7 vs. 129.5 + 55.7, P = 0.006).
However, no significant differences in levels of IgG to
FceRla by sex were observed in NCs (111.6 + 41.1 in 40
female controls vs. 106.0 + 52.9 in 24 males, P = 0.441).
Female sex (odds ratio 6.73, 95% confidence interval
1.43—31.67, P = 0.016) and a positive ASST response (2.53,
1.03—6.23, 0.043) were noted as key determinants of the
presence of IgG to FceRla in CSU patients in logistic
regression analysis (Table 3).

Association of IgG to FceRla with other clinical
parameters in patients with CSU

Positivity rates for IgG autoantibody to FceRla were significantly higher in ASST-positive CSU patients than in ASSTnegative CSU patients (32.8% vs. 16.4%, P = 0.034, Fig. 2
and Table 2). Sex was found to be an important factor
associated with positivity for IgG to FceRla, which was
noted in 2 (6.1%) of 33 male versus 29 (31.5%) of 92 female
patients with CSU (P = 0.004). Additionally, female prePonderance was marked in patients with positive IgG to
FceRla (93.5%), compared to IgG to FceRla-negative patients (67.0%, P = 0.004, Table 2). However, there were no

significant differences in mean values of age, serum total
IgE levels, urticaria duration, and UAS between IgG to
FceRla-positive and FceRla—negative groups. The presence
of angioedema (41.9% vs. 30.9%), ANA (29.0% vs. 18.3%),
and anti-thyroid antibodies (35.5% vs. 21.3%) tended to be
higher in patients with IgG autoantibody to FceRla,
compared to those without IgG to FceRla, although statistical significance was lacking (Table 2). Meanwhile, however, complement 3 levels were significantly lower in CSU
patients positive for anti-FceRla antibody than those with
negative results on IgG to FceRla (109.8 + 20.6 vs.
123.1 + 30.9, P = 0.035, Table 2). Complement 3 levels

were also significantly lower in ASST-positive patients than
in ASST-negative patients (113.1 + 25.7 vs. 126.5 + 31.0,

different between IgG to FceRla positive and negative patients (41.9% vs. 36.2%, P = 0.670, Table 2). There were no
significant differences in mean medication scores for steroid and antihistamines according to positivity of IgG to

Discussion

Studies have indicated that 30—60% of patients with CSU
has an autoimmune etiology on the basis of various laboratory and clinical evidence.2 7'°'*:'°-'” The prevalence
of thyroid autoimmunity in patients with CU was previously
reported as 12—30%.'°''” In our study, 31 (24.8%) of 125 CSU
patients exhibited a positive response to one or both of the
anti-thyroglobulin and anti-microsomal antibodies. Similar
to previous studies,'’ the frequency of anti-thyroid antibodies was found to be significantly higher in females
(31.5%), compared to 6.1% in males. Positive associations
between the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies and positivity to functional autoantibodies and ASST in CU patients
has been reported. '®’'® However, no significant differences
in the frequency of ATA according to ASST results and IgG to
FceRla were observed in the present study. In agreement
therewith, Mozena et al. demonstrated that an equivalent
Proportion of CU patients with and without thyroid autoimmunity had a positive ASST and anti-FceRlo antibodies. '
Moreover, they demonstrated that both the detection of
anti-FceRla antibodies and mast cell activation were not
affected by the addition of thyroid proteins. '° Accordingly,
we suggest that higher prevalences of anti-thyroid antibodies and IgG to FceRla in CSU patients indicate a common
genetic predisposition concordant among different autoimmune diseases. Similarly, a strong association between
HLA-DR4 and histamine-releasing functional antibodies has
been reported not only in CU but also in other autoimmune
diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, vitiligo, and pernicious anemia.”°

Anti-FceRla antibody was found in 24.8% of CSU patients
in the present study, while it was detected in 3.1% of NCs.
Furthermore, in patients with a positive ASST, the prevalence of IgG to FceRla was 32.8%, which was significantly
higher than that in ASST-negative patients (16.4%). Previous
studies reported various prevalences of anti-FceRla antibodies in CSU patients; in general, it was reported up to 50%

in CSU patients. In a recent study that sought to compare
the sensitivities and specificities of ELISA and immunodot
assay for detecting anti-FceRla autoantibodies in 20 ASSTPositive CSU patients, ELISA had 70% sensitivity and 82.5%
specificity, while immunodot showed 55% sensitivity and
100% specificity.'> We used the same immunodot method,
though the positive rate of IgG to FceRla was significantly
higher in patients with a positive ASST, although it was
relatively lower than what has previously been reported
(32.8% vs. 55%).'> Notwithstanding, the larger number of
study subjects in the present study, an ethnic difference, a
variety of urticaria durations, and other clinical characteristics might be possible causes of this apparent
discrepancy.

Fiebiger et al. demonstrated that 37% of CSU patients
show IgG autoantibody against immobilized soluble FceRla
in their sera using Western blot and that 60% of these sera
are functionally active.’ In another previous study that
performed the same immunoblotting assay, 64% of 53 sera
from CU patients showed a positive response to recombinant FceRIa.”' However, sera from some patients with
negative results on immunoblotting were found to release
histamine from basophils or cutaneous mast cells.”7' In
addition, there was also a subset of patients with positive
autoantibodies against IgE receptor or IgE itself who
showed no response to basophil histamine releasing test.*'
Although we did not confirm the functional activity of IgG to
FceRla, because no associations with the duration and
severity of urticaria or with clinical responses to antihistamines were observed, we could not definitively confirm
whether IgG to FceRla is genuinely pathogenic. Nonetheess, a recent study identified autoreactive CD4+ T-cells
targeting FceRla in 27% of CSU patients, while autoantibodies to FceRla were detected in 47%.” However, the
authors found no association between T-cell responses to
FceRlo, and medication use.”

On the clinical implications of the presence of autoantibodies and ASST responses in CSU patients, the evidence
is conflicting. Sabroe et al. reported that CU patients
determined as having functional autoantibodies on the
basis of basophil histamine releasibility show more and a
wider distribution of wheals.*> However, another study
reported no significant difference in the use of prednisoone and cyclosporine in CU patients according to the
Presence of anti-thyroid antibodies and serum-evoked
basophil activation.'’ With respect to ASST results,
several studies have shown significant associations between ASST positivity and urticaria severity or duration,*“° whereas a prospective study revealed that ASST
positivity was a significant predictor of CU control.'* A
recent systematic review also indicated no supportive evidence on an association between ASST positivity and urticaria duration.2° Considering these heterogeneous
results, we speculate that, in at least a third of patients
with CSU, autoantibodies against FceRla can activate and
degranulate mediators from basophils and mast cells;
however, there may be subsets of CSU patients who have
other circulating triggers to activate basophils and/or mast
cells regardless of autoimmunity'*’”7° or who have functionally inactive autoantibodies.”'

In addition to a female predominance in the prevalence
of IgG to FceRla, a significant decrease in complement 3

 
146

B. Ulambayar et al.

 

levels was also found in CSU patients with autoantibodies to
FceRla, as commonly observed in other autoimmune diseases. '*7°:2? Complement 3 has been reported to have a
synergic effect on IgG-mediated degranulation of mast
cells.°° While similar incidences of IgG to FceRla have been
recorded for other autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes
mellitus (36%), systemic lupus erythematosus (20%), and
pemphigus vulgaris (39%), only sera from CSU patients with
IgG to FceRla has been found to show histamine-releasing
activity and complementation activation. ''

The anti-IgE monoclonal antibody (omalizumab) treatment has been shown to be effective in antihistamine
resistant chronic autoimmune urticaria.*’ Based on the
mechanism of anti-lgE treatment is due to the reduction of
free IgE levels and decreased FceRla expression on peripheral basophils and skin mast cells,*”"** time to response
to omalizumab treatment was evaluated in a previous
study.** While the positivity in basophil histamine release
assay and ASST were significantly associated with a slow
response to omalizumab, however, the presence of IgG to
FceRla was noted in 11.4% of all complete responders and it
was not correlated with the time to urticaria remission with
omalizumab.** Although small numbers of the study subjects had omalizumab treatment in the present study, there
was no significant difference between the positivity of IgG
to FceRla and the response rate or time to response to
omalizumab. Therefore, further prospective studies are
needed to evaluate whether IgG to FceRla can be a potential biomarker to predict therapeutic outcomes of antiIgE treatment in CSU.

Taken together, we stress that further identification of
autoimmune markers will help with understanding the
pathogenic mechanisms of CSU. Furthermore, while the
pathogenic relevance of circulating autoantibodies has
been established, their clinical relevance against IgE receptors and IgE in CSU patients still remains to be
elucidated.

In conclusion, we identified circulating IgG to FceRla in
24.8% of CSU patients, including 32.8% of ASST-positive
patients. Our results reinforced findings from previous
studies, particularly a female dominance and a higher
prevalence in patients with positive ASST. Decreased C3
levels in patients with positive IgG to FceRla may be
possibly associated with complement activation involved in
autoimmunity in CSU. Further studies incorporating standardized measurements of autoantibodies and objective
outcome measures on a larger study population could help
with determining the exact clinical relevance of IgG to
FceRla in patients with CSU.
