Abstract

Background: Autoimmune chronic spontaneous urticaria (aiCSU) is an important
subtype of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in which functional IgG
autoantibodies to IgE or its high affinity receptor (FceRI) induce mast cell
degranulation and subsequent symptom development. However, it has not been
tightly characterized. This study aimed to better define the clinical and immunological

features and to explore potential biomarkers of aiCSU.

Methods: This was a multinational, multicenter study of 182 CSU patients. The
clinical features studied included: urticaria activity and impact (UAS7 and quality of
life); autologous serum skin test (ASST); IgG-anti-FceRI and IgG-anti-IgE; |gG-antithyroperoxidase (IgG-anti-TPO); total serum IgE; and basophil reactivity (BASO)
using the basophil activation test (BAT) and basophil histamine release assay

(BHRA).

Results: Of the 182 patients, 107 (569%) were ASST+, 46 (25%) were BASO+ and
105 (58%) were IgG-anti-FceRI+/lgE+. Fifteen patients (8%) fulfilled all three criteria
of aiCSU. aiCSU patients appeared more severe (UAS7 21 vs 9 P < 0.016) but
showed no other clinical or demographic differences from non-aiCSU patients.
aiCSU patients also had markedly lower total IgE levels (P<0.0001) and higher IgGanti-TPO levels (P<0.001). Of biomarkers, positive BAT and BHRA tests were 69%

and 88% predictive of aiCSU, respectively.

Conclusions: aiCSU is a relatively small but immunologically distinct subtype of
CSU that cannot be identified by routine clinical parameters. Inclusion of BHRA or
BAT in the diagnostic work up of CSU patients may aid identification of aiCSU

patients, who may have a different prognosis and benefit from specific management.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is defined by the EAACI/GA?LEN/EDF/WAO
guideline for the definition, classification, diagnosis and management of urticaria (1)
as the spontaneous appearance of wheals, angioedema, or both for > 6 weeks.

However, the underlying basic pathomechanisms of CSU are still largely unclear.

This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
The first suggestion that CSU may have an autoimmune basis came from Rorsman
in 1962 (2), who suggested an antigen-antibody reaction as a potential cause of the
observed peripheral blood basopenia. It has subsequently been proposed that this

autoimmunity may have two possible forms, Type | and Type IIb (3-6).

A possible role of IgE-mediated Type | autoimmunity, also referred to as autoallergy,
was postulated following observations of IgE autoantibodies to thyroperoxidase (7).
More recently, CSU patients have also been shown to have IgE against double
stranded DNA (8), interleukin-24 (9), tissue factor, and thyroglobulin (10). This is
supported by the high rate of CSU patients with elevated IgE levels (11) and the fast
onset of the beneficial effects of omalizumab (anti-IgE) in many CSU patients (12
16).

The hypothesis for Type IIb autoimmunity in CSU was initiated by reports that
autologous sera injected intradermally produced a wheal at the site of injection (17).
This is the autologous serum skin test (ASST) (1, 6). Subsequent studies showed
that IgG antibodies to the patient’s own IgE or its high affinity receptor (FceRI) were
instrumental in causing basophil and mast cell degranulation in vitro and are
believed to be directly relevant to urticaria pathogenesis (3, 18-21). This response

has been reviewed in detail recently (5, 22-24)

Autoimmune chronic spontaneous urticaria (aiCSU) is defined here by the presence
of functional and relevant mast cell-degranulating IgG autoantibodies to IgE or its
high affinity receptor Fc RI (6). The diagnostic criteria of aiCSU are 1) positive in

vivo autoreactivity (a positive ASST) as evidence of serum factors capable of an

inflammatory wheal response; 2) positive in vitro basophil reactivity (BASO+) (by
basophil histamine release assay (BHRA) or basophil activation test (BAT)) as
evidence of serum factors causing histamine release, basophil activation or both;
and, 3) a positive immunoassay for specific identification of IgG autoantibodies
against Fe RI and/or anti-IgE (western blot or ELISA) (6). As of now, these criteria
have not been applied together to define a specific subgroup of autoimmune CSU.
Consequently, the clinical features and potential biomarkers of aiCSU remain

unknown.

The aim of the international, prospective Profiling Urticaria for the Identification of
Subtypes (PURIST) study was to better define and characterize features of
“autoimmune” CSU that could be used in routine clinical practice to define the illness.
PURIST was designed, funded, implemented and performed by a global consortium
of urticaria centers of excellence, most of which are now UCARE centers (25). Here,
we present the first results of the PURIST study with a focus on the demographic,

clinical, and immunological profile of aiCSU and possible predictors.

Methods

Patients

A total of 182 chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) patients (134 female, median age
44 years, range 18 to 76 years) from 12 collaborating centres were recruited into the
study. Because we wanted a predominantly ASST+ population, the number of
ASST- patients who were recruited was no more than 75 patients, determined by a
power calculation of the likely number of CSU patients with evidence of autoimmune

urticaria based on literature available at the time. Ethics approval was obtained in

each of the cooperating centres and the study followed Good Clinical Practice
guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. All volunteers gave signed informed
consent to be included in the study. Exclusion criteria included individuals less than
18 years of age, pregnant or lactating females or women planning pregnancy during
the time of the study. Mentally incapacitated persons or persons patients protected
by the law were also excluded from the study. Also excluded were patients with
urticarial vasculitis and CSU patients who had undergone or were undergoing
treatment with anti-IgE (omalizumab). Further exclusion criteria included the use of
immunosuppressive drugs for 3 months or corticosteroids for 1 month before the
screening visit or during the course of the study. The use of tricyclic antidepressants,
doxepin, leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), H2-antihistamines,
sulphasalazine, dapsone, tranexamic acid, warfarin or heparin during the 4 weeks
before the screening visit and during the course of the study was prohibited. The use
of H;-antihistamines was allowed in case of high urticaria activity (UAS 2 6) or in
case of an emergency during the baseline scoring for UAS7 over 2 weeks (see
section on UAS7 and correction or antihistamines). However, no H,-antihistamines

were allowed during the 3 days prior to the diagnostic visit.

Autologous Serum Skin Test (ASST)

The autologous serum skin test was performed as recommended by the 2009
EAACI/GA°LEN task force consensus report on the autologous serum skin test in
urticaria (26) and as previously described (27). Wheal responses were measured at
30 min, and the ASST response was taken to be positive, when the red serum
induced wheal had a diameter at least 1.5 mm greater than the negative control (28).

Basophil Histamine Release Assay (BHRA)

The serum-induced BHRA was to detect autoantibodies in patients’ sera that are
directed against IgE or high affinity IgE receptors (FceRl). The assay was performed
by a single centre (RefLab, Copenhagen) as previously reported (14). Briefly, a buffy
coat containing 1-2 % basophils was prepared from fresh blood from four individual
donors. The buffy coats were mixed an equal volume of RPMI and stored overnight
at 2-8 °C. with IL 3 in a final concentration of 1 ng/ml. The following day the buffy
coats were centrifuged to remove plasma and RPMI, washed with physiological
saline and subsequently exposed to low pH using a stripping buffer, pH 3.6 from
RefLab, to partially remove IgE from the basophils. Finally, the IgE-stripped samples
were resuspended in Pipes buffer from RefLab before incubation with patient sera.
Patient sera, at dilutions of 20%, and stripped buffy coat cells were incubated in a
total volume of 100 ul for 60 minutes at 37 °C. After centrifugation 25 pL
supernatants were transferred to glass fibre coated microliter plates and histamine
was measured according to RefLab instructions. Total histamine content was
determined after lysis of cells with 7 % perchloric acid. The assay variation was < 7
% and its sensitivity 5 ng histamine /ml. A positive BHRA result was when histamine

release was above 16.5% (29).

Basophil activation test (BAT)

The BAT was performed using sera as previously described (30, 31). Briefly, blood
from healthy donors was centrifuged and the buffy coat collected and resuspended
in stimulation buffer containing 2 ng/ml IL-3. The cells were then stimulated with 50
ul of patient sera. After 30 min at 37°C, the stimulation was stopped and the serum

was eliminated by washing the samples with cold washing buffer (PBS, 2 mM

EDTA). Samples were labeled with anti-lgE FITC and anti-CD63 PE for 30 min at
4°C. The erythrocytes were lysed for 10 min at room temperature, and the samples
were washed twice prior to analyzing them in a FACSCanto II flow cytometer
(FACScan). Data were analyzed with FlowJo Tree Star software (Ashland, OR,
USA). In all cases, dead cells were eliminated based on their forward (FSC) and side
scattering (SSC) profiles (30). The test, which was performed in a single center, was
considered positive when more than 5% of the total basophils were CD63
positive, the value of the 95" percentile of CD63+ cells induced by control sera as

previously described (31).

IgG-anti-FceRI

IgG antibodies to FceRla in CSU and control sera were detected using ELISA.
FceRla (50 ng/ml, Mybiosource, San Diego, CA) was used to coat ELISA plates
(Corning 3690, Kennebunk, ME). Following blocking with 10% FBS-PBST, 1:100
diluted CSU and healthy control sera, pre-incubated for one hour with and without
100 ng/ml soluble FceRla, were added to the plate in parallel for a 2-hour incubation,
AP-labeled goat-anti-human IgG (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) was used as the
secondary detecting reagent and a reduction of signal by more than 50% was

considered to indicate the presence of IgG antibodies to FceRla.
IgG-anti-IgE

Anti-lgE antibodies were assessed by ELISA as described (27). Extinctions of >0.2

at 490 nm were considered positive.

This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
IgG-anti-thyroperoxidase (IgG-anti-TPO) and total serum IgE

IgG-anti-TPO was measured by immunoassay (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics)

and total serum IgE by immunoassay (Immuno-CAP-Fluorescence-Assay, Thermo
Scientific) or nephelometric analysis in each study centre using their own standard
procedures. The cut off value that was used to determine a low IgE level was 40

IU/ml.

UAS7 and correction for intake of H;-antihistamines

The seven-day once daily urticaria activity score (UAS7) including wheal number and
itch severity scores were assessed as described by the 2017 revision and update of
the EAACI/GA?LEN/EDF/WAO guideline for the definition, classification, diagnosis,
and management of urticaria (1). The UAS7 was calculated as the sum score of 7
days (minimum: 0, maximum: 42), using the following modification to minimize the
influence of on demand antihistamine medication. Antihistamine on demand
medication was restricted to days on which patients had high disease activity, as
reflected by a maximum UAS value of 6 for that day. The UAS score for the following
day was not counted towards the UAS7, i.e. the day was censored, unless high
disease activity was documented for this day, i.e. UAS = 6. The UAS7 was
calculated by adding the UAS of the 7 non-censored days closest to the time point of

evaluation.

Quality of Life assessment

Patients’ quality of life (QoL) was assessed using the Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life
questionnaire (CU-Q20L) (32) validated in the local language as recommended by
the 2017 EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF/WAO Guideline for the Definition, Classification,
Diagnosis and Management of Urticaria (1). CU-Q2oL measures various aspects of

QoL on a 0-100 scale with low scores indicating better QoL.

Statistical Analyses

Binominal variables were analyzed using Chi-square test. The numbers of patients
within groups were compared using Fisher’s Exact test. Continuous variables were
compared using Mann-Whitney test. Correlations were calculated using Spearman's
rank correlation coefficient and tested using asymptotic t approximation. P < 0.05

was considered to indicate statistical significance.

Results

Many CSU patients exhibit one or two, but not all three diagnostic criteria of

aiCSU

Of 182 CSU patients analyzed, 160 had at least one of the three criteria of aiCSU,
107 had a positive ASST (ASST+, 59%), 46 had a positive result in either the
basophil histamine release assay, the basophil activation test or both) (BASO+,
25%), and 105 had positive serum levels of IgG-anti-Fce RI, lgG-anti-IgE or both)
(IgG-anti-Fc RI+/lgE+, 58%). In total, 15 of 182 patients (8%) in the predefined

PURIST population fulfilled all three criteria of aiCSU (Figure 1).

The demographic and clinical features of aiCSU are not unique

Patients with aiCSU were demographically and clinically similar to CSU patients who
had no criteria of aiCSU (non-aiCSU) and to CSU patients with one or two, but not all
three, criteria of aiCSU (partial-aiCSU, Table 1). There were large ranges in median
patient age and duration of disease in all groups of patients with only small
differences between them. The majority of patients in all three groups were female.
There was no significant difference between the percentage of patients with
angioedema, 56% - 80%, in the different groups. Urticaria activity and impact as
assessed by UAS7 and CU-Q2oL, respectively, were compared. Except for higher
disease activity (UAS7) in aiCSU patients vs non-aiCSU patients (P = 0.016),
scoring was similar in all groups (Table 1). Additional demographic and clinical
parameters were assessed, but were also not specific for aiCSU (Supplemental

Table 1).

Patients with aiCSU exhibit a unique immunological profile

Patients with aiCSU had markedly lower total IgE levels, i.e. 22 vs 102 and 108 IU/ml
(P< 0.001 and P< 0.0001) and higher rates of low total IgE (< 40 IU/ml, P< 0.01 and
P< 0.0001) compared with non-aiCSU and partial-aiCSU patients respectively (Table
1). Also, IgG-anti-TPO levels were markedly higher in aiCSU (P < 0.01 and P <
0.0001), and the rates of elevated IgG-anti-TPO were greater (P< 0.05 and P< 0.01)
than in either non-aiCSU or partial-aiCSU patients. The proportions of patients, who
had low IgE levels and elevated IgG-anti-TPO levels, were higher in aiCSU patients
(41%) than in partial-aiCSU patients (9%) and non-aiCSU patients (0%).
Furthermore, the mean ratio of |gG-anti-TPO levels to IgE levels in aiCSU patients

was some 15 times greater than in partial-aiCSU patients (P < 0.0001) and some 35

times greater than in non-aiCSU patients (P = 0.025) (Figure 2). Patients with aiCSU
also showed higher rates of basopenia in comparison to partial-aiCSU patients
(P=0.035). The overall occurrence of autoimmune diseases, including vitiligo were

found to be similar between groups (Table 1).

The immunological profile of aiCSU patients is shared with BASO+ CSU
patients, but not ASST+ or IgG-anti-FceRI+/IgE+ CSU patients

Patients with aiCSU and BASO+ CSU patients had comparable levels of total IgE,
which were markedly lower than those of ASST+ or IgG-anti-FceRI+/IgE+ patients
(Table 2). aiCSU patients and BASO+ CSU patients also had comparable levels of
serum IgG-anti-TPO, which were markedly higher than those of ASST+ and IgG antiFceRI+/lgE+ patients. Similar to aiCSU patients, levels of total IgE and of IgG-antiTPO were inversely correlated in BASO+ patients (r = -0.354, P = 0.03), which they
were not in ASST+ or IgG-anti-FceRI+/lgE+ patients. Also, the rates of patients who
had both, low IgE and elevated IgG-anti- TPO levels were similar in aiCSU patients
(41%) and BASO+ CSU patients (39%) and higher than in ASST+ patients (18 %) or

IgG-anti-FceRI+/IgE+ patients (19 %).

Can a positive basophil reactivity assay predict aiCSU?

From the data in Table 2 it was calculated that BASO+ was 100% predictive for
aiCSU against non-aiCSU. In contrast, ASST+ and IgG-anti-FceRI+/IgE+ were only
27% and 28% predictive for aiCSU against non-aiCSU, respectively. To investigate
which individual basophil test was more predictive for aiCSU against non-aiCSU, the
immunological profiles of the basophil histamine release assay (BHRA) and basophil

activation test (BAT) were determined separately (Table 3). Calculations made from

these data showed that the predictive value of BHRA of 88% was higher than that of

BAT of 69%. No tests were significantly predictive for aiCSU against partial-aiCSU.

Discussion

The results of the PURIST study, the first study to assess CSU patients with three
criteria to define a subgroup of patients with aiCSU as tightly as possible, show that
aiCSU is distinct from non-aiCSU in its immunological profile. Low IgE and elevated
IgG-anti-TPO are key features of this immunological profile and inversely correlated
in aiCSU patients. Basophil tests for serum autoreactivity are best at predicting

aiCSU.

This study, by design, included more ASST+ than ASST- patients, which is why 61%
of our patients were ASST+. This is higher than the rate of ASST+ patients in the
general population of CSU patients. In CSU patients tested consecutively at
specialized urticaria centers, the average rate of ASST+ was 38%.(33) The ASST+
rate is likely to be even lower in patients seen by general practitioners or specialists
outside of urticaria centers. Despite the positive selection towards ASST-+ in the
PURIST patient population, only 8% of patients had true aiCSU, i.e. fulfilled all three

criteria of autoimmune CSU, ASST+, BASO+, and IgG-anti-Fc RI+/IlgE+.

aiCSU patients did have higher disease activity as illustrated by a significantly higher
UAS7, but did not show differences in disease duration, angioedema frequency,
quality of life scores compared to CSU patients who do not have aiCSU. We
identified a trend towards later onset of disease, higher female preponderance,

shorter duration of disease and higher rates of angioedema, but these were not

statistically significant. Previous studies, in which one or two criteria of aiCSU were
assessed in CSU patients, demonstrated higher urticaria activity and impact in these
patients. For example, Sabroe and coworkers reported that ASST+ patients had
more wheals, with a wider distribution, higher itch scores and more systemic
symptoms, than ASST- patients.(34) Caproni and coworkers showed that the overall
frequency of urticarial episodes during the week before skin testing and number of
spontaneous wheals were greater in ASST+ patients.(35) In another study, ASST+
and BAT+ CSU patients also had significantly higher UAS7 values than ASST- and
BAT- CSU patients.(36) At present, we cannot explain why this is. Differences in how
disease activity was assessed may be relevant. PURIST, unlike earlier studies, used
a unique UAS7 assessment that allowed for measuring disease activity without
regular antihistamines. Possibly the numbers of aiCSU patients in PURIST were too
low to detect statistically different clinical features. What is clear though is that
physicians cannot know from what they learn from their CSU patients’ history,
whether they have aiCSU or not. This, however, may be important and helpful and

could improve management and treatment decisions, as we discuss below.

Importantly, aiCSU patients have low total IgE, (median 30 IU), and 2 of 3 aiCSU
patients have total IgE of less than 40 IU/ml. Previous studies have shown that
serum autoreactivity assessed by BAT, a feature of aiCSU, is inversely correlated to
IgE levels (37) and that total IgE serum levels are significantly lower in BAT+ than
BAT- CSU patients as well as in ASST+ vs ASST- CSU patients.(38) IgE levels in
partial-aiCSU and non-aiCSU PURIST patients were more than three times higher,

on average higher than 100 IU/ml (the upper limit of normal). Their IgE levels and

rates of elevated IgE were similar to those reported previously for CSU patients.(11,

39)

Our study does not provide an explanation for why patients with aiCSU have low
levels of IgE, and this needs to be addressed by future studies. The non- and
possibly also the partial-aiCSU PURIST patients may have type | autoallergic CSU
(aaCSU). Their total IgE levels may be elevated, because they make IgE to
autoallergens. The presence of IgE against autoallergens in CSU patients has
recently been shown to be linked to elevated total IgE levels.(40) Is the fact that
aiCSU patients have low IgE levels clinically relevant? Low IgE levels have been
linked by several studies to lower rates of response to anti-IgE treatment with
omalizumab in CSU patients,(15, 41-43) suggesting that aiCSU patients respond
differently to omalizumab. In line with this, a positive BAT and/or ASST is linked to

slower responses to omalizumab.(14)

The other immunological marker that we identified in aiCSU patients, viz their high
IgG-anti-TPO levels and >50% rate of IgG-anti-TPO elevation, is just as interesting
and important. In a previous study, 31% of BHRA+ CSU patients were positive for
thyroid autoantibodies (AAbs), compared with only 12% of BHRA- patients.(7) Ina
recent systematic review, the frequency of elevated antithyroid AAbs varied from 4%
to 37% in 24 studies on CSU patients, and two-thirds of these studies reported rates
of increased antithyroid AAbs in 210% of CSU patients.(22) Taken together, these
findings suggest that the increased rates of anti-thyroid AAb elevation and comorbid
autoimmune thyroid diseases observed in the total CSU population is largely driven

by the aiCSU subpopulation of CSU exhibiting these immunological features. The

ability to distinguish aiCSU patients from other CSU patients would facilitate targeted
screening of this subpopulation for autoimmune comorbidities,(44) which this study

found to be more common in aiCSU patients.

Interestingly, the immunological profile of aiCSU patients is shared by BASO+ CSU
patients but not ASST+ or IgG anti-FceRI/IgE+ CSU patients, and a positive BAT or
BHRA predicts aiCSU. This is helpful information for clinical practice as both, the
BAT and the BHRA, are relatively easy to perform and commercially available.
Compared with performing the ASST and measuring autoreactivity by basophil
testing and assessing IgG-anti-FceRI and IgG-anti-IgE to identify aiCSU patients, the
BAT or the BHRA alone is almost as sensitive and specific. Although this was not the
focus of this study and further analyses are needed, between the BAT and the

BHRA, the BHRA showed the higher predictive value for aiCSU, almost 90%.

The PURIST study and these first analyses of its results come with several strengths
and limitations, and they raise some important questions that need further research.
The strengths include the large size of the multicentric and international PURIST
CSU patient population studied and that we assessed all of these patients for three
diagnostic criteria predefined for the purpose of aiCSU as well as the use of the two
different assays available to screen CSU patients for serum autoreactivity, the BAT
and the BHRA. Among its limitations, some of the routine assays were not done by a
central laboratory, but rather by the centers involved, which may have increased the
heterogeneity of data. Another interesting question to answer now is to figure out the
underlying cause or causes in the more than 90% of CSU patients who do not meet

the combined criteria for aiCSU. Testing non-aiCSU and partial-aiCSU patients for

aaCSU, i.e. CSU due to IgE to autoallergens, should be an aim of future studies.
Other questions raised by our results include whether the BHRA is truly better than
the BAT in identifying aiCSU (and if so why) and why aiCSU patients have lower
than normal IgE levels. In terms of the clinical implications of our findings, larger
studies are needed to better define the distinct clinical features of aiCSU patients
and their responsiveness to anti-IgE treatment and to cyclosporine. Previous studies
have shown that partial-aiCSU patients respond less well to omalizumab, slower and

less often,(15, 45) and better to cyclosporine.(46)

In conclusion, the findings of this study show that aiCSU is a relatively small but
immunologically quite distinct subgroup of CSU. The immunological profile of aiCSU
patients suggests that they could benefit from specific management and treatment.
Inclusion of the BHRA or the BAT in the diagnostic work up of CSU patients may

allow for the identification of aiCSU patients in clinical practice.
