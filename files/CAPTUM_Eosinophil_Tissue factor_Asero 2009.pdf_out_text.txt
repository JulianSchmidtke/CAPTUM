Eosinophils in Chronic Urticaria: Supporting or
Leading Actors?

Riccardo Asero, MD,’ Massimo Cugno, MD,’ and Alberto Tedeschi, MD?

 

Abstract: Although their number may be increased in skin lesions,
eosinophils have been rather neglected as possible participants to the
pathogenesis of chronic urticaria because of the absence of peripheral eosinophilia in patients with this disease. However, recent data
suggest a potentially relevant role played by activated eosinophils
both in triggering the tissue factor pathway of coagulation cascade
and as a source of vascular endothelial growth factor. Such phenomena seem more pronounced in patients showing a more severe
disease. The present study will rediscuss the potential role of this
cell line in chronic urticaria in the light of these recent observations.

INTRODUCTION

hronic urticaria (CU), defined as the occurrence of spon
taneous wheals, with or without angioedema, for more
than 6 weeks is a rather frequent disorder. As in most other
types of urticaria, the pathophysiologic basis of CU is unquestionably the recurrent degranulation of dermal mast cells
and of basophils. Mast cells and, to a lesser extent, basophils,
are generally regarded as the main effectors of this disease.
However, the events occurring upstream and eventually resulting in histamine release from these cells are partially
defined. Studies carried out during the last 2 decades have led
to the detection of functional autoantibodies to the high
affinity IgE receptor, FceRI, or to IgE that are able to cause
degranulation and histamine release from both mast cells and
basophils.'-+ Complement plays a relevant role in this process by enhancing histamine release induced by FceRI autoantibodies.>° However, it is generally agreed that autoantibodies to FceRI or to IgE can be detected in less than 50% of
CU patients. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that

autoantibodies and in vivo autoreactivity can also be
detected in other conditions and in healthy subjects.7~!° All
this means that the factors triggering histamine release in
chronic urticaria remain a mystery in many cases. The
reported efficacy of omalizumab in patients with refractory
CU either with or without detectable autoantibodies!!"!5
and the observed, although not totally specific, inhibitory
effect of heparin on autoantibody-triggered histamine release from basophils in vitro,'®!7 suggest a common final
pathway in histamine release, irrespective of the histamine-releasing factor involved.

HISTOLOGY OF CU

It is generally accepted that the histologic picture is
more or less the same in all patients with CU irrespective of
the presence or absence of autoantibodies. A perivascular
infiltrate of CD4* lymphocytes is always present.'* Infiltrating
cells have the characteristics of both T,,1 and T,,2 cells;
increased numbers of intradermal CD3, CD4, CD8-positive T
cells have been detected with a T,,0 cytokine profile. Neutrophils and a variable degree of eosinophils are also
present.'!2° Eosinophils are often activated, particularly in
patients without autoantibodies,?° and major basic protein can
be measured in urticaria lesion even when eosinophils are
not detected.?! The number of mast cells has been reported
as increased in urticaria lesions!* although this finding has
not been confirmed by more recent studies,!?2? and some
basophil infiltration is also observed. It has been suggested
that the infiltrate is similar to that of an allergy late-phase
reaction.?3.24
Interestingly, the eosinophil-derived major basic protein has been identified in autologous serum skin test site
biopsies, along with eosinophil infiltration.2° The immune
mechanisms and the main effector cells involved in chronic
urticaria are shown in Figure 1.

 

WHO ACTIVATES MAST CELLS WHEN

AUTOANTIBODIES ARE NOT PRESENT?

During the last 5 years, our group has spent some time
and effort trying to respond to this question by measuring the
circulating levels of some mediators potentially able to induce mast-cell degranulation and histamine release. In view
of the constant absence of blood eosinophilia in CU, we
measured serum levels of some substances not specifically
related with eosinophils, namely stem cell factor,2° substance
P,?? and interleukin (IL)-18.*8 However, the concentration of

FIGURE 1. Immune mechanisms and main effector cells involved in chronic urticaria. A, Mast cells are activated either by

autoantibodies to FceRI or IgE and/or by other histamine releasing factors and release several mediators (histamine, leukotrienes, VEGF) that concur to produce the marked vasodilation that stands at the basis of both wheal-and flare reaction and angioedema. Some mediators and chemokines released by mast cells can recruit and activate eosinophils that in turn release inflammatory mediators and produce tissue factor, the main initiator of the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade. The
major basic protein released by eosinophils can induce mast cell degranulation. B, Eosinophils can be activated either directly
by autoantibodies against the low affinity IgE receptor or indirectly by mast-cell derived mediators. C, Activated T-cells can
induce mast cell degranulation by cell-to-cell contact. This process leads to the formation and release of cytokines such as
TNF-a that has the capacity to induce gene expression in mast cells by an autocrine mechanism. ECP, eosinophil cationic protein; GM-CSF, granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor; MBP, major basic protein; PAF, platelet-activating factor; SCF,

these mediators did not significantly differ between patients
and controls. Recently, we have been luckier when, based on
the observation of a higher prevalence of positive autologous
plasma skin test over autologous serum skin test, we started
looking at the coagulation cascade and were able to demonstrate that CU is characterized by thrombin generation,?
which is the result of an activation of the tissue pathway of
blood coagulation.*°3! Notably, studies in animal models
have shown that thrombin is able to induce mastcell degranulation,*? and in rat mast cell populations, the response to
thrombin is equipotent with FceRI-mediated activation.*+
Thus (although evidence that thrombin induces mast cells
degranulation in humans is still missing), thrombin might be
a candidate mast-cell activating factor, at least in patients
whose sera don’t contain autoantibodies and show an activation of coagulation cascade. One good question is if thrombin
activates all mast cells, why do we see just skin mast cell
activation in CU? In other words, why is there skin selectivity
in CU? In effect, there are studies showing that in CU patients

 

214

there is bronchial hyper-responsiveness and, sometimes,
frank asthma.*+35

EOSINOPHILS AS ACTIVATORS OF THE
COAGULATION CASCADE AND AS SOURCE OF
VEGF IN CHRONIC URTICARIA (FIG. 2)

Interestingly, although the role of other cells cannot be
tuled out, investigating further the activation of the coagulation cascade, we found that the cells expressing tissue factor
in chronic urticaria, and hence triggering the activation of the
extrinsic pathway, are eosinophils.*° In fact, immunohistochemical experiments showed that tissue factor colocalized
with eosinophil cationic protein, a classic cell marker of
eosinophils. These findings highlight the importance of eosinophils in chronic urticaria as a source of tissue factor, in
keeping with recent studies showing that eosinophils store
tissue factor and rapidly transfer it to the cell membrane
during activation.*’ The strong expression of tissue factor in

chronic urticaria lesional skin may be because of eosinophil
activation, even if patients with chronic urticaria do not show
peripheral eosinophilia, probably because tissue factor facilitates the early transendothelial migration of the eosinophils.?7 It is interesting to note that eosinophils in chronic
urticaria may be activated both by direct and indirect mechanisms. In a single, hitherto unconfirmed, study autoantibodies directed against CD23, the low-affinity IgE receptor
located on eosinophil membrane, have been detected in about
65% of chronic urticaria patients. These autoantibodies can
activate eosinophils inducing the release of major basic protein, which in turn causes mast cell degranulation.*® In addition, eosinophil involvement might be secondary to the mast
cell activation caused by anti-FceRI and anti-[gE autoantibodies or other histamine-releasing factors. It has been demonstrated that several mediators and cytokines released by
activated mast cells can recruit and stimulate eosinophils.
Among others, mast cells represent an important source of
IL-5, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, platelet-activating factor and eotaxin, molecules that can exert potent chemotactic
and stimulating activities on eosinophils.2°4°

One further recent observation is that patients with CU
show a significant increase of vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF).*! VEGF is the most potent regulator of
angiogenesis presently known, and one of the major mediators of vascular permeability; furthermore, it exerts a vaso
© 2009 World Allergy Organization

dilator effect through an increase of nitric oxide production
by endothelial cells.4243 Notably, eosinophils are the main
source of VEGF in CU as well,*! in agreement with the in
vitro observations that human peripheral blood eosinophils
have the capacity to induce angiogenesis.** All these findings
clearly suggest that eosinophils might play a role in chronic
urticaria.

WHO IS ACTIVATING WHOM?

As reviewed above, it seems rather clear that both mast
cells and eosinophils are activated in CU. Who is the one that
starts all the process? Is eosinophil activation the result of
mast cell-derived mediators release or are eosinophils themselves the cause of mast cell activation and subsequent
histamine release?

It cannot be excluded that the leading actor may change
in different subsets of patients. In patients showing circulating FceRI and anti-I[gE autoantibodies it is very likely that the
main actor is the mast cell whereas in other patients showing
only anti-FceRII autoantibodies such role might be played by
eosinophils. Finally, it cannot be excluded that T cells, which
have been found in chronic urticaria lesional skin, also play a
relevant role, possibly by activating the mast cells via a
cell-to-cell contact. In fact, it has been demonstrated that T
cells can activate mast cells by cell-to-cell contact, thus

provoking the release of cytokines and inflammatory mediators such as histamine, TNF-a and matrix metalloproteinase9.4546 Furthermore, an aberrant signaling through the
p21Ras pathway has been found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with chronic urticaria, a finding
that is in agreement with lymphocyte activation and supports the autoimmune basis of the disease.*” Finally, the
clinical response of chronic urticaria to corticosteroid
treatment suggests to the importance of the cellular infiltrate (T cells, eosinophils, or even basophils) because mast
cells tend to be steroid-resistant.
