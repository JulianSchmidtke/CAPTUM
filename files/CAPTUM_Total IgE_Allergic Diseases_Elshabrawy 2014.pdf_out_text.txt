Background: There are multiple environmental factors that influence a sensitized (IgE antibody positive) patient's predisposition
to manifest allergic symptoms following allergen exposure. The majority of allergens are known to induce morbidity with chronic
symptoms such as rhinitis, pruritis, dermatitis and urticaria.

Aim: To study the impact of environmental and agricultural pollutants with different pollens on the immunological, hematological
and biochemical markers and to determine the prevalence of sensitization to allergens among exposed individuals as well as to
identify the eliciting allergens.

Subjects and Methods: Ninety six highly exposed individuals to environmental and agricultural pollution in addition to 20 as
controls were selected. A solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the EUROLINE test kit were used for the
quantitative determination of total IgE concentration and semi-quantitative in vitro assay of human IgE antibodies to some of the
inhalant, ingestant and contactant allergens in serum samples, respectively. Percentage and absolute eosinophil counts and
biochemical parameters were analyzed.

Results: Thirteen (13.5%) out of the 96 studied highly exposed subjects were manifesting allergic symptoms. Higher significant
total serum IgE levels and absolute eosinophil counts in groups 1 and 3 of the highly exposed individuals compared to the
control group were found (p1=0.00, p3=0.001 and p1=0.016, p3=0.028, respectively). Higher sensitization with inhalant Timothy
grass, Aspergillus fumigatus, Der. Farinae and Olive; ingestant Egg yolk, Mango, Strawberry and Codfish and with contactant
Latex/plastic and Crude oil was found in the studied groups compared with the controls.

Conclusion: The present data suggest that the highly exposed subjects to pollution are at high risk of developing an allergy. For
the screening of those with suspected allergen sensitization, the determination of specific IgE antibodies is a suitable marker of
type | allergy.

Key words: Environmental and agricultural pollens, Recombinant allergens, Specific IgE antibodies.

Introduction

The prevalence of allergic diseases has
increased worldwide, a phenomenon that can
be largely attributed to environmental effects
and it is agreed that genetic changes in
populations would be too slow to account for
such a rapid change in prevalence. ‘ Among
environmental factors, air pollution due to
traffic is thought to be a major threat to health.
Residing near busy roadways is associated
with increased asthma hospitalization,
decreased lung function, and _ increased
prevalence and severity of wheezing and
allergic rhinitis and bronchitis. Particulate
matter and ground level ozone are the most
frequent air pollutants that cause harmful
effects, and the mechanisms underlying these
effects may be related to oxidative stress. ”

Inhalant allergens from grass or tree
pollens, house dust mite and animal dander
are the major substances that are capable of
provoking type | hypersensitivity. An individual
who has hypersensitivity to pollen often suffers
from seasonal allergic rhinitis or extrinsic
asthma. °

Ingestant allergens often refer to
substances inducing allergy after the
sensitized individuals eating a certain food.
Typical symptoms of this type of allergy include
mouth or throat itching and lip swelling. °
Latex is the most important contactant
allergens in plants. Since the late 1980's, this
immediate-type allergy provoked by natural
rubber products has been reported around the
world. “”®

In atopic individuals, elevated total serum
IgE levels have also been associated with a
predisposition for airway hyper-responsiveness
and asthma. °) Detection of allergen-specific
IgE has been generally considered the more
Clinically useful analyte, since it is a specific
biomarker for the atopic state which allows
linkage of symptoms to particular allergen
exposure. Detection of allergen-specific IgE
antibodies in serum has been used clinically to
confirm sensitization to a particular allergen in
support of a history-based diagnosis of allergic
forms of rhinitis, asthma, dermatitis, urticaria,
angioedema, conjunctivitis, anaphylaxis and
food and insect sting allergy. “

The precise knowledge of the patient's
allergenic profile helps to choose a better
targeted immunotherapy. The selection of an

appropriate allergen extract containing
precisely defined amount of an_ individual
active molecule and/or molecules might lead to
optimization of immunotherapy and reduction
of adverse side effects of possible: newly
formed specific IgE antibodies. ‘"" )

The work aimed to study the impact of
environmental and agricultural pollutants with
different allergens on the immunological,
hematological and biochemical markers and to
determine the prevalence of sensitization to
different inhalant, ingestant and contactant
allergens among exposed individuals as well
as to identify the eliciting allergens. Also,
correlate the degree of allergens exposure with
deterioration of respiratory health in exposed
individuals.

Subjects and Methods:

Study subjects:

This is a case control study in which the 96
highly exposed individuals to pollution in
addition to 20 with no or minimal level of
exposure (with age ranged from 20 to 43
years) were selected within the period from
May 2012 to November 2012 according to the
following criteria: job-related allergic disorders
either with previous history or manifesting
symptoms; response to anti-allergy therapy
and the work duration at fields of exposure. All
subjects of the studied groups and control
group were males. Informed consent was
obtained from all participants and the study
was approved by ethics and_ scientific
committees in the university. Complete
demographic data including: age, job
description and history of allergic disorders;
type; duration; family history and drug intake
were taken from every subject.

According to site of pollution’s exposure,
four groups were selected and divided into:

(1) Thirty two people from the farm area
(workers and constant living populations)
and forestry workers.

(2) Thirty two workers in petrol stations.

(3) Thirty two road construction workers.

(4) Twenty healthy age- and sex-matched
subjects were included as a control group.

Blood samples:
One venous blood sample (10 ml) was
obtained from each subject and control and

processed at research laboratory; One ml of
EDTA-blood samples for complete blood count
and the remaining of samples were
centrifuged to obtain serum samples that
frozen at -20°C until analysis for
measurement of other parameters. Also,
heparin-arterial blood samples were taken,
transported on ice and analyzed for blood CO2
level. ‘?

Immunological, hematological and
biochemical markers were investigated and
included:

(1) Total serum IgE level:

A solid phase enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay for the quantitative
determination of total IgE concentration in
human serum samples was used (Pishtaz
Teb Diagnostics, ID Consulting Services
Ltd. Korbach/Germany) according to the
manufacturer's guidelines. Reading was
done using Robonic Readwell Strip ELISA
Analyzer, India.

Serum levels of allergen-specific IgE:

The EUROLINE test kit was used for
semi-quantitative in vitro assay of human
allergen-specific IgE antibodies
(EUROIMMUN, Medizinische,
Labordiagnostika AG) against some of the
common commercially available
inhalation, plant and animal food and
contact allergens in serum samples. The
test kit contains test strips coated with
parallel lines of 21 different allergens
extract. The test strips were first
moistened and then incubated in the first
reaction step with patient serum. In
positive samples, specific antibodies of
class IgE were bound to the allergens and
detected by second incubation using an
enzyme-labelled monoclonal anti-human
IgE catalyzing a colour reaction. The band
positions and intensity of staining must be
taken into consideration. By comparing
the incubated test strips with the printed
evaluation strip, the allergens against
which IgE antibodies are present could be
identified. The signals can be divided into
four classes which correspond to the
bands.

Total and differential leukocytic counts:
Total and differential leukocytic counts
were determined from EDTA-venous
blood samples using an autoanalyzer and

calculated.

Biochemical parameters including kidney
function tests, liver function tests and
blood glucose test were measured by
using Spectrum Diagnostic Reagent, The
Creative Approach to Bioscience (Robonic
Prietest Autobiochemistry analyzer, India).
Blood CO, level was measured using

Results:

Thirteen (13.5%) out of the studied highly
exposed subjects were manifesting allergic
symptoms. All subjects of the studied groups
and control group were males.

The immunological and hematological
markers of the studied subjects in relation to
the control group were summarized in Table 1.
There was higher significant total serum IgE
level in groups 1 and 3 of the highly exposed
individuals compared with the control group
(p1=0.00; 95% Cl, 122.2-164.9 and p3=0.001;
95% Cl, 100.4-147.1, respectively). The total
leukocytic count was significantly higher in
group 1 of the study subjects than the controls
(p1=0.015). Regarding the percentage and
absolute eosinophil counts, there were higher
significant counts in groups 1 and 3 of the
highly exposed individuals than the controls
(p1=0.028, p3=0.007 and p1=0.016, p3=0.028;
95% Cl, 0.5-0.89, 0.4-0.89, respectively).

As summarized in Table 2, there were
slightly higher significant levels of serum
bilirubin and serum creatinine in group 1 of the
highly exposed subjects than the controls
(p1=0.005; 95% Cl, 0.96-1.13 and p1=0.004;
95% Cl, 0.98-1.13, respectively) with no
statistical differences in other parameters
between the studied groups and the control
group (p1, p2, p3>0.05).

The serum samples of the studied subjects
were tested with a panel of 21 common
commercially available allergenic extracts to
each of inhalant, ingestant and contactant
allergens for determination of the rate of
occurrence of specific IgE antibodies against
these different allergens.

As shown in Table 3, high sensitization to
inhalant allergens was observed with Timothy
Grass in 25% (8/32) of group 1 of the studied
subjects, with Aspergillus fumigatus in 15.6%
(5/32) of group 2 and equally with Timothy
Grass, Der. Farinae and Olive in 12.5% (4/32)

of group 3. High sensitization to ingestant Egg
yolk in 18.8% (6/32) of group 1, equally to
Mango, Strawberry and Egg yolk in 12.5%
(4/32) of group 2 and to Codfish in 21.9%
(7/32) of group 3 was _ demonstrated.
Regarding contactant allergens, high
sensitization to Latex/plastic in 28.1% (9/32)
and 15.6% (5/32) of group 1 and 2,
respectively and equally to Latex/plastic and
Crude oil in 12.5% (4/32) of group 3 was
found. In contrast, only one of 20 healthy
controls reported sensitization to Egg yolk.
Significant differences were detected
concerning the sensitization to inhalant,

ingestant and contactant allergens between
the studied highly exposed groups and the
control group (p=0.00, 0.00 and 0.002,
respectively).

Semiquantitative analysis of sensitization to
inhalant, ingestant and contactant allergens in
the studied groups of highly exposed subjects
compared to the controls was demonstrated in
Tables 4, 5 and 6 according to band density as
the following: negative (no band or 0), weak
band (+), clear band (++) and intense band
(+++). The results were evaluated by
comparing the incubated test strips with the
printed evaluation strip.

Discussion

The prevalence of allergic diseases has
increased worldwide, a phenomenon that can
be largely attributed to environmental effects.
®) Oxidative stress and epigenetic mechanisms
are considered as possible mechanisms for
developing allergic disease and sensitization.
A linkage between oxidative stress and
inflammation is believed to contribute to the
pathogenesis of some allergic diseases. Many
cells and mediators are thought to modulate
the formation of reactive oxygen species,
which in turn may mediate cellular signaling
pathways related to inflammation. )

The reactive oxidative species (ROS)
produced in response to air pollutants can
overwhelm the redox system and damage the
cell wall, lipids, proteins, and DNA, leading to
airway inflammation and hyper-reactivity.
Elevated levels of ROS may induce a variety of
pathological changes that are highly relevant in
nasal and airway mucosa. These include lipid
peroxidation, increased airway reactivity,

increased nasal mucosal sensitivity and
secretions, production of chemoattractant
molecules, and increased vascular
permeability. “ Pollutants may also cause

harmful effects via epigenetic mechanisms,
28

Walaa Othman Elshabrawy et al...

which control the expression of genes without
changing the DNA sequence itself. These
mechanisms are likely to be a target for the
prevention of allergies. ‘> ‘© '”

In the present study, thirteen (13.5%) out of
96 studied highly exposed workers were
manifesting allergic symptoms and _ starting
anti-allergic therapy while, the remaining with
no symptoms. There are multiple personal and
environmental factors that influence a
sensitized (IgE antibody positive) patient's
predisposition to manifest allergic symptoms
following allergen exposure. Among these are
the magnitude and quality of the patient's
humoral immune response to the offending
allergens in question. The concentration,
affinity and clonality of the IgE antibody
response all influence how effectively the
effector cells are armed with relevant IgE
antibody and how well the IgE binds to
allergenic molecules following inhalation,
ingestion or injection. ©

IgE-mediated occupational allergic diseases
manifest clinical symptoms after a certain
period of exposure, which varies according to
the offending allergen. For example, it typically
takes one year of exposure to develop
allergies to rice powder, 5 years for olive
pollen, 5 years for sunflower pollen, and 7
years for wheat. The incubation period can
range from several weeks to 220 years. The
reasons for this may include the trans, sport time
and the settling time of pollen. ‘® * The
fraction of the total IgE that is allergen specific
may vary as a function of the allergen
specificity and thus in principal contribute to
the greater or lesser severity of allergic
symptoms.

The finding of significantly higher level of
total serum IgE among groups 1 and 3 of the
studied subjects compared with the controls
(p1=0.00; 95% Cl, 122.2-164.9 and p3=0.001;
95% Cl, 100.4-147.1, respectively) as shown in
Table 1 stresses the importance of atopy in the
expression of asthma in this community.
Immunological recognition of environmental
allergens may have an important role in the
subsequent development of asthma as the
allergens may play a dual role by inciting
episodes of wheezing and causing asthma to
develop in the first instance.

It is Known that eosinophils are the most
dominant inflammatory cells in allergic disease.

” Our results showed that the total leukocytic

count was significantly higher in group 1 of the
study subjects than the controls (p1=0.015).
Regarding the percentage and absolute
eosinophil counts, there were higher significant
counts in groups 1 and 3 of the highly exposed
individuals than the controls (p1=0.028,
p3=0.007 and p1=0.016, p3=0.028; 95% Cl,
0.5-0.89, 0.4-0.89, respectively), Table 1. In

corroboration with other study, Kartasamita et

al. reported _ statistically significant
increased levels of eosinophils amon
asthmatic children. While, Ige ef al.

observed no statistically significant differences
in the total and percentage eosinophil counts
between the asthmatic patients and the
controls although the asthmatic patients have
higher eosinophil counts. The presence and
extent of eosinophilia in the peripheral blood
may reflect the severity of the asthma and the
presence of no significant eosinophilia may
reflect that the asthma control is optimal as the
levels of peripheral eosinophils tend to fall with
better control in stable asthma. “

There were higher significant levels of
serum bilirubin and serum creatinine in group 1
of the highly exposed subjects than the
controls (p1=0.005; 95% Cl, 0.96-1.13 and
p1=0.004; 95% Cl, 0.98-1.13, respectively) but
within the normal limits with no_ statistical
differences in other parameters between the
three studied groups and the control group (p1,
p2, p3>0.05) as summarized in Table 2. Most
of the highly exposed subjects of group 1 were
Clinically manifesting allergic symptoms and
starting their anti-allergic treatment so
evaluation of serum levels to these parameters
must be continue in allergy consultation after
treatment, to know their clinical evolution, the
apparition of adverse reactions and the use of
other asthmatic medications in the period of
the treatment.

This study summarized the results
concerning the rate of occurrence of specific
IgE antibodies against different commercially
available inhalant, ingestant and contactant
allergens in a group of individuals living and or
working in the highly exposed areas in
comparison to the controls (Table 3).
Moreover, the present study demonstrated the
semiquantitative pattern of sensitization to
different allergens according to the band
density and described it as the following:
negative (no band or 0), weak band (+), clear

band (++) and intense band (+++) as shown in
Tables 4, 5 and 6.

Our results explored high sensitization to
inhalant allergens with Timothy Grass in 25%
(8/32) of group 1 of the studied subjects, with
Aspergillus fumigatus in 15.6% (5/32) of group
2 and equally with Timothy Grass, Der. Farinae
and Olive in 12.5% (4/32) of group 3. The high
sensitization to ingestant Egg yolk in 18.8%
(6/32) of group 1, equally to Mango,
Strawberry and Egg yolk in 12.5% (4/32) of
group 2 and to Codfish in 21.9% (7/32) of
group 3 was demonstrated.

In a similar study done by Ebo et al. °°) who
reported that a specific IgE antibody to at least
one of the investigated inhalant and animal
food allergens was found in respectively 76%
and 12% of the serum samples. A plant foodspecific IgE antibody was observed in 88% of
the serum samples. The higher sensitization to
inhalant and plant food allergens in this study
compared with our study could be attributed to
the studied subjects were allergic adults and all
had a history of natural rubber latex allergy
confirmed by a positive skin test for latex and a
positive latex-specific IgE. On the other hand,
similar and /or slightly higher sensitization to
animal food allergens in the current study
compared to Ebo ef al.

In a case of occupational rhinitis induced by
maize pollen exposure in a farmer, Sung et al.
4) found that the specific IgE antibodies to
crude and commercial maize pollen extracts
were higher in the patient than in the healthy
subjects.

In this study as regard with contactant
allergens, higher sensitization to Latex/plastic
in 28.1% (9/32) and 15.6% (5/32) of group 1
and 2, respectively and equally to Latex/plastic
and Crude oil in 12.5% (4/32) of group 3 was
found. Tucke et al. °°) demonstrated circulating
gE antibodies to latex in 16.2% of studied
patients. Additionally, the children with latexspecific IgE antibodies were older, had
significantly higher (p=0.003) total IgE values
than atopic patients without sensitization to
latex. The prevalence of latex sensitization
and/or allergy apparently varies widely,
depending on the population examined. In
atopic children, Liebke et al. °° reported that
20.8% (60 of 306) had increased latex-specific
gE antibodies, whereas Cremer et al. °”
found a prevalence rate of 13.6% (six of 44) for
atopic children. The _ identification and

 

characterization of allergens and _ their
structures and biological functions will be
benefit for the diagnosis and treatment of
pollen related allergic diseases.

Of the allergens causing considerable
sensitization rates, a strong association
between Latex and some food allergen
extracts most frequently to Mango and Tomato
in group 1 and Codfish in group 2 was
observed. Furthermore, co-association
between Latex and some inhaled allergens
extracts especially to Timothy grass in groups
1 and 3 while, to Olive in group 2 of the studied
highly exposed subjects was demonstrated
and this may be explained on the bases of
cross-reactivity between Latex and some foods
ana hale’ allergens as identified by Tucke et
al.

Holgate et al. and Stenfors et al.
attempted to clarify whether bronchial epithelial
cells (BECs) from asthmatic individuals were
more sensitive to DEPs than those from nonasthmatics with regard to production of proinflammatory mediators, but the data failed to
reveal exaggerated airway inflammation in
asthmatic individuals after diesel exhaust
exposure. These findings demonstrated that
diesel exhaust exposure has_ evident
inflammatory effects on the airways of nonasthmatic individuals, but this does not occur in
the presence of asthmatic airway inflammation.

Conclusion

The present data suggest that the highly
exposed subjects to environmental and
agricultural pollution are at high risk of
developing an allergy and it is important to
develop methods of identifying susceptible
individuals within a large population. For the
screening of those with suspected allergen
sensitization the determination of specific IgE
antibodies is a reliable marker of type | allergy.
Future studies should evaluate whether
measurement of airway __ inflammatory
biomarkers in bronchial epithelial cells would
be an appropriate method of assessment.
