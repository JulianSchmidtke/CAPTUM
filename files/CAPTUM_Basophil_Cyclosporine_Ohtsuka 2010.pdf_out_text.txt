Background Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is often resistant to common treatment of

Objective To find out clinical and laboratory findings affecting the response of oral
cyclosporine therapy in CIU.

Subjects and methods The response of oral cyclosporine therapy in 15 patients with CIU
(male : female = 5 : 10, age 16-60 years old, mean 40.0 years old) was studied. Cyclosporine trough level was measured with an enzyme-multiplied immunoassay, and high
sensitivity-CRP was measured with a nephelometric assay. The relation between high
sensitivity-CRP level and clinical and laboratory findings in CIU was also studied.

Results All the 15 CIU patients responded to oral cyclosporine therapy. High sensitivityCRP levels before the start of therapy were elevated in nine of 15 CIU patients. The

distributions of treatment duration and basophile leukocytes counts in elevated high
sensitivity-CRP patients (8.7 + 1.3 months, 0.20 + 0.05%) were significantly shorter and
elevated than those in patients showing no elevation (22.7 + 1.7 months, 0.40 + 0.05%)
(P< 0.05, P< 0.05), respectively. No other clinical and laboratory findings between
patients with elevated and not elevated high sensitivity-CRP showed any significant

differences.

Conclusion Chronic idiopathic urticaria patients with elevated high sensitivity-CRP showed
good response to oral cyclosporine therapy.

Introduction

Urticaria is a cutaneous vascular reaction induced

by immunological or nonimmunological mechanism.
Chronic urticaria is characterized by recurrent episodes
of transient wheals, frequently associated with angioedema, and present daily or at least twice a week for
over 6 weeks. Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is occasionally unresponsive to therapy with antihistamines and
difficult to treat. Mast-cell degranulation and release of
pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines from the
secretory granules of the mast cells play a major role in
the pathogenesis of urticaria. Immunosuppressive drugs
have been proposed in the treatment of the disease."
Cyclosporine has been used when antihistamines fail and
prolonged steroid treatment is required. This study evaluated the effectiveness of cyclosporine treatment in CIU.
Recently, high sensitivity-CRP has been shown to be
useful for potential adjunct for global risk assessment in
the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.* Clinical laboratory findings including high  sensitivity-CRP
and cyclosporine trough level affecting the treatment
were also studied.

Subjects

Fifteen patients with CIU (male : female = 5 : 10, age 16-60
years old, mean 40.0 years-old) admitted to the outpatient clinics
were studied (Table 1). The diagnosis of CIU was made as
follows; recurrent episodes of transient wheals, frequently
associated with angioedema, present daily or at least twice a
week for over 6 weeks. The patients were unresponsive to
therapy with antihistamines (epinastine hydrochloride) and
difficult to treat even with three times the standard dose (60 mg/
d). Patients with infections and those who did not tolerate
cyclosporine were excluded from the study. Three patients were
thus excluded. Autoreactive patients were patients who have
autoimmune urticaria including the patients with a positive
autologous serum test and not those who have angioedema
caused by foods. All the patients were Japanese. All the subjects
were studied for relevant clinical and laboratory findings. Clinical
findings studied in CIU patients were age, gender and treatment
duration. Laboratory findings studied in CIU patients were serum
transaminase (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine
aminotransferase), alkaline phosphatase, y-glutamil
transpeptidase, lactose dehydrogenase, serum total protein,

subjects (n = 147, male : female = 91 : 56, age

53.9 + 13.6 years old) were also studied. Patients were admitted
to my department for cryosurgery of skin tumors. They had no
systemic diseases including urticaria, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis,
connective tissue diseases, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and
hyperlipidemia.

Autologous serum test in chronic idiopathic urticaria

To perform autologous serum test, 50 sl of autologous serum
was injected into the patient’s forearm.* Equal volumes of
histamine (0.10 mg/ml; Hollister-Stir Laboratories, Spokane, WA,
USA) and saline served as the positive and negative controls.
Immediately after injection, the sizes of the wheal and flare in
millimeters at each site were recorded. Measurements were
made again after 15 min, and in some individuals, readings were
also taken at 30 min. All positive reactions were observed within
30 min, and long observation did not alter the results. A positive
result was defined as an increase in the wheal reaction size of

> 3 mm with no change or reduction in size of the saline control.

Measurement of cyclosporine trough level and monitoring
of renal function in chronic idiopathic urticaria

Patients with CIU were treated with cyclosporine (Neoral®,
Novartis Pharma, Arnhem, the Netherlands) < 5 mg/kg daily

(divided into two doses), and in which trough level was
measured in whole blood. Early morning dose trough level was
measured with an enzyme-multiplied immunoassay technique
(EMIT kit, SYVA, Dade Behring Inc., Deerfield, IL, USA).4°
Patients previously treated with cyclosporine were excluded, as
were patients with concurrent medication and/or comorbidity
with a potential influence on cyclosporine trough levels. The
initial dose of cyclosporine was 3 mg/kg daily. After 3 months of
treatment, the dose was tapered off during 1 month. Monitoring
of renal function was performed by serum creatinine
determination at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.
Cyclosporine trough levels were measured at 2 weeks after the
start of cyclosporine. Cyclosporine trough levels measured at
weeks 2 were used for statistical evaluation, because all the
patients had the same dose (3 mg/kg daily).

 

Measurement of high sens
idiopathic urticaria

High sensitivity-CRP was measured from samples drawn on
admission, and results were kept blinded from the physicians
treating the patients. Blood samples were drawn in vacuum
tubes containing lithium heparin, centrifuged, and remaining
plasma stored at —70 °C for later measurements. High
sensitivity-CRP was measured with a nephelometric assay
(Dade Behring Diagnostics, Marburg, Germany). The detection
limit was 0.0036 mg/l, linearity from 0.015 to 1.5 mg/l. The
coefficient of variation was 3.57% at a concentration of

0.021 mg/dl, 1.06% at a concentration of 0.056 mg/dl, and
3.19% at a concentration of 0.807 mg/dl. The results of
simultaneous measurements in 89 normal controls showed that
correlation coefficient between conventional CRP and high
sensitivity-CRP was 0.999.

The response of oral cyclosporine therapy in chronic
idiopathic urticaria

Oral cyclosporine therapy was judged as effective when all the
edematous erythema completely resolved and no pruritus was
found. The dose of cyclosporine was decreased by 25% when
CIU completely resolved. The dose was decreased by 25%
succeedingly, and finally discontinued.

Statistical analysis

Mann-Whitney’s U-test was used to evaluate the difference of
values between two groups. Chi-square test with Yates’
correction was used to evaluate the difference of occurrence
rate between two groups.

Discussion

This study showed that high sensitivity-CRP level was elevated in nine of 15 (60%) CIU patients. Sensitivity and
specificity of high sensitivity-CRP for ICU were 46.7%
and 98.6%, respectively. These results established the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value
of this test. These results excluded the observation by
chance. Several studies have shown the effective response
of oral cyclosporine therapy in CIU patients.°? A study

mines (12 patients). After 9 months of follow-up, 16
patients were still in full remission. Several other studies
also showed the efficacy of oral cyclosporine treatment in
CIU patients.*? Accordingly, oral cyclosporine therapy in
CIU patients unresponsive to conventional treatment is an
alternative choice for the patients.

Recently, high sensitivity-CRP has been shown to be
useful for potential adjunct for global risk assessment in
the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.* With
the recognition that inflammation is a critical component
in determinination of plaque stability'®** and with the
availability of highly sensitive assay systems, CRP levels in
the low-normal range were found to have predictive
value for individuals admitted to the hospital with acute
coronary ischemia.** Population distribution of hs-CRP
based on analysis of > 5000 Americans without known
cardiovascular disease showed 5 quintiles, which could be
considered in clinical terms to represent individuals with
low, mild, moderate, high and highest relative risks,
respectively, for future cardiovascular disease.* These
reports showed that CRP levels in the low-normal range
have predictive value for acute coronary ischemia. Elevated serum level of CRP has also been shown to be an
independent predictor of cardiovascular events in Japanese
patients with coronary artery disease.** This study found

out that CRP levels in the low-normal range have predictive value for the response to oral cyclosporine therapy
even in CIU patients.

The reason for high sensitivity-CRP elevation in CIU
remains unknown. Chronic urticaria patients are a heterogeneous group of patients who require an individualized
approach to evaluation and management.'+ A_ study
showed findings supporting the CIU autoimmune pathogenetic hypothesis.*> Before therapy, all patients showed
activated B cells (CD19+CD23+ cells) and among B
CDro9+ cells, about 20% was CD5+. After treatment with
prednisone, a significant reduction in CD4+ lymphocytes
was observed. Serum IL-2 receptor, TNF-x, and IL-5
levels of patients before cyclosporine treatment were
statistically higher than those of the control group, and
after 4 weeks of cyclosporine therapy, the mean IL-2R,
TNF-x, and IL-5 levels were significantly decreased.'® A
histological examination of CIU revealed a perivascular
nonnecrotizing infiltrate of CD4+ lymphocytes consisting
of a mixture of THr and THz subtypes, plus monocytes,
neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils.*” These cells were
recruited as a result of interactions with Csa, cell priming
cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Autologous serum test and anti-thyroid antibodies were found
positive in 28 and 12% of patients, respectively, compared with none of the normal individuals.'® The study
demonstrated that chronic urticaria duration was associated with clinical parameters such as severity and angioedema, and with laboratory parameters such as autologous
serum test and anti-thyroid antibodies. The factors affecting the occurrence of CIU remain to be elucidated including severity of angioedema, disease duration, and other
clinical factors. Disease duration should be studied in
detail, because the result of this study showed the relation
tween high sensitivity-CRP and treatment duration.

The basophil leukocyte counts in elevated high sensitivity-CRP patients were significantly lower than those in
not elevated patients. The presence of autoantibodies to
asophil degranulation phenotypes and to disease status
was compared.'? There was an enhancement in basophil
function as subjects evolved into a state of remission,
which appears independent of the presence of autoantiody. Patients with CIU with a basophil responder phenotype reported longer disease duration, a_ higher
frequency of emergency department use, and significantly
igher itch severity.*° Accordingly, the results of this
study may show that CIU activity could be represented
y an elevated high sensitivity-CRP and decreased basohil leukocyte counts.

In conclusion, an elevated high sensitivity-CRP could
e predictive and early response to oral cyclosporine therapy. This finding in this pilot study needs to be confirmed
in a larger systematic study.
