Chronic spontaneous urtcaria (CSU) can represent the leading sign of a wide spectrum
of systemic diseases, including primary immunodeficiencies. We describe the case of a
young adult female with coexisting CSU and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)
successfully treated with omalizumab. The patient, with a history of recurrent respiratory
infections during childhood, was referred to clinical attention due to the development
of refractory CSU. During the diagnostic workup for the research of secondary
causes of urticaria, an immunological assessment was performed, showing markedly
reduced levels of IgG and IgM, poor antibody response against vaccinating antigens
in absence of a T cellular deficiency. Therefore, the diagnosis of CVID was posed.
Despite the immunoglobulin replacement and a trial with intravenous immunoglobulin
at immunomodulatory dosage, the patient continued to experience severe urticaria, with
significant impairment in the quality of life. After 2 years from the diagnosis of CVID,
a treatment with omalizumab was started, showing complete remission of cutaneous
symptoms after the first injection. The drug was well-tolerated, and the patient did not
experience adverse effects during a 12-months follow-up.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is defined by the spontaneous appearance of wheals,
angioedema or both for at least 6 weeks (1). The etiology of CSU is often referred as idiopathic,
after having investigated the possible secondary causes. Interestingly, it can represent the first sign
of a wide spectrum of systemic diseases, including primary and secondary immunodeficiencies and
other conditions featured by dysregulation of the immune system or of the inflammatory response
(2). Current management of CSU is organized into a step-care fashion, which includes the use of
H1/H2-antihistamines as first step followed by immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclosporine
or the anti-IgE monoclonal antibody omalizumab, for severe refractory cases (1). However, data
on the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in patients with coexisting CSU and common variable
immunodeficiency (CVID) are lacking because primary immunodeficiency diseases are usually
excluded from clinical trials on biologics (3). Herein, we describe the first case of refractory CSU
successfully treated with omalizumab in a young adult affected with CVID, after obtaining informed
patient’s consent.

Omalizumab in Common Variable Immunodeficiency

 

CASE REPORT

We describe the case of a 19-year-old adult female with a
history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections since early
childhood and a significant episode of pneumonia requiring
prolonged hospitalization at 5 years of age. At 10 years of age,
the patient started experiencing recurrent episodes of diffuse
itching wheals, which were not apparently elicited by any
physical triggers and were sometimes associated with cough
and dyspnea. At 15 years of age, due to the worsening of the
cutaneous symptoms, almost occurring daily and persisting for
more than 6 weeks despite being treated with second-generation
H1-antihistamines at 2-fold the approved doses, a full allergy
diagnostic workup for CSU was performed: skin prick testing
for food and aeroallergens, spirometry with bronchodilator
response, a complete blood cell count with differential, C-reactive
protein, serology for Helicobacter Pylori, complement fractions
C3 and C4, antinucleus antibodies, thyroid hormones and autoantibodies, celiac disease auto-antibodies, and hepatic and renal
function produced negative or normal results.

Given her history of recurrent respiratory infections,
immunological exams were then performed, which showed a
significant reduction in two serum immunoglobulin isotypes
(IgG 449 mg/dL, —3 SD; IgM 64 mg/dL, —1 SD), low levels
of B lymphocytes (58/mm*, <1% of total lymphocytes), poor
specific humoral response against common vaccinating antigens
(anti-tetanus IgG 0.10 IU/mL, protective response >1,00
IU/mL; anti-B hepatitis IgG 0,00 mIU/mL, protective response
>10 mIU/mL) and no evidence of T cell deficiency (normal
values of T lymphocytes subset and of T cell proliferation).
Analysis for known genetic causes of hypogammaglobinemia
(including BAFE, TACI, TNFRSE, and BTK mutations) proved
negative. Therefore, considering the clinical phenotype
(increased susceptibility to infections) the immunological
features and the absence of other demonstrated causes of
hypogammaglobulinemia, a diagnosis of common variable
immunodeficiency (CVID) was made (4). Replacement
therapy with subcutaneous human immunoglobulins (Ig) (0.55
g/kg/month) was started, resulting in a significant and persistent
improvement of respiratory but not of cutaneous symptoms.
Therefore, following the first 5 months of subcutaneous Ig
replacement therapy, a trial with intravenous Ig (IVIG) at a
higher immunomodulatory dose (0.8 g/kg/month) was initiated,
resulting in moderate improvement in cutaneous symptoms,
with a reduction in the Urticaria Activity Score over 7 days
(UAS7) from 38 to 25/42 points. Nevertheless, after 3 cycles
of high-dose IVIG, the patient had a recurrence of severe
CSU and thereafter continued to experience uncontrolled
cutaneous symptoms for 2 years, despite being concomitantly
treated with different combinations of second-generation
Hl-antihistamines up to 2- to 3-fold the approved doses
together with an H2-antihistamine and/or a leukotriene receptor
antagonist (Figure 1). At the age of 17.8 years old, considering
the substantial impact of CSU on everyday quality of life with
an UAS7 of 38, and the recurrent need for short courses of
oral prednisone, an add-on treatment with omalizumab was
started, 300 mg every 4 weeks, resulting in complete remission
of urticaria symptoms within a week from the first injection,

 

 

with no further need for controller medications (Figure 1). After
6 injections, omalizumab was stopped for 2 months according
to the therapeutic schedule approved in Italy, which caused a
relapse of urticaria, albeit less severe (i.e, UAS7 of 18). She was
restarted on omalizumab, which led to an immediate resolution
of skin lesions (Figure 1). The patient continued treatment with
subcutaneous Ig, and despite having received 12 injections of
omalizumab so far, she has not reported having side-effects.

DISCUSSION

Urticaria can be the first manifestation of a wide spectrum of
conditions involving the immune and inflammatory response. In
this regard, although rare, particularly relevant is the association
between urticaria and autoinflammatory diseases featured by
alterations in the cryopririn pathway, as Cryopyrin-associated
periodic syndromes (CAPS), including Familial cold urtcaria
syndrome (FCAS), Muckle-Wells syndrome, and Chronic
infantile neurologic cutaneous articular (CINCA) syndrome (57). Moreover, urticaria is part of the complex clinical phenotype
of the recently described PLCG2-associated antibody deficiency
and immune dysregulation (PLAID) (8).

The interest on the association between immunodeficiencies
(ID), atopic disease and autoimmunity is currently increasing,
since several studies (9-12), have shown that patients with
primary ID, and particularly CVID, are a population at risk
of developing a wide spectrum of autoimmune manifestations,
with a predominance in adult females (13). Concerning CVID,
despite the absence of predictor of autoimmunity, it has been
shown that patients which develop autoimmunity often have a
marked reduction of CD19 cells, as evidenced in our patient
(14, 15). However, the presence of atopic diseases and urticaria,
although reported in a considerable percentage of patients with
IgA deficiency (16), is rarely described in patients with CVID
(13, 17). Of note, some recent case reports, mainly including adult
patients, have reported CSU as the first or the leading sign of
CVID, similar to our case (17, 18).

The complex pathogenic mechanism underlying urticaria
in CVID is not completely understood. In this setting, it
has been hypothesized that CU could be elicited either
by infections and consequent complement activation by
inappropriate humoral response, or by the high susceptibility
to autoimmune manifestations, due to the presence of antibody
against the high affinity IgE receptors FceRIa (that cause the
cross-linking of adiacent receptors) or against IgE molecules,
determining in both cases the degranulation of mast cells and
basophils (19, 20).

IVIG replacement is the mainstay treatment for CVID as it
restores antibody function (21). Additionally, IVIG therapy has
potential anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities
that might reduce autoantibody-mediated inflammation (22, 23).
As such, IVIG therapy has been shown to be effective in some
patients with refractory CSU associated with autoimmunity and
CVID (17). However, in our case, Ig administered at both
substitutive and immunomodulatory dosages did not induce a
complete resolution of CSU.

Omalizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 anti-IgE
antibody, which binds to free IgE and inhibits their interaction

with the FceRI receptors on mast cells and basophils, leading
to a downregulation of such receptors (24). Omalizumab is
recommended as a third-line treatment for refractory CSU (1),
although its definitive mechanism of action in CSU is not
currently elucidated and likely goes beyond the modulation of
mast cell and basophil IgE receptors function (24). Indeed, a fixed
dose of omalizumab is approved for all CSU patients, regardless
of serum total IgE level, as opposed to the dosing needed for
the treatment of severe asthma (24). In addition, recent evidence
showed that the change in IgE level after the first injection
of omalizumab could be the best predictor of response to this
biological treatment, as all patients with low baseline IgE (i.e.,
< 43 IU/ml) who at least doubled the total IgE levels before
the second injection of omalizumab became complete or partial
responders (25).

Available data on the efficacy and safety of omalizumab
for CSU coexisting with immunodeficiency diseases are limited
to a few case reports, mainly including patients with hyperIgE syndrome and HIV infection. In particular, Bard et al.
(26) reported that omalizumab was effective and safely used

 

in a case of hyper-IgE syn
eczema. Iemoli et al. (27) d

CONCLUDING REMARKS

We describe the first case reporting the efficacy and the shortterm safety of omalizumab for refractory CSU in an adolescent
with CVID, suggesting a possible window of opportunity for the
use this biologic agent in the immunosuppressed host. Extended
follow-up studies are needed to address the long-term safety of
omalizumab for the treatment of CSU in patients receiving Ig
replacement therapy for CVID.
