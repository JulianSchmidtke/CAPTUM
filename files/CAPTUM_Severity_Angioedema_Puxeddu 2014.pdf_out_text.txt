Abstract Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common disease
characterized by recurrent itchy wheals and/or angioedema
for more than 6 weeks. Increased levels of the pro-angiogenic mediator vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
have been described in skin disorders, such as chronic
urticaria (CU), psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Up to now,
no data on the role of VEGF endogenous inhibitors
Endostatin (ES) and Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) in CU are
available. The aim of our study is to investigate the
potential involvement of ES and TSP-1 in patients with
chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). The levels of ES and
TSP-1 were measured in the sera of 106 adult patients with
CSU and 98 healthy subjects by enzyme immunoassays.
The serum levels of the anti-angiogenic mediators ES and
TSP-1 resulted significantly higher in CSU than in control
subjects. Analysis of these mediators in CSU sub-groups,
defined by the results of the autologous serum skin test
(ASST), identified a significant increase of ES and TSP-1
in both ASST-positive and ASST-negative sub-groups as
compared to the controls. Levels of ES and TSP-1 do not
parallel the disease severity in CSU. Our study suggests
that the extracellular matrix (ECM) fragments ES and TSP1 with anti-angiogenic activity play a potential role in the
pathogenesis of CSU but do not parallel disease activity.

Introduction

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common and disabling disease
characterized by recurrent itchy wheals and/or angioedema
for more than 6 weeks [24]. These symptoms are the consequence of skin mast cells degranulation with release of
histamine and other vasoactive mediators. Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is frequently characterized by autoreactivity as intradermal injection of autologous serum
causes wheal and flare reaction in 30-60 % of patients [7].
Autoantibodies (anti-IgE, anti-FeeRI, anti-TPO) [1] are
detected in only one-third of the cases, suggesting that other
circulating mediators released by immune cells and/or
structural cells may be involved in the pathogenesis of CSU.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the main
pro-angiogenic mediator with relevant vasoactive properties. An increased VEGF has been observed in the circulation of patients with skin disorders, including CU [21].
This might be responsible for the increase of vascular
permeability in the skin, leading to the development of the
transitory itchy wheals observed in CU. The functional
activity of VEGF is tightly regulated by endogenous antiangiogenic mediators mainly produced by the degradation
of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as collagens and fibronectin.

Endostatin (ES), a proteolytic fragment of collagen type
XVIIL, was first described as a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis [23]. In addition to its well-known activity as
down-regulator of VEGF, ES has been recently proposed
as a new vasoactive mediator due to its direct effect on
endothelial cells [22]. Increased serum levels of ES have
been reported in autoimmune skin diseases, such as
scleroderma [8] and in skin cancer such as melanoma [12].
Up to now, no data on the role of ES in patients with CSU
are available.

Parallel to ES, Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a heparinbinding protein with anti-angiogenic activity stored in the
ECM, seems to play a crucial role in several stages of the
inflammatory response [13]. Its role in chronic inflammatory diseases is still controversial. In some cases, TSP-1
activates leukocytes, enhances chemotaxis, and accelerates
fibrosis. In others, it prevents injury and progressive
damage and enhances homeostasis [13]. An increased level
of TSP-1 has been detected in autoimmune diseases, such
as rheumatoid arthritis where it seems to exert proinflammatory effects [15, 19]. In chronic inflammatory skin
diseases, such as psoriasis, it is up-regulated in skin biopsies following immunosuppressive therapy with the antiTNF-a agent Etanercept [3]. Recently, it has been shown
that TSP-1 destabilizes contact between endothelial cells
due to its direct effect on the cells, suggesting a contribution to skin vasodilation and consequent extravasation in
CSU [9].

The aim of our study was to investigate the circulating
levels of ES and TSP-1 in patients with CSU, where
vasodilation is a crucial step for the development of wheals
and flare. In addition, we investigated the potential role of
these mediators in the setting of the disease.

Methods

We studied 106 CSU patients (64 female and 42 male; age
46 + 16, range 14-90) and 98 sex-matched and age-matched healthy subjects (NHS). CSU was diagnosed
according to the EAACI/GA*LEN/EDF guidelines [24].
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are
reported in Table 1.

Patients with chronic cholinergic and chronic inducible
urticaria as well patients with other concomitant diseases
were excluded from the study. All the patients were being
treated with non-sedating oral H1-antihistamines (40 % of
the patients were treated with desloratadine 5 mg/day,
30 % levocetirizine 5 mg/day, 10 % rupatadine 10 mg/

day, 20 % ebastine 10 mg/day), stopped 5 days before
serum samples were taken for ASST and for the detection
of ES and TSP-1. No patients received corticosteroids or
cyclosporine treatments. The study protocol conformed to
the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. All
the subjects studied gave their informed consent before
enrolment. Before starting H1-antihistamine therapy, disease activity was calculated according to the recent EAACI/GA7LEN/EDF guidelines [24], using the urticaria
activity score of seven consecutive days (UAS7) and subdivided into mild, moderate and severe urticaria. ASST
was performed as previously reported [11].

ES and TSP-1 concentrations were measured in the sera
of CSU and in the control group by sandwich enzyme
immunoassay (Duo-set, R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis,
MN, USA), according to manufacturer’s instructions, following sera dilution (1/200).

Results were expressed as median and interquartile ranges. The non-parametric Mann—Whitney U-test was used to
compare data between the patients’ group and the NHS. A
P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

According to the UAS classification, urticaria was mild in
36, moderate in 56 and severe in 14 patients. Among the
CSU patients, 43 (41 %) were positive and 63 (59 %)
negative to ASST. We analyzed the levels of ES in the sera
of patients with CSU and in control subjects. As shown in
Fig. la, the levels of ES were significantly higher in CSU
(3.8 ng/ml; range 1.12-5.50) when compared to the NHS
(0.76 ng/ml; range 0.43-2.28) (P < 0.0001). In CSU
patients, no significant difference between the ASSTpositive (3.68 ng/ml; range 1.19-5.90) and negative
(3.86 ng/ml; range 1.11-5.01) sub-groups has been
observed. Interestingly, the CSU patients with the highest
concentration of ES were all positive at the ASST. No
relation was detected between ES levels and disease
severity, according to the UAS7. Parallel to ES, the levels
of TSP-1 (Fig. 1b) was significantly increased in the sera of
CSU (74.3 ng/ml; range 54.0-92.9) as compared to NHS
(51.8 ng/ml; range 38.0-76.3) (P < 0.0001), without any
significant differences between ASST-negative and positive sub-groups. As observed for ES, the levels of TSP-1
did not parallel the severity of the urticaria.

Discussion
In this study, we showed for the first time that ES and TSP
1, products of ECM degradation, are increased in the sera
of CSU patients.

Mast cells are the main skin cells involved in the
pathogenesis of urticaria. An activation of these cells with
consequent degranulation seems to be responsible for
vasodilation in the skin [16]. The underlying causes of mast
cell activation in CSU are largely unknown and remain to
be identified. A sizable subgroup of CSU patients express
IgG auto-antibodies to IgE or to the a-subunit of the high
affinity IgE receptor, FceRI [6, 7], or IgE antibodies against
TPO [1]. However, the observation that a large part of CSU
has no auto-antibodies suggests that other circulating
mediators are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of
the disease. This is partially confirmed by several independent studies demonstrating an increase of inflammatory
mediators in CSU, such as IL-6 [4], IL-18 [17], IL-17, IL23, TNF-« [2]. The identification of biomarkers relevant
for follow-up and management of the disease remains an
important goal. Previously published results on potential
biomarkers are often contradictory and suffer a limited
correlation with disease activity [14]. This is probably due
to the low number of subjects evaluated, different criteria
for patient inclusion, different methodologies used and thus
difficulties in comparing data [14].

To have more reliable results, we have selected for the
present study, a large number of patients with CSU
according to the recent EAACI guidelines. In our study, all
the patients were evaluated when H1-antihistamine therapy
was stopped. The increase of ES and TSP-1 in the sera of
CSU patients suggests that these ECM fragments might be
involved in the pathogenesis of CSU. The functional
activity of ES has been linked for many years to its antiangiogenic activity by interference with the VEGF/VEGFR
binding [18]. However, a vasorelaxation activity of ES on
endothelial cells via NO synthesis has been described [22].
These data may suggest that ES might contribute to the

vascular leakage in the skin of patients with CSU, leading
to the development of its clinical features, such as wheals
and flare formation. ECM fragments are often the results of
the proteolytic activity of a wide variety of catalytic
enzymes released in the tissues by mast cells such as
Cathepsins and metalloproteases (MMPs) [5]. Thus, the
increase of ES in CSU might be the result of proteolytic
enzymes released from the activated skin mast cells. Following mast cell activation, MMPs are released in the
tissue and may induce ES formation from Collagen XVIII,
leading to vasorelaxation and amplification of inflammation. Parallel to ES, we have showed that TSP-1 is
increased in the sera of CSU patients, suggesting a potential role of this endogenous mediator in CSU. TSP-1 is
involved in angiogenesis, cancer and inflammation. It
regulates multiple cellular events involved in reparative
processes in the skin, including cell adhesion, migration,
ECM expression/organization and regulation of growth
factor activity [20]. Beside it well-known anti-angiogenic
activity, TSP-1 has the property to destabilize endothelial
cell contacts. This might contribute to vasodilation in the
skin, important step for the development of wheals and
flare during urticaria. On the other hand, a role of TSP-1 in
resolution of inflammation has been proposed. Under this
view, the increased levels of TSP-1 in CSU might represent
one of the mechanisms counteracting inflammation.
Comparing the levels of ES and TSP-1 in ASST-positive
and ASST-negative sub-groups, no significant differences
were detected, suggesting that in CSU an increase in circulating ES and TSP-1 levels might reflect the inflammatory process independently of the involvement of an
autoimmune response. Our results are in accordance with
our previous study on IL-18 [17] and with the data of
Kasperska-Zajac et al. [10] showing no differences in the

plasma levels of IL-6 between ASST-negative and positive
sub-groups.

When the potential relevance of ES and TSP-1 in the
clinical setting of the disease was investigated, no differences in ES and TSP-1 levels among mild, moderate and
severe CSU groups have been detected. These findings
indicate that the levels of these ECM fragments are not a
potential marker of urticaria activity, but probably an
epiphenomenon.

In conclusion, our results suggest the potential
involvement of ECM fragments with anti-angiogenic
activity in the pathogenesis of CSU. It remains to be
understood whether ES and TSP-1 up-regulation is a consequence of the inflammatory reaction or one of the causes
of the pathology.
