Abstract

Background: The non- or low-sedating H1 receptor antagonists represent the basic therapy for urticaria. Objective: To test an
alternative approach to patients unresponsive to conventional treatment. Materials and methods: A total of 22 patients with
chronic urticaria unresponsive to conventional antihistamine treatment were enrolled for this study. They had uncontrolled
urticaria even using multiple combinations of antihistamines on maximum doses and corticosteroids in short cycles
(prednisone 20-40 mg, per os once a day, 3-7 days per month). Cutaneous biopsies of the urticaria lesions were taken.
These findings were classified as: (I) a mixture of perivascular dermal inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes,
monocytes and neutrophils and/or eosinophils; (II) inflammatory infiltrate composed chiefly of neutrophils; and (IID)
inflammatory infiltrate composed mainly of eosinophils. According to histology, the patients were submitted to one of the
following therapeutic schemes: class A — antihistamine treatment plus dapsone; class B — colchicine or dapsone; class C —
montelukast. Results: Four patients in class A, 08 in class B and seven in class C displayed complete control of urticaria after
12 weeks of treatment; one patient in class B and two in class C did not respond to treatment. Two years after
discontinuation, 16 patients are still free of urticaria. Conclusions: This study suggests an alternative approach for treating
unresponsive chronic urticaria.

Introduction enough (1). Corticosteroid therapy with prednisone
or methylprednisolone can be introduced for a few
days if antihistamines do not control urticaria
symptoms or when a rapid therapeutic response is
needed (9). In cases of relapse after corticosteroid
withdrawal, some other therapeutic regimens can be
tried although with poor results (8,9). Because of
this, we tested an alternative approach in patients
with urticaria unresponsive to conventional treatment.

Urticaria has a broad range of clinical and histologic
features (1). Although mast cells are considered the
primary effector cells in urticaria, they appear to be
maximally increased in the recent fully developed
lesions of chronic urticaria (2,3). However, it has
been shown that the inflammatory infiltrate in
Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria (CIU) also includes
mononuclear cells, T lymphocytes and some other
cells such as neutrophils and eosinophils (2-4).
Some authors reported cell activation by cytokines,

leukotrienes and prostaglandins released by the mast
cells during the urticaria late phase reaction (5-8).
The non- or low-sedating H1 receptor antagonists, such as cetirizine, fexofenadine, loratadine,
and, more recently, ebastine, desloratadine and
levocetirizine, represent the basic therapy for chronic
urticaria (1). Older sedating antihistamines, such as
hydroxyzine, may be used if the itching is severe

Materials and methods

Twenty-two patients with chronic urticaria unresponsive to conventional antihistamine treatment
were enrolled in this study. They had uncontrolled
urticaria even using multiple combinations of antihistamines on maximum doses and oral corticosteroids in short cycles (prednisone 20-40 mg, per os

once a day, 3-7 days per month). They were
submitted to physical urticaria tests and to an
extensive clinic and laboratory evaluation to exclude
food and airborne allergenicity, drug exposure or
internal diseases. The age of the patients varied from
19 to 62 years old (mean 41.14+11.06), 16 were
females (72.72%) and six were males (27.28%).
Twelve patients were Caucasian (54.55%) and 10
were African-American (45.45%). The patients also
underwent cutaneous biopsies of the urticaria
lesions. The cutaneous biopsies were fixed in paraformaldehyde 4%, included in paraffin and were
stained with hematoxylin-eosin, under the conventional method. Three to five sections from each biopsy were examined at x 400 magnification, screening
sequentially adjacent fields in the upper and lower
dermis, as described by Toppe et al. (9). Graduation
of perivascular cell infiltration was established by
count using a high magnification field: neutrophilic
urticaria (= 7 neutrophils/10 cells in the perivascular
infiltrate); eosinophilic urticaria (= 7 eosinophils/10
cells in the perivascular infiltrate); and mixed
urticaria (presence of mononuclear neutrophils and
eosinophils, without a predominance of any cell type
in the perivascular infiltrate) (9,10).

The histopathologic findings were classified in
three groups: (I) a mixture of perivascular dermal
inflammatory infiltrate, made of lymphocytes,
monocytes and neutrophils and/or eosinophils; (ID
a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate composed
chiefly of neutrophils; and (III) a perivascular

inflammatory infiltrate composed mainly of eosinophils. According to histology, the patients were
submitted to one of the following therapeutic
schemes — class A: antihistamine treatment plus
dapsone 100 mg per os daily to one patient from
group I and three from group II; class B: colchicine
1.0 mg per os daily to nine patients from group II,
due to some contraindication for dapsone use; and
class C: montelukast 10 mg per os daily to nine
patients from group III (Table I).

At the beginning of the study, all the patients were
under antihistamine and corticosteroid treatment
(prednisone 40 mg per os daily for 5 days); later,
prednisone doses were decreased to 20 mg per os
daily and we added dapsone or colchicine or
montelukast as described above. After that, prednisone was decreased (10 mg down each 5 days)
and the treatment with dapsone or colchicine or
montelukast and the antihistamines was maintained. Subsequently, the antihistamines were taken
out and the patients remained on drugs above
mentioned.

The patients were evaluated every week in the first
month and monthly during a further 2 months. The
urticaria evaluation and number and degree of
lesions was graded using the score proposed by
Zuberbier et al. (11), and we considered that the
patient respond to the treatment when the score was
decreased down to 0 or 1.

At the end of this period the drugs were stopped.
According to the protocol the patients had their

blood analyzed every 2 weeks for a WBC count, as
well as for hepatic and renal function.

The statistical analysis considered all variables of
the study. We used the gui square test to verify the
association between the qualitative variables. We used
the Kolmogorov—Smirnov and Levene tests, respectively, to test the homogeneity and regularity of the
samples to the quantitative variables. If the sample
satisfied these two principles we used parametric tests
(paired t-test and analysis of variance). If it did not,
we used the Kruskal-Wallis test.

Results

The average length of urticaria duration before
starting the protocol was 42.45+53.26 months. In
six patients, the urticaria symptoms started after
exposure to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAID): two patients in group II and four in group
Ill. Two patients blamed food dyes as causative
agents of their urticaria and 14 did not report any
trigger event for initiating their disease (they were
classified as having chronic idiopathic urticaria).
Fourteen patients had angioedema associated to
urticaria lesions: one in group I, seven at group II
and six from group III. The average overall time of
response was 46.84+20.76 days. There were no
statistical differences between the responders and
non-responders for sex (p=0.295), ethnic group
(p=0.358), triggers (p=0.343), age (p=0.193), the
duration of disease before treatment (p=0.57),
score before treatment (p=0.158) or the kind of
inflammatory infiltrate (p=0.331).

The score of symptoms had a mean of 5.00+0.81
before treatment and 1.09+1.92 after treatment.
There was a statistical significance between the score
at the beginning of the treatment and after
(p<0.01) but there were no differences between
the groups I, II and III (p=0.331).

The time of response varied from 30 to 90 days
(mean: 46.84+20.76). Four class A patients, 11
class B and seven class C displayed complete control
of urticaria after treatment and one class B and two
class C patients did not respond to treatment
(Table I). Two years after discontinuation, 16

patients are still free of the disease. After 2 years of
follow-up, the disease relapsed in three patients (one
treated with colchicine, one with montelukast and
one with dapsone). These three patients restarted
the same treatment schedule and two are now free of
symptoms. We did not notice laboratory abnormalities or side effects in any patient.

Discussion

The standard treatment for chronic urticaria is the
oral administration of histamine-receptor antagonists. However, many patients are not sufficiently
controlled with such treatments (8). There are many
case reports and controlled studies based on clinical
status, score symptoms, and the presence or absence
of an autologous serum test (8) to treat patients
not responding to treatment with antihistamines.
This uncontrolled open study suggests an alternative approach to treat unresponsive chronic
urticaria based on the histopathologic features of
drug choice.

An inflammatory infiltrate composed of neutrophils, eosinophils or eosinophil products, activated
macrophages, and T-helper lymphocytes has already
been described in the lesions of chronic and
cholinergic urticaria and in deep pressure urticaria,
the last involving primarily the lower dermis (2,5,7).
The clinical importance of this is that there is a
subgroup of patients who show eosinophilic or
neutrophilic urticaria resistant to antihistaminic
treatment alone, but who respond to a combination
of antihistamine with other drugs. A skin biopsy
could help to classify urticaria in subgroups and it is
an alternative way to guide the choice of treatment
(2,5,7). To our knowledge, until now, there are few
reports making a correlation between the type of
inflammatory infiltrate and a given treatment regimen; however, we have not found another clinical
trial using a similar protocol based on histopathologic findings to treat urticaria unresponsive to
antihistamines (6).

Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist
used to treat asthma and urticaria (12). The results
with montelukast in urticaria were heterogeneous.
There are several reports showing that montelukast

might be effective for the treatment of autoimmune
urticaria and urticaria complicated by aspirin intolerance or food dye but show little or no effectiveness
for idiopathic urticaria (11-13). Recently, Goel and
Prasad (14) studied 25 patients with NSAIDinduced urticaria and showed that montelukast was
effective in 22 patients. Nevertheless, Sanada et al.
(15) showed that montelukast was more effective
than low doses of corticosteroids for patients with
chronic idiopathic urticaria. We used this drug to
treat eosinophilic urticaria because it has been
already reported that activated eosinophils induce
the synthesis of eicosanoid mediators generated from
arachidonic acid, such as leukotrienes (LT); particularly LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4, known as cysteinyl
leukotrienes (14,15). They may attract cells at the
inflammatory sites and amplify the inflammatory
response (16). In fact, we think that our success was
due to treatment with montelukast only in the
patients whose histopathologic findings showed
eosinophilic infiltrate.

Colchicine is an ancient drug, widely used in the
treatment of gout (17). This medication has found a
place in the treatment of several cutaneous diseases,
usually characterized by an accumulation of leukocytes in the skin, such as psoriasis, leukocytoclastic
vasculitis and urticaria vasculitis (18). It limits the
chemotactic and phagocytic activity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and also suppresses leukocyte
function by increasing the cytoplasmatic cyclic
adenosine monophosphate level and _ inhibiting
lysosomal degranulation (17,18). The increase in
the cyclic adenosine monophosphate level releases
prostaglandin E, which further suppresses leukocyte
function (18). Furthermore, Oka et al. (19) showed
that colchicine was a microtubule depolymerizer
crucial for mast cell degranulation. Therefore, the
inhibitory effects of colchicine on urticaria could
be due to a dual effect: (i) blocking neutrophil
chemotaxis and (ii) reducing mast cell degranulation. This drug has been used in some anecdotal
case reports of patients with urticaria vasculitis
(17-19).

Dapsone (4-4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone) is a sulfone derivative which exerts antimicrobial and antiinflammatory effects and has been used for more
than 60 years to treat a great variety of skin diseases
with neutrophilic dermal infiltrate such as urticaria
vasculitis, Beget’s disease, pioderma gangrenosum
and others (20,21). As for urticaria, dapsone, alone
or in combination with other drugs, is considered an
alternative therapeutic approach because of its
capacity in neutrophil inhibition (21). To produce
this effect, it has been postulated that dapsone
impairs neutrophil chemotaxis and inhibits the
function of neutrophils at the site of inflammation
(20). Anecdotal reports suggested the feasibility of
treatment with dapsone in CIU and delayed pressure
urticaria, in which favorable results were obtained in

Urticaria unresponsive to antihistaminic treatment 95

isolated cases or small study populations. Cassano
et al. (22) studied 11 patients with severe refractory
urticaria and obtained a complete response in nine
patients within 3 months of treatment.

Finally, we conclude that the clinical importance
of our study is based on the fact that in this subgroup
of patients, who show eosinophilic or neutrophilic
urticaria and are resistant to antihistaminic treatment alone, skin biopsy could help to classify
urticaria in histologic subgroups, as such patients
can be responders to antihistamine combined with
another drugs, such as colchicine or dapsone or
montelukast, and this is an alternative way to guide
treatment choice.
