Clinical Implications

e In patients with chronic refractory urticaria who do not
achieve improvement with the treatment recommended

in the international guidelines (antihistamines,

omalizumab OR cyclosporine), the combined use of
antihistamines, omalizumab AND cyclosporine, is a
useful and safe alternative to achieve clinical control.

 

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a disease with high
personal and social impact. Following the steps recommended in
international guidelines for pharmacological treatment (antihistamines, omalizumab or cyclosporine), ' most patients achieve
satisfactory control.” However, several studies show that between
10% and 30% of patients with CSU do not achieve adequate
control of symptoms despite the use of these therapies.’

Some treatments such as methotrexate, azathioprine, and
autologous serum have been used as alternative methods of
treatment in refractory patients. An increase in the monthly dose
of omalizumab has also been proposed.’ Although all these
measures have been shown to be effective in some patients, the
cost factor is substantially increased with the use of omalizumab
in high doses and the safety and efficacy of the other therapies
have been little studied in CSU.

Given that omalizumab and cyclosporine are 2 of the most
studied treatments for CSU, another alternative treatment could
be the use of both therapies at the same time. At the moment,
most of the guidelines recommend the use of these treatments in
a step-by-step sequence,' but there is little information on the
combined use of antihistamines, omalizumab and cyclosporine.’
Hypothetically, because both therapies have independent
mechanisms of action, it is possible that together they will achieve better clinical control. Although omalizumab and especially
cyclosporine may have recognized adverse effects,° it has been
observed that in patients with CSU, the frequency of side effects
is quite low at the dose of 200 mg per day for cyclosporine and
300 mg per month for omalizumab.’ In this cross-over
comparative study conducted in 2 allergy services from Medellin, Colombia, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of these
therapies in combination.

Over a period of 12 months, patients aged 18 years or older
and with uncontrolled urticaria (Weekly Urticaria Activity Score
[UAS7] > 14) despite use of high-dose anthistamines (x4 for at
least 2 months) and omalizumab (300 mg/mo) or cyclosporine
(3 mg/kg/d) for at least 4 months were recruited. Patients with
urticaria vasculitis, pregnancy and lactation, hepatitis, or renal
disease were excluded, as well as patients receiving other therapies
(eg, methotrexate) that could interfere with the evaluation of the
response to the intervention of interest.

 

 

 

The selection of starting with either cyclosporine or omalizumab was according to medical discretion. In patients without
clinical response (UAS7 <6) after receiving 1 of these added
therapies for at least 4 months, the other option was given
sequentially (eg, if the patient initially received omalizumab then
cyclosporine was offered) with a period of 2 months of washout
between each therapy. If after receiving the second immunomodulatory drug the patient had not reached a UAS7 of less than
6, both omalizumab and cyclosporine were coadministered for 6
months in addition to continued antihistamine therapy. The
overall study design is depicted in Figure 1.

All recruited patients signed an informed written consent
endorsed by the ethics committee. Of 458 patients with CSU
seen during the recruitment period, 126 patients had UAS7 of
more than 14 points after the use of antihistamines and 88
received omalizumab (48 patients) or cyclosporine (40 patients).
Twelve patients with omalizumab and 15 from the cyclosporine
group were still uncontrolled after 4 months according to UAS7;
5 patients who received omalizumab after cyclosporine and 1
who received cyclosporine after omalizumab achieved clinical
control with the added therapies.

The 21 patients who did not reach clinical control with the
use of each one of these therapies started the 2 therapies
together. After 4 months, 16 patients reached a UAS7 of less
than 6 points (Figure 2) and had no relapses during the followup period. Of the 63 patients who received omalizumab, 9
reported headaches and 6 cramps on the day of application;
however, none of them discontinued therapy. Of the 52 patients who received cyclosporine, 4 had a transient increase in
blood pressure and 6 had a 10% decrease in leukocytes; however, none of them presented serious adverse events that justified discontinuation of therapy. Among the 21 patients who
received the 2 therapies together, we did not observe a significant increase in the frequency of adverse events or the need to
suspend any of the therapies.

According to our results, the combined use of omaizumab
and cyclosporine seems to be a safe and effective step-up option
for those unable to achieve control with individual immunomodulatory therapy. Our study has the characteristics of a
cross-over study in that the evaluation of different interventions
was done in the same subject, and among its disadvantages is
that there may be an carryover effect that alters the evaluation
of each intervention. It is important to note that the effect of
omalizumab and cyclosporine can extend more than 2 months,
which was the time we gave for washout between each intervention. However, the clinical measures (UAS, Urticaria Control Test, Dermatology Life Quality Index) showed had no
significant variations at the beginning of each of these therapies
in any of the groups and the improvement among patients who
responded to the joint therapy was rapid. Therefore, we
consider that at least most of the clinical effect observed was
due to their joint use and not due to the residual effect of their
use separately.

 

The use of cyclosporine and omalizumab has more evidence
than any other therapy in the management of CSU, so their joint
use offers advantages over other therapies that although they may

than increasing the dosage of omalizumab and possibly more
effective if we compare our results with the percentage of control

In conclusion, our study suggests that the use of omalizumab
in tandem with cyclosporine could be an effective step-up therapy in patients with uncontrolled urticaria despite the addition of
an individual immunomodulator.
