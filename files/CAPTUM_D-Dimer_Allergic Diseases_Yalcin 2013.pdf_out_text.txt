Background: D-dimer (DD), a fibrin degradation product formed during the
lysis of athrombus, is also detected in high levels in patients with active chronic
urticaria (CU). Severe persistent allergic asthma (SPA) is associated with a
procoagulant state in the bronchoalveolar space, further aggravated by
impaired local activities of the anticoagulant protein C/protein S, antithrombin
Ill system and fibrinolysis. This was demonstrated as massive fibrin depositions
found in the alveoli of a SPA patient who died from a SPA attack and who did
not respond to treatment.

Objectives: For this reason, we investigated the effect of omalizumab both in
bronchial and systemic vascular areas and evaluated SPA (group |) and CU
(group Il) patients before and after therapy period.

Methods: Blood samples were taken before treatment (A), on 4th month (B),
on 8th month (C) and on 12th month (D) post treatment in both groups.
Results: We compared DD levels between groups: the significant DD difference
was observed between group-lA and group-IC (p = 0.031); between group-lA
and group-ID (p = 0.003); between group-IB and group-ID (p = 0.049) and
between group IIA-1 and group-IID (p = 0.015). In the IIA-1 group, there was a
significant positive correlation between DD and age (p = 0.008, r = 0.848).
Conclusion: |In conclusion, mediators and cells classically involved in procoagulant and anticoagulant pathways together play a role in SPA and CU
pathophysiology, where omalizumab has its effect.

1. Introduction

 

Omalizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the CH3 domain,
near the binding site for the high-affinity type-I immunoglobulin E (IgE) Fe receptors of human IgE, can neutralize free IgE and inhibit the IgE allergic pathway without sensitizing mast cell and basophils (1). Omalizumab has been approved in over
100 countries for treating patients with severe persistent allergic asthma. These
pharmaceutical developments have validated the IgE pathway as an effective therapeutic target for treating IgE-mediated allergic disease. More interestingly, as we
have observed in some of our cases, one severe persistent asthmatic (SPA) patient

e who had protein C (pC)/protein S (pS) deficiency history (who was also a heterozy| nfo r ma gous carrier of factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutation) and multiple
healthcare massive pulmonary embolus, systemic subacute thrombosis determined in vena

saphena parva and in left venae perforantes cruris, underwent omalizumab

treatment and after a long-term (20 months) treatment with
omalizumab, he had a decreased fractional exhaled nitric
oxide concentrations (FENO), d-dimer (DD), sTRAIL,
proinflammatory IL-1B and OX-2 and had an increased
CXCL8, activated pC (APC), antithrombin III (AIII), pS
and pC levels (2). In this patient’s blood, levels of APC,
AIll, pS and pC were found to be increased (74, 128,
102 and 86%, respectively), and DD level (412 U/l) was
found to be decreased at 30th month under omalizumab therapy and this result was significant. Tissue factor (TF) is the
main initiator of coagulation and is found exclusively in the
respiratory epithelium. Recent reports revealed that patients
with chronic urticaria (CU) show signs of thrombin generation and activation of the TF pathway of the coagulation system [3]. DD, a fibrin degradation product formed during the
lysis of a thrombus, is also detected in high levels in patients
with active CU [3,4). SPA is associated with a procoagulant

 

state in the bronchoalveolar space, further aggravated by
impaired local activities of the anticoagulant pC/pS, AIII system and fibrinolysis, as demonstrated by massive fibrin depositions in the alveoli of a SPA patient who died from a SPA
attack and who did not respond to treatment (2,5).

For considering the effect of omalizumab both in bronchial
and systemic vascular areas, we evaluated SPA (group I) and

CU (group II) patients before and after therapy period.

 

2. Materials and methods

 

2.1 Experimental procedures

All patients have been informed and consent was acquired for
this study. Group I consisted of SPA patients and group II
consisted of CU patients. Both groups were also divided
into four category: before treatment (A), 4th month (B), 8th
month (C) and 12th month (D) post treatment. This study
was also approved by the local ethics committee. DD plasma
level was measured by enzyme-linked fluorescence assay kits
(VIDAS® DD Exclusion II) from bioMérieux, France. The
cut-off level is 500 ng/ml. Total IgE levels were enumerated
by fluoroenzyme immunoassay (ImmunoCAP-FEIA) using
an ImmunoCAP (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) kit. The
data were presented as mean + SD.

2.2 Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were carried out using the SPSS 18.0
software (SPSS, Inc., New York, USA). Data were analyzed
for normality of distribution by using the KolmogorovSmirnoy test. Results of normally distributed data are expressed
as mean + SD. Comparison of parameters between the groups
was performed using independent-samples ¢test. Correlation
between variables was assessed by Pearson’s correlation
coefficient. A p-value < 0.05 indicated statistical significance.

2.3 Results
Group I: SPA, n = 20, asthma diagnosis years (ADY): 13.58 +
8.64, age (years): 45.37 + 12.32. Blood samples were taken

before treatment (group IA), on 4th month (group IB), on 8th
month (group IC) and on 12th month (group ID) post treatment. There were five patients with concomitant cardiovascular
disease and three patients with concomitant type 2 diabetes in
group I. Pulmonary function tests with the measurement of
FENO were performed on the same day. FENO were assessed
under the GINA guideline as an indicator of disease severity, el fFicacy of omalizumab therapy and airway inflammation [6]. We
observed that FENO concentration (mean + SD) level decreased
in the follow-up period (group-IA: 65.55 + 7.90, group-IB:
53.45 + 5.7, group-IC: 51.2 + 3.1, group-ID: 39.70 + 3.5). Total
gE level measurements were (mean + SD) as follows: group-IA:
987.6 + 386.5, group-IB: 939.6 + 353.7 and total IgE IC:
739.6 + 441.7, group-ID: 388.9 + 196.6. Group IA, using
desloratadine, inhalant forte doses steroid (Best Standard Care,
following the recommendations of GINA, included inhaled fluticasone 500 mg twice daily [b.i.d.], inhaled salmeterol 50 mg
b.i.d.), and daily 80 - 8 mg oral methyl-prednisolone, monteluast therapy. We compared DD levels between groups: the significant DD difference was observed between group-IA and
group-IC (p < 0.05, p = 0.031, respectively); between group[A and group-ID (p < 0.05, p = 0.003, respectively) and between
group-IB and group-ID (p < 0.05, p = 0.049, respectively). In
group IA, there was a significant positive correlation between
age and ADY (p = 0.043, r = 0.468, p < 0.05). In group-ID, there
was a significant positive correlation between DD and age
(p = 0.034, r = 0.488, p < 0.05) (Figure 1).

Group II: CU, n = 8, urticaria diagnosis years (UDY):
17.50 + 8.19, age (years): 47.50 + 10.04. There were two
patients with concomitant cardiovascular disease. We subgrouped these patients as group IIA-1, who had active general
 

 

ized urticarial plaques taking no medication. At the time of
blood sampling, autolog serum skin test and disease activity
assessment, all patients discontinued short-acting antihistamines for at least 4 days and long-acting antihistamines and
systemic corticosteroids for at least 10 days. Disease activity
was assessed by EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF activity score (7). Diagnosis score for all patients were severe. Total IgE level measurements were as follows (mean + SD): group IA-1: 757.9 +
156.7.9, group IIB: 457.3 + 63.2, group IIC: 428.3 +
71.8 and group IID: 238.9 + 96. Group IIA-2 consisted of
patients whose lesions were in passive stage. Patients were under
steroid (40 - 16 mg oral methyl-prednisolone) and desloratadine 2 x 2 medications. We observed that DD level decreased.
Omalizumab was given to groups IIB and IIC (225 - 375 mg)
and was gradually ceased and continued with desloratadine 1 x
1. Group IID patients were under omalizumab medication
only. The significant DD difference was observed between
group IIA-1 and group-IID (p < 0.05, p = 0.015, respectively).
In the ITA-1 group, there was a significant positive correlation
between DD and age (p = 0.008, r = 0.848, p < 0.005)
(Figure 2).

For IgE: The significant IgE level difference was observed
between group-IA and group-ID (p = 0.002, p < 0.005)
and between group IIA-1 and group IID (p = 0.021, p < 0.05).

3. Discussion

 

The biological effects of APC and pC can be divided into anticoagulant and cytoprotective effects [s]. In patients with SPA,
bronchoalveolar levels of APC decreased after a bronchial allergen challenge and were significantly lower than healthy controls
and APC:pC ratios were decreased in induced sputum of
patients with SPA, thus pointing to an imbalance between coagulation and the pC system [9]. Extrinsic pathway of coagulation
is activated in response to high level of circulatory IgE. Best
example of this purported relationship is the correlation

between higher TF expression and vasculitis degree that
has been seen in hyper IgE syndrome (HIES). One of the
complement component C%5a also activates extrinsic pathway
by increasing TF in a similar way, which was reported in
humans [10}. HIES is a heterogeneous group of immune disorders. It is characterized by very high concentrations of the
serum antibody IgE. Clinically, eczema-like rash, cold staphylococcal infection, severe lung infection are seen. An IgE level
> 2,000 IU/ml is often considered diagnostic, except in patients
younger than 6 months of age [11]. Several studies reported clinical improvement in patients with severe atopic eczema with
high serum IgE level [12). Additionally, the drugs other than
omalizumab that target JAK-STAT cascade or TH17 differentiation may be a potential successful treatment in HIES [13].
Severe staphylococcal infection seen in HIES patients may
reflects IgE impacts on ongoing proinflammatory state. The
activation of extrinsic pathway by TF then generates thrombin,
which leads to DD formation (3). We think that anti-IgE treatment with omalizumab inhibited activation of extrinsic pathway
and lowered DD levels by blocking free IgE. Because of this, we
think that omalizumab has a similar effect with heparin. After
the injection of heparin, an increase in the percentage of
pC/pS has been observed.

Besides its anticoagulant properties, heparin possesses a
wide range of anti-inflammatory activities, including inhibition of proinflammatory mediators, such as eosinophil
cationic peptid (ECP), peroxidase, neutrophil elastase and
inhibition of lymphocyte activation [14]. Anticoagulant treatment with heparin and warfarin had been attempted to reduce
the symptoms of CU and SPA; however, inhaled heparin is no
longer used in clinical practice as adjunctive therapy for SPA
attacks because of equivocal results (3-5).

Our knowledge concerning the use of omalizumab in treatment of SPA and other allergic diseases has improved our understanding that treatment acts on many levels, including affecting
levels of oxidative stress markers (copper-containing 0-2-glycorotein, total antioxidant capacity, hydrogen peroxide, malondialdehyde, total nitric oxide concentrations), and regulating
levels of inflammatory proteins, including TH1-2 cytokines,
PT, PTT, INR, MPV, platelet count, Hs-CRP, ECP,
vitamin-D and albumin (2,15-17). After omalizumab therapy, significant decrease in the levels of DD observed in our study
shows the importance of procoagulant state in allergic patients.
ngroup-IA, group IIA and group IIA-2, there were a significant
positive correlation between DD and IgE. We suggest that DD
may have an important role in the relationship between IgE
and extrinsic pathway of coagulation, that is, endothelial cells.

In conclusion, mediators and cells classically involved in procoagulant and anticoagulant pathways together play a role in
SPA and CU pathophysiology where omalizumab has its effect.
