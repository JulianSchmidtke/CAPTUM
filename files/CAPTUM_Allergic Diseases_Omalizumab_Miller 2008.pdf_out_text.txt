Abstract

 

Atopic diseases and asthma are increasing at a remarkable rate on a gobd scale. It is now well
recognized that asthmais a chronic inflanmatory disease of the airways. The inflammatory process
in many patients is driven by an immunoglobulin E(IgE)-dependent process. Mast cell activation and
release of mediators, in response to allergen and IgE, results in a cascade response, culminating in
B lymphocyte, T lymphocyte, eosinophil, fibroblast, smooth muscle cell and endothelial activation.
This complex cellular interaction, release of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors and
inflanmatory remodeling of the airways leads to chronic asthma. A subset of patients develops
severe airway disease which can be extremely morbid and even fata. While many treatments are
available for asthma, it is still a chronic and incurable disease, characterized by exacerbation,
hospitalizations and associated adverse effects of medications. Omalizumab is a new option for
chronic asthma that acts by binding to and inhibiting the effects of IgE, thereby interfering with one
aspect of the asthma cascade reviewed earlier. This is a humanized monoclonal antibody against IgE
that has been shown to have many beneficial effects in asthma Use of omaizumab may be
influenced by the cost of the medication and some reported adverse effects including the rare
possibility of anaphylaxis. When used in selected and carefully, omalizumab provides a very
important tool in disease management. It has been shown to have additional effects in urticaria,
angioedema, latex allergy and food allergy, but the datais limited and the indications far from clear.
In addition to decreasing exacerbations, it has a steroid sparing role and hence may decrease
adverse effects in some patients on high-dose gucocorticoids. Sudies have shown improvement in
quality of life measures in asthma following the administration of omaizumab, but the effects on
pulmonary function are surprisingy small, suggesting a disconnect between pulmonary function,
exacerbations and quality of life. Anaphylaxis may occur rarely with this agent and appropriate
precautions have been recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As currently
practiced and as suggested by the new asthma guidelines, this biologcal agent is indicated in

moderate or severe persistent allergic asthma (steps 5 and 6).

Introduction

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease characterized by infiltration of the mucosa by inflammatory
cells, mucus hypersecretion, subbasement membrane
fibrosis, snooth muscle hypertrophy, epithelial loss and
alterations of angiogenesis[1]. The result of these changes
is airway obstruction, a cumulative effect of airway
inflammation and remodeling changes. These various
definitions are summarized in Table 1. Inflammatory
processes that occur in asthma are summarized in Table 2.
Several inflammatory events occur in asthma, resulting in
the observed pathophysiological (Figure 1) and clinical
effects [1-3]. Th2-type T cells secreting a distinctive set of
cytokines [such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13] play
apivotal rolein asthma. We and others have showed that
IL-5 transcripts are detectable in the lungs of patients with
asthma, dominantly derived from the T cell fraction [4,5].
IL-5 is pivotal to eosinophil activation and survival. The
basic driving processin allergic asthmais the class switching to and secretion of IgE by Blymphocytes, in response
to cytokines such as IL-4. This defines the atopic phenotype. IgE to environmental allergens (referred to as specific antibody) binds to the respective allergen with high
affinity. The allergen interacts with IgE on the surface of
human mast cells, and mediates signaling via the high
affinity IgE receptor (FceR1) (Figure 1). FceR1 aggregation
is followed by mast cell activation and degranulation.
Mast cells release a plethora of mediators (Figures 1 and 2
and Table 1) which can, in turn, regulate eosinophil acti

vation [6,7], Th2 skewing and B cell class switching to IgE
[8,9]. Mast cells can also be activated by IgE-independent
mechanisms such as bacterial infection [10], toll-like
receptors, IL-1 [11] and by contact with either T cells [12]
or fibroblasts [13]. |gE-mediated inflammatory responses
may be responsible for a variety of atopic disorders,
including rhinitis, asthma, eczema, food allergy, otitis
media, anaphylaxis and asthma. Figure 2 demonstrates
the pivotal position of IgE and mast cellsin the initiation
of the asthma inflammatory cascade. Mast cells (1) can
interact with B cells (2) which can both interact with Th2
type T cells (3), an interaction mediated by cell surface
cognate molecules and resulting in IgE class switching in
B cells and cytokine expression. This can lead to endothelial activation (4), allowing the emigration of activated
eosinophils (5) into airway tissue. Eosinophil-derived
products (including major basic protein, cytokines, chemokines, and leukotrienes) can influence airway remodeling by inducing changes in airway cells (6) such as
epithelium, fibroblasts and smooth muscles. Airway
inflammation and airway remodeling together result in
airway obstruction, which manifests clinically as dyspnea
and wheezing.

The dominant mechanism of mast cell activation remains
by IgE-antigen-FceR1 interactions. Hence, inhibition of
this pathway is likely to modulate an early phase of allergicinflammation. This concept led to the development of
an anti-IgE antibody (omalizumab) asatreatment option

structure and clinical use of omalizumab.

The problem

On the one hand, we are seeing an alarming increase in
asthma incidence, severity and mortality. On the other, in
spite of major advancesin therapies, new delivery devices
and improved potency of medications (inhaled steroids,
long acting beta-adrenergic agonists/LABA, combination
medications, leukotriene antagonists), asthma is still a
chronic and incurable disease. The major morbidity of
asthma is associated with frequent exacerbations, emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and complications
associated with some of the therapies. Moreover, a significant number of cases are poorly controlled despite combination therapy with high doses of inhaled
corticosteroids and long-acting fB-agonists, leukotriene
antagonists and allergy immunotherapy. The GOAL study
demonstrated that 38-53% of patients using "optimal
therapy" continued to have poorly controlled disease
[14]. This suggests a need for alternative strategies and
agents. Such patients have additional comorbid problems
such as esophageal reflux, chronic sinusitis or severe sensitivity to indoor inhalant allergensor pollutants, but continue to be symptomatic even when these factors are
evaluated and treated. Moreover, the risk for dying in
patients with severe asthma is fairly high, with a 6-fold
increased risk for dying 3 years after hospital discharge.
The new guidelines suggest that such patients with moderate or severe persistent asthma (step 5 or 6) may be candidates for the use of omalizumab.

Omalizumab: historical and molecular aspects
Theciinical applicability of anti-lgE products was conceptualized over 15 years ago [15-17], with anumber of subsequent trials demonstrating their safety in several allergic
conditions [18]. The idea for use in humans stemmed
from the development of amurine monoclonal antibody
termed MAE11, shown to block theinteraction of IgE with
basophilsor mast cells without leading to cross-linking or
degranulation. Multiple attempts were made to humanize
this antibody and it was version 25 of these experiments
which rendered a product with a profile similar to that of
MAE11 [19]. This recombinant humanized monoclonal
antibody was termed rhuMAb-E25, alternative names
including IgE 025, omalizumab, and Xolair™ (which is
how it is currently being marketed by Genentech/
Novartis, South San Francisco, CA, and Tanox, Inc., Houston, TX). It consists of 95% human IgG, and 5% murine
IgG [20], a framework which reduced the potential for
immunogenicity [16,21]. Omalizumab targets the Ce3
epitope on the fragment of IgE which bindsthe« chain of
the high-affinity trimericthe IgE receptor (Figure 3), thus
blocking the binding of IgE with its receptor [22].

Omalizumab pharmacokinetics

Omalizumab is usually administered via the subcutaneousroute, after which it will havea bioavailability of 62%
and reach its peak serum concentration within seven to
eight days[23]. Omalizumab hasalong half-life (19 to 22
days), in part due to the sow removal by the hepatic reticuloendothelial system conferred by the lgG, portion [24].
Availability of IgE and the receptor to which it is bound
(low- or high-affinity) dictate the clinical effects of anti

IgE therapy, explaining a potential delay of weeks before
any appreciable activity isnoted [25]. The efficacy of omalizumab does not appear to differ when given subcutaneously or intravenously [26], with both routes causing a
dramatic decrease in IgE levels. In spite of this, there may
bemoreto explaining the mechanismsof omalizumab, as
very few IgE molecules on a mast cell or basophil are
required to cause sensitization [27]. With regards to other
potential formsof administering the product, the study by
Fahy et al. utilizing aerosolized E25 in allergic patients
failed to demonstrate a significant decrease in serum IgE

levels or any appreciable advantage over placebo in ameliorating early phase response, despite reporting the presence of anti-lgE in blood [28]. In addition, it appears this
route is more immunogenic, aslgG and IgA antibodies to
E25 were detected in one patient.

Molecular structure and interactions with IgE

Omalizumab acts by selectively binding free IgE molecules (Figure 3), consequently disabling their interaction
with the heavy chain FceRI [29]. With IgE-mediated antigen cross-linking being inhibited, there will be no activa

tion of mast cells or basophils [30]. This mechanism is
made possible by the spatial arrangement of the Fc of IgE,
composed of two heavy chains with binding sites for
FeeRI, FeeRII (CD23), and anti-IgE symmetrically positioned along acentral rotational axis through itstwo CH3
domains [31]. These three binding sites happen to be situated in an overlapping manner, hence occupation of one
of these sites precludes any of the other two from additional interactions due to conformational changes
[32,33]. Also, when there is binding of FceRI to one CH3
domain, this inhibits anti-IlgE from interacting with its

antigenic site on the other CH3 domain. Interestingly,
there may be attachment of anti-lgE to both CH3
domains, probably because this interaction does not lead
to a significant changein conformation [31].

The affinity of anti-IgE for IgE is about 10-19 M, which is
comparable to that between FceRI and IgE [31,34]. Omalizumab leads to a reversible decrease in the unbound
serum IgE of 84-99% within approximately 1 hour, with
low levels lasting 4—6 weeks after a single subcutaneous
injection [23,35]. This is extremely significant, as expres

sion of FceRI is directly influenced by IgE levels, with the
use of omalizumab down-regulating this receptor on the
surface of basophils, dendritic cells (types 1 and 2), and
skin mast cells (at a slower rate) [21,36-38]. This effect on
dendritic cells will consequently disturb normal |gE-facilitated presentation of antigens to T cells. The use of omalizumab will cause a progressive dissociation of IgE from
basophils extending over 3-4 weeks [39]. As FceRI
becomes free from IgE on the surface of mast cells and
basophils, the receptors will suffer engulfment and degradation, with a similar process occurring to the newlyformed FceRI molecules which never interact with IgE
[31]. These events result in desensitization of both mast
cells and basophils, leading to a much higher antigenic
requirement to trigger an atopic reaction [37,40].

As mentioned, omalizumab is nonimmunogenic thanks
to a specific property inherent to the product, which isa
lack of interaction with IgE molecules already complexed
with FceRI or FceRII, avoiding histamine release and
potential anaphylactic reactions [16,31]. Anti-lgE does
however interact with mlgE (membrane-bound IgE) on
the surface of B cells which express this molecule, with
subsequent cell lysis or inhibition [31].

Asthe IgE molecules become free from FceRI, they will be
bound by anti-lgE molecules circulating close by, forming
immune complexes (Figure 3) which will provide additional protection by attaching to new incoming allergens
and impede their binding to other FceRI molecules

[18,31]. The omalizumab-lgE immune complexes have
not been shown to cause tissue damage or to fix complement, mainly due to their small size (the molecular
weight islessthan 1,000 kDa) and to the fact that thereis
very little accumulation of the complexes (the main route
of excretion isurinary), even in the face of very high levels
of IgE [19,41]. There may be local accumulation of
immunecomplexesin the extravascular space (such asthe
mucosal epithelial lining), as anti-IlgE can cross capillaries
but is not able to return once complexed with IgE, and
may therefore contribute to local protection against allergens [31]. The level of total IgE is actually elevated during
use of omalizumab (as this assay includes the IgE-omalizumab complexes, which are cleared at a slower rate than
IgE), while in reality free IgE is decreased [42].

Molecular and clinical effects

As shown in Table 3, use of omalizumab has been evaluated in several allergic conditions, including allergic rhinitis, asthma, Churg-Strauss syndrome, atopic eczema,
urticaria, angioedema, latex allergy, and concurrently with
allergy immunotherapy to try to blunt reactions. While
approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
asthma, the other indications need to be studied further.
These will be reviewed later.

One of the main focus points of recent trials has been the
use of omalizumab in asthma. Table 4 lists the molecular
and clinical effects of omalizumab in asthma. Researchers
have analyzed both direct and indirect effects of the biological agent. Direct effects include decreased free level of
IgE and decreased FcsRI expression on mast cells and
basophils. Indirect effects are probably mediated by
effects of mast cell activation and IgE regulation. These
include decreased tissue levels of eosinophils, mast cells,
T cells and B cells [43]. Omalizumab has been postulated
to havea mast cell "stabilizing" effect [29].

growth factor, nitric oxide), omalizumab significantly
affects both early and late phases of asthma [23,44],
diminishing the frequency of exacerbations and the need
for inhaled steroids [45,46]. The late phase response is
dependent on the influx and activation of granulocytes,
and omalizumab acts by decreasing the number of eosinophils in soutum, blood, and nasal mucosa, achieved
through inhibition of IL-5 secretion by mast cells and
basophils and by directly inducing apoptosis of eosinophils [25,47-50]. Another beneficial effect is the
decrease in airway responsiveness to adenosine 5'-monophosphate (a marker of airway inflammation in allergic
asthma) seen with omalizumab use [51]. It needs to be
understood that the early and late phase responses are
experimental constructs and efficacy in these responses
may not necessarily represent improvement in clinical
asthma, which is best determined by improvements in
quality of life measures, lung function, peak expiratory
flow rates, and hospitalization or medication use. Nevertheless, the early and late phase responses provide one
measure of studying drug efficacy in airway inflammatory
disease.

The clinical effects on asthma are summarized in Table 4
and includeimproved asthma scores, decreased exacerbations, decreased steroid use, improved peak flows,
decreased hospitalizations, and improved asthma control
[52,53]. Several studies have demonstrated that adminis
tration of omalizumab is associated with a decreased incidence of exacerbations in asthma. Selected studies and
reviews are listed in Table 3. Milgrom and colleagues evaluated high- and low-dose omalizumab (rhuMAbE25) ina
placebo-controlled study of patients with asthma requiring inhaled or oral corticosteroids [54]. After a 4-week
run-in period, 317 patients were randomly assigned to
receive either placebo or high-dose (5.8 ywg/Kg body
weight per nanogram of IgE) or low-dose omalizumab
(2.5 pg/Kg per nanogram of IgE) administered intravenously. For the first 12 weeks of the study, subjects were
allowed to continue their regular doses of corticosteroids,
whilein the subsequent 8 weeks, the doses of corticosteroids were tapered, in an attempt to discontinue therapy.
The investigators demonstrated lower asthma symptom
scores in the treatment groups. More subjects in the antiIgE group were able to lower dosesor completely come off
corticosteroids [54]. The INNOVATE study [46] was a
double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group study of
patients with asthma in which patients were randomized
to receive omalizumab or placebo for 28 weeks. At the end
of the 28 weeks, patients receiving omalizumab had a
26% reduction in clinically significant exacerbations, 50%
reduction in numbers of severe exacerbations and a 44%
reduction in emergency room visits[46] compared to placebo. The omalizumab-treated patients also experienced
less hospitalizations, improved asthma scores, and greater
improvements in peak expiratory flows and pulmonary

functions. Such effects on exacerbations were also
observed in several other studies of severe or moderatesevere persistent asthma [55-65]. In a meta-analysis, Holgate [65] demonstrated that omalizumab administration
in severe asthma halved the rate of exacerbations and
improved quality of life parameters.

Effects of omalizumab in non-asthma conditions
The use of omalizumab has been successful in patients
with both perennial [66] and seasonal rhinitis [26,67], in
addition to a demonstrable benefit in patients with both
allergic rhinitis and asthma [68]. The documented advantages include an improvement in overall quality of life, a
decrease in the use of rescue antihistamine therapy, and
fewer nasal symptoms[69]. The one caveat with regardsto
seasonal rhinitis is that the efficacy of omalizumab has
only been shown to occur with doses capable of suppressing lgE levels to < 25 ng/ml [26,35,67].

A trial conducted with another monoclonal anti-IlgE
(TNX-901) reported an increase in the threshold for peanut sensitivity, signifying a potentially protective effect
against severe adverse reactions deriving from unintentional ingestion [70]. A phase II trial with similar characteristics was initiated with omalizumab but put to a halt
owing to reports of serious reactions to peanut flour in
some patients before they received omalizumab [71]. Irrespective of this setback, further studies are planned for the
near future [72].

Omalizumab has been used with a positive outcome in
several small studies of urticaria. In the skin, omalizumab
has a predominant influence on the late phase response,
mainly due to the more rapid uncoupling of IgE from its
low-affinity CD23 receptors (directly involved in the late
phase) when compared to the high-affinity FceRI [73].
Many studies have highlighted the positive effect of omalizumab on atopic dermatitis, especially in patients with

moderately elevated IgE levels [74-76], but at least one
study has documented failure of this treatment (the
patients had very high levels of IgE) [77]. Despite this, IgE
levels did not factor in the efficacy of omalizumab in
patients with chronic urticaria, with a positive outcome
observed with levels ranging from low to very high [78].
In addition, other studies have demonstrated a positive
effect in alleviating symptoms in patients with latex
allergy and in the treatment of cold-induced urticaria
[79,80].

Omalizumab: adverse events and safety

Tables 5 and 6 summarize the adverse effects seen to date
with omalizumab. Of these, three events are probably
important and need to be discussed. Local reactions occur
fairly frequently in patients receiving omalizumab injections. These usually manifest as bruising, warmth, erythema, swelling, urticarialike eruption. The local
reactions are sometimes severe (in up to 12% injections).
Anaphylaxis can occur in about 0.1% of injections. As
reviewed by the American Academy Of Allergy, Asthma
and Immunology and the American College of Allergy,
Asthma and Immunology Joint Task Force Report [81], 35
patients had 41 episodes of anaphylaxis associated with
omalizumab, corresponding to an anaphylaxis-reporting
rate of 0.09% of patients. Of these 36 events for which
time of reaction was known, 22 (61%) of the reactions
occurred in the first 2 hours after injection, usually after
one of the first three doses. The Task Force concluded that

an observation time of 2 hoursfor thefirst threeinjections

reactions[81]. That still leaves 25% of reactionsthat could

provision of an epinephrine auto—injector and closemonitoring should be effective in averting or treating anaphylaxis, should that occur. Anaphylaxis management is
discussed in Table 7 and administration of Epipen auto—

showed a small increase in the numbers of malignancies
in the treated individuals. Out of 4127 omalizumabtreated patients, 20 cases of malignancy appeared. These

included breast, prostate, melanoma, and parotid tumors.

One case of lymphoma was recorded. Initial data suggested that these malignancies occurred in 0.5% of omalizumab-treated patients compared to 0.2% of controls. A
later review of that data by an independent review group
and comparisons with the SEER database of cancer incidence suggested that the incidence with omalizumab was
no different from that of the general population. Currently under way is the EXCEL trial, along-term prospective study which addresses the specific issue of the risk of
cancer associated with omalizumab therapy.

Interestingly, no cases of serum sickness or anti-omalizumab monoclonal antibodies have been recorded to date,
although Dreyfuss and Randolph described one case of
anaphylactoid reaction to omalizumab which evolved
later into a serum sickness-like syndrome after pretreatment with a nonsteroidal agent [82]. This required discontinuation of the medication. Omalizumab is
pregnancy category B and is excreted in milk (Table 6).

Insurance and reimbursement issues

The use of omalizumab was first approved in the United
States in 2003 and in Europe in 2005 [30]. In the U.S,
Apart from certain particularities which may vary according to region, most issues (i.e. reimbursement, preauthorization, continued coverage) have been standardized [83].
Insurance companies may differ with regards to copayment and deductible specifications.

In order for a prescription of omalizumab to be filled, a
participating specialty pharmacy will require a" statement
of medical necessity" (SVN). This document will include
the diagnosis of allergic asthma, a list of current medications, the patient'sserum IgE level, and the positive results
of the allergy testing performed. The pharmacy will then
proceed to contact the patient's insurance company and
determine if coverage is provided.

In the event of aclaim denial, Genentech has set up a Single Point of Contact (SPOC) program which offers services such as benefit investigations and appeals assistance
free of charge, apart from assisting patients in obtaining
reimbursement for their products. If the patient does not
have insurance or has been rejected for insurance and
meets certain financial criteria, this program may provide
medications free or at a reduced rate.

Even when approval for omalizumab use is given, it is
usually only for a period of six months. Most insurance
companies will then require a "recertification of continued use" to establish if the medication is truly providing
any benefit. Documentation must be provided by the physician that there has been an improvement in symptoms
or areduced frequency of exacerbations, usually at six and
twelve months after omalizumab has been started. The
physician may also opt to document improvement via
pulmonary function testing. Of note, the efficacy of omalizumab is determined after aminimum treatment period
of twelve weeks, due to the delay in onset (as specified
above).

Indications for omalizumab

Some criteria for approval of use that have become virtually universal across insurance plans include: (1) a diagnosisof moderate to severe persistent asthma, (2) age> 12
years, (3) serum IgE levels between 30 and 700 IU/ml,
and (4) a positive skin test or blood test (such as radioallergosorbent test — RAST) for at least one perennial aeroallergen. The recent asthma guidelines [1] recommend the
use of omalizumab for moderate to severe persistent
asthma (steps 5 and 6) specifically.

Additional criteria, such as need for pre-bronchodilator
FEV1 within the past six months, negative current smoking status, use of high-dose inhaled steroids for at least six
weeks (usually in association with a long-acting bronchodilator and leukotriene modifier), and presence of
active symptoms (i.e. daily use of bronchodilators/constant need for rescue therapy, asthma-related hospitaliza
tion within the past twelve months) have been variably
used.

It is important to note that omalizumab will not be
approved for treatment of asthma exacerbations (acute
bronchospasm or status asthmaticus). Allergic rhinitis is
not considered an indication for omalizumab use and will
not usually be covered by insurance carriers. However,
when used in patients with asthma and concurrent rhinitis, omalizumab is likely to be effective in controlling
upper airway symptoms. Omalizumab is currently
approved for use in adults and children over 12 years of
age; studies are ongoing for children under the age of 12.

The acceptable codes for reimbursement (according to the
Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Disease — ICD-9) are 493.00, 493.1, 493.9. The current procedural terminology (CPT) code for omalizumab use is
90772 and can be billed for each given injection. The CPT
codes for percutaneous skin testing are 95024, 95028,
95004. In addition to the CPT code, thereisa Jcode applicable for omalizumab, which is 2357, utilized when the
medication is given in the office setting. The HCPC code
for therapeutic, prophylactic, or diagnostic injections of
omalizumab is 90772. HCPC codes describing chemotherapy injections are not to be used.

Omalizumab dosing and duration of therapy

Omalizumab dose is calculated based on the patient's
baseline serum IgE and the patient's body weight. The
decision on the dose and frequency of administration can
be made using the standardized tables (Tables 8 and 9).
The dosage of omalizumab chosen is calculated to result
in neutralization of free IgE to levels < 5% at baseline
(0.016 mg/kg of omalizumab per IU/mL per 4 weeks).
The total IgE may actually increase secondary to formation of omalizumab-IgE complexes and hence the IgE levelsshould not be measured after treatment initiation. The
patient needs to understand that this is along-term therapy, administered subcutaneously every 2 or 4 weeks
depending on body weight and baseline IgE level [83].

* See Table 7 for further details on dosing.

Each vial of omalizumab contains 150 mg of the drug.
After reconstitution with 1.4 mL of sterile water for injection, the vial will contain 150 mg of omalizumab in 1.2
mL of liquid. Swirling is necessary to accomplish complete solution of the medication, which is then administered subcutaneously. Two caveats about administration
exist, namely that the total dose cannot exceed 375 mg
and the dose/single injection should not exceed 150 mg,
resulting in the need sometimes for multiple injections.
Observation for anaphylactic events is required as discussed under the adverse events section. The cost per vial
of omalizumab is $470, and depending on dosages, the
cost/year may vary between $6000 and $36000 [83]. A
recent study by Wu et al. assessed the cost-effectiveness of
omalizumab in the treatment of asthmatic patients [84].
They found that the costs amount to $821,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and $120 for each symptomfree day gained. They go on to conclude that omalizumab
therapy is only cost-effective in seriously ill asthmatics
failing to achieve adequate control with other treatment
modalities.

Conclusion

There are several unmet needsin asthma. Severe asthmais
a difficult disease to control and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Omalizumab, a humanized monocional antibody, hasbeen shown to beeffective
in difficult-to-control asthma. Further studies are required
to determine which patients may most benefit from omalizumab.
