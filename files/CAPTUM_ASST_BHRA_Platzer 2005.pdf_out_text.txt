Validation of basophil histamine release against the autologous
serum skin test and outcome of serum-induced basophil histamine
release studies in a large population of chronic urticaria patients

Background: Endogenous histamine-releasing factors (HRFs) are involved in 30—
60% of patients with chronic urticaria (CU). Evidence for their existence comes
from in vivo studies of autoreactivity with the autologous serum skin test
(ASST), in vitro immunoassays demonstrating autoantibodies against the
immunoglobulin E (IgE) or the high affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) and seruminduced histamine release (HR) from basophils and mast cells. We have examined the correlation between the ASST and a new basophil histamine-releasing
assay (the HR-Urtikaria test) in a group of well-characterized CU patients and
subsequently determined the frequency of HR-Urticaria-positive sera from a
larger population of CU patients.

Subjects: Group | consisted of 28 patients with CU (16 were ASST-positive)
20 patients with atopic dermatitis, 24 patients with allergy to birch and nine
healthy controls. Group 2 consisted of 873 unselected CU patients.

Methods: White blood cells containing 1-2% basophils from a healthy nonatopic
donor were incubated with patients sera in the presence of interleukin (IL)-3.
Histamine was measured by the glass fibre method.
Results: Using the ASST as the true outcome, the HR-Urticaria test showed a
sensitivity and specificity of 75% in group | using a cut-off value for HR of

> 16.5%. None of the controls was positive in the HR-Urticaria test. In group 2,
we found no difference in the frequency of positives between male (34.6%,

n = 254) and female adults (35.1%, n = 576) but twice as many females as males
were tested.
Conclusions: Our studies have shown that the HR-Urticaria test has a good
sensitivity and specificity for endogenous HRFs demonstrated by the ASST
in patients with CU and that about one-third of unselected patients with CU
have a positive result.

Approximately 30-60% of patients with idiopathic
spontaneous chronic urticaria (CU) (1) react with a
wheal-and-flare response to intradermally injected autologous serum (2), indicating the presence of histaminereleasing factors (HRF) in blood (3, 4). Only about 50%
of CU patients with a positive autologous serum skin test
(ASST) seem to have functional autoantibodies on
basophil assays.

have

patients with suspected CU should be investigated with
the ASST and that those with a positive ASST result
should be confirmed by basophil histamine release (HR)

With the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) systems (7, 8) autoantibodies against FceRI

dermatitis, dermatomyositis, pemphigus vulgaris, bullous

The understanding that CU may be caused by endogenous vasoactive factors, including autoantibodies, is
important for patients with severe disease as their
reduction in quality of life has been compared with that
of patients awaiting coronary by-pass surgery (5). An
early diagnosis of autoimmune urticaria should optimize
the care of these patients and improve the outcome of
their disease. Bindslev-Jensen et al. (6) recommended that

pemphigoid, angio-oedema, urticarial vasculitis, and
healthy controls (HC) but only in CU patients do they
seem to be functional by means of ASST and HR from
basophils or mast cells. Furthermore, there is strong
evidence to suggest that the basophil is involved in CU.
Both the capability of basophils to release histamine in
response to immunological stimuli and the absolute
number of basophils in peripheral blood from patients

 
with CU are decreased when compared with HC (9). The
CU patients with functional autoantibodies are found to
have more severe systemic symptoms and larger wheals
than the patients without autoantibodies (10) and a
longer duration of disease (11).

We have compared a standardized laboratory test
using basophils for HR against the ASST as a ‘gold
standard’ of endogenous histamine-releasing activity, in
contrast to previously published reports of the ASST
being compared against functional autoantibodies
defined by in vitro HR studies on basophils, because a
low-molecular weight nonautoantibody ‘mast cell-specific
factor’ may be present in the serum of some CU patients
(12, 13) who have negative basophil HR assays. Although
the ASST appears to be a clinically useful marker of
endogenous vasoactive factors, including autoantibodies,
which are relevant to understanding urticaria pathogenesis and its treatment it is time-consuming and not
accessible to all clinicians.

The aim of this work has been to standardize an in vitro
basophil assay for use in the diagnosis of autoimmune
urticaria and investigate the frequency of positive results
in a group of patients with unselected CU.

Material and methods
Patients

Group 1. Sera from a small group of CU patients presenting with
the ordinary pattern of disease (n = 28) were examined initially for
histamine-releasing activity. An ASST was positive in 16 of them.
An additional group of sera from nine HC, 20 patients with atopic
dermatitis and 24 patients with allergy to birch (no ASST
performed) were tested with the HR-Urticaria test as well. All sera
in the initial study group were submitted to the laboratory blinded
with respect to diagnosis and outcome of the ASST.

Group 2. Sera from 873 unselected consecutive patients presenting
to specialist clinics with CU were tested for serum-induced HR in
the HR-Urticaria test. About 830 were adults and 43 were children
(Table 1).

Methods

15 min and divided into aliquots for use in the ASST and in
basophil HR assays. Samples (50 11) of autologous serum and 0.9%
sterile saline were injected intradermally into volar forearm skin
with at least 3 cm between injection sites. Areas known to have been
involved in spontaneous weals in the last 24 h were avoided. The
ASST was considered positive if a pink weal response 1.5 mm or
greater than an adjacent saline control was seen at 30 min (14).

Serum-induced basophil histamine release — HR-Urticaria test.
Serum-induced basophil HR was performed as previously described
(15). In brief, basophil leucocytes were incubated with serum for
60 min at 37°C with 40 pl serum diluted 1:4 or 1:8 (final
concentration). To compensate for nonspecific HR because of
changed protein concentration, incubations were performed in the
absence and presence of 0.0125 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA). Serum and released histamine was removed and the cells
lysed using 20 pl of 7% perchloric acid. After lysis of the cells 200 pl
PIPES were added and the samples were centrifuged at 2000 g
for 10 min and the histamine content in the filtrate was measured using the glass fibre method (RefLab, Copenhagen, Denmark)
(16).

Histamine release was expressed as a percentage of total histamine content. Spontaneous HR from the cells was <5% when incubated with serum at final dilutions of 1: 8 or 1: 4 in the total
reaction volume.

Basophils from two normal nonatopic subjects were initially
tested for HR induced by anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) and sera
from urticaria patients. Considerably variability of response was
observed, but generally the same ranking of sera was observed.
One donor whose basophils responded to both anti-IgE and to
many of the urticaria sera was chosen for the studies reported
here. This donor was nonatopic with an IgE level of 8 kU,/l.

Assessment of sensitivity and specificity. The assay developed and
described here (the HR-Urticaria test) uses the human basophil as a
model for the reaction seen in the skin of patients. In order to
standardize the in vitro assay, the ASST outcome was used as a ‘gold
standard’ to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the basophil
assay at different cut-off values for histamine release. The calculations of sensitivity and specificity are based upon the results from
ASST and the HR-Urticaria test using only the well-characterized
CU patients from group 1. Sensitivity was calculated as (ASST- and
HR-Urticaria test-positives)/(ASST-positives) and specificity was
calculated as (ASST- and HR-Urticaria test-negatives)/(ASSTnegatives).

Results
Group 1

Basophils from the healthy donor described in Methods
were incubated with sera from the well-characterized CU
patients or HC and HR was determined. Mean (SD) HR
for the HC at a 1 : 4 final serum dilution was 12.6% (2.8)
yielding a threshold value of 18.2% (mean + 2 SD) for
significant HR in the Urtikaria-HR assay. Using this cutoff value, the sensitivity and specificity for basophil HR
were 56.3 and 83.3% by comparison with the ASST.
Maximum sensitivity and specificity of the HR-Urticaria test was achieved by assuming a threshold of HR

1153

between 16.5 and 17.5% (closed circles, Fig. 1) for 1: 4
serum dilution. By contrast, the sensitivity of the assay
was considerably less with 1:8 serum dilution (open
triangles, Fig. 1) although the specificity at this dilution
was consistently high. Based on these results a threshold
cut-off value of 16.5% was taken for all further studies of
CU sera at a 1 : 4 dilution to discriminate between those
with and without histamine-releasing activity. This value
was comparable with the threshold value derived from
the mean + 2 SD release of HC sera on the same
basophil donor.

Patients were grouped into those with and without a
positive ASST. Twelve of 16 patients with a positive
ASST and four of 12 with a negative ASST but none
of the HC elicited HR above 16.5% (Fig. 2). None of
the sera from the group of atopic dermatitis patients or
birch pollen allergic patients elicited HR above 16.5%
(results not shown). All patients had a greater response
to 1:4 than 1:8 serum dilution in the test (data not
shown).

Group 2

A total of 873 CU sera received consecutively by our
laboratory were tested by the HR-Urticaria test
(Table 1). In this unselected population there was no
difference in the frequency of positives between male
and female adults (P = 0.897) or the entire group
(P = 0.719). However, females predominated in a ratio
2:1. In the group of children between 0 and 16 years of
age there seemed to be an over-representation of females
but it was not statistically significant (P = 0.725).

35.2% of the CU sera elicited a basophil HR above
16.5%. At 1:8 serum dilution, only 10% of the tested
individuals showed significant histamine release. In this

Discussion

There is evidence to suggest that most functional autoantibodies bind to the FceRI in the presence of IgE
(noncompetitive) but a minority compete with IgE for the
receptor and will therefore not be detected on basophils
primed with IgE (4). It follows that sera to be tested should
be incubated with both stripped and native basophils to be
certain that all autoantibodies can be detected in CU.
However, it appears that priming with interleukin (IL)-3
lowers the threshold for activation of the basophil so that
the level of free FceRI is sufficient for activation, perhaps
through costimulation with other HRFs.

It has been reported that natural anti-FceRI antibodies
can interfere with basophil HR induced by autoimmune
urticaria sera (17), this can be due to methodological
differences as the amount of IL-3 used to prime the
basophils varies from 100 (17) to 0.5 ng/ml used in our
method. It has been shown that IL-3 can induce HR in
concentrations down to 10 ng/ml (18).

We present here a cellular assay able to distinguish
between patients with and without functional HRFs with
a high sensitivity and specificity. We have defined the
threshold of the HR-Urticaria test by maximizing sensitivity and specificity on a population of well-characterized
CU patients. This value is nearly the same as the
threshold derived from the mean + 2 SD of HR with
HC sera. Using a 16.5% cut-off value on a group of HC
we found no individuals with positive HR. In the group
of patients with CU, four of 16 patients with a positive
ASST failed to elicit HR above 16.5% and four of 12
patients with a negative ASST elicited HR above 16.5%.
The difference between the two groups was significant
(P = 0.0313).

Up to now we have tested 873 sera sent to our
laboratory with a clinical diagnosis of CU (Table 1) but
detailed clinical findings on these patients were not
available so this relatively unselected group may include
patients with physical and vasculitic urticarias. Applying

the results found in the well-characterized group of
patients tested using the ASST we found no difference in
the distribution of positives between male and females,
however, the frequency of women tested to men were
found to be 2: 1 in keeping with the expected gender
difference in CU. When testing for HRFs it seems
necessary to use at least a 1 : 4 serum dilution (Fig. 3),
otherwise the number of positives will be underestimated.
Using the 1 : 8 serum dilution, less than a third of the sera
found positive using 1:4 serum dilution also tested
positive. However, it may be useful to use different serum
dilutions in order to evaluate the amount of HRFs.

In this study, we have compared the basophil HR test

against the ASST test as a ‘gold standard’. The discordance between a positive ASST and a negative HRUrticaria test may be explained by a low titre of HRFs
or the presence of ‘mast cell-specific’ HRFs. A negative
ASST and a positive HR-Urticaria test might be explained
by some inherent variability of the ASST if, for instance,
the skin test had been placed in an area of previous wealing
that was relatively refractory to further stimulation.
In conclusion, serum-induced HR using the commercial
HR-Urticaria test confirmed the findings of other groups
that the outcome of basophil mediator release assays and
the ASST are related but not identical. In addition, our
studies demonstrated a reasonably high frequency of serainducing HR (35%) in patients with CU. In the present
study, only one basophil donor has been used during the
1-year study period. We have however, seen in preliminary
studies that other basophil donor cells can be used
provided that they respond to a selected panel of positive
sera. Further studies are however, needed to demonstrate
if other factors than autoantibodies against the IgE or
FceRI are involved in the release process, such as
cytokines and/or complement split products (C3a and
CSa) or as yet other unidentified HRFs.
