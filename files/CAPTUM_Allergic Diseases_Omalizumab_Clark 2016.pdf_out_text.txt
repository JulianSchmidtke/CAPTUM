Previously, Soma et al reported morphea in 9 of
135 (6.7%) patients with SSc,’ with only 4 of 9 noted
to have IcSSc. Prior studies on overlap patients have
been difficult to interpret, as the diagnostic criteria
used are often unclear. Our study was novel in that
we classified our SSc patients using the 2013 ACR/
EULAR criteria. These criteria reflect significant
diagnostic advancements and have greater sensitivity and specificity for SSc,° especially for those
with IcSSc and/or early disease, providing an opportunity to reexamine SSc and morphea overlap.

Our study was limited by its small sample size and
retrospective design. The study was not designed to
quantify the risk of morphea coexistence with SSc,
but rather to document clinical characteristics in a
cohort of overlap patients. Further, these findings
represent the clinical experience of only one institution and thus may not be generalizable to the
population at large.

Our data suggest that, although morphea and SSc
are fundamentally 2 clinically distinct diseases, they
may share common pathophysiologic and/or genetic
pathways given that the rate of overlap was higher
than expected. SSc, which may have very limited
cutaneous sclerosis, should be ruled out in patients
that have lesions of morphea, especially those with
the generalized subtype, Raynaud’s phenomenon,
and/or nailfold capillary changes.

The effect of omalizumab dosing and
frequency in chronic idiopathic urticaria: «=
Retrospective chart review

To the Editor: Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU),
defined as hives and swelling lasting longer than
6 weeks without an identifiable etiology, can be
debilitating.' Omalizumab is US Food and Drug
Administration-approved at 150 mg and 300 mg
dosing every 4 weeks (Q4W).* Our clinical experience suggests that dosing at 300 mg every 2 weeks
(Q2W) provides greater efficacy in CIU than 300 mg
Q4W. We herein present data from a retrospective
chart review investigating the efficacy and clinical
features of CIU patients treated with omalizumab at
different doses (Q2W vs Q4W).

We reviewed charts from all patients treated with
omalizumab for any cutaneous indication at a
university-based dermatology and immunology
practice from January 1, 2006, through March 31,
2015. Data from chart review included: demographics, diagnosis, duration of disease, history of
angioedema, the omalizumab dosage, frequency,
and duration of treatment, subjective clinical
response and adverse effects to therapy, therapies
used before, during, and after treatment with omalizumab, and skin biopsy findings. One limitation of
our study was a lack of uniform measures of
improvement. A significant response was determined by 2 independent reviewers using a broad
definition of a 50% reduction of urticaria using either
a severity scale of 1 to 10 or symptom frequency.
Statistical analyses using either Student ftest or
the x” test was performed using SPSS v22 (IBM,
Somers, NY).

Forty-eight patients with chronic urticarial dermatoses were identified: 43 with CIU, 2 with urticarial
vasculitis, and 3 with urticarial bullous pemphigoid.
Only patients with CIU were included in the analysis
(mean age, 43.2 years; female, 79.1%; white, 90.7%;
history of angioedema, 31%); 2 patients were lost to
follow-up. Overall 90.2% (37/41) of patients responded to omalizumab within 3 months. No significant difference was found between responders’ and
non-responders’ age, gender, history of angioedema,
or previous treatments (Table 1).

*Antihistamines failure included at least one of the following:
diphenhydramine (at least 25 mg daily), cetirizine (at least 10 mg
daily), fexofenadine (at least 180 mg daily), loratadine (at least
10 mg daily), levocetirizine (at least 5 mg daily), desloratadine (at
least 5 mg daily), hydroxyzine (at least 25 mg daily), and/or
doxepin (at least 25 mg daily).

Of 43 patients treated with omalizumab, 34 started
at 300 mg and 9 started at 150 mg. Five patients
starting at 150 mg responded, 3 patients required
300 mg Q2W for response, and 1 was lost to followup. In CIU patients receiving omalizumab 300 mg
either Q2W or Q4W, = 50% response rates were
achieved in 100.0% (24/24) of patients treated Q2W
compared with 66.7% (8/12) of patients treated Q4W
(P = .008; Table I). Adverse events were mild,
including headache, alopecia, nausea, and
arthralgia. No patients stopped the medication due
to adverse events.

Dosing of omalizumab for CIU has continued to
change based on new research. Initially, dosing
followed asthma guidelines determined by IgE
levels.’ Danish researchers published an algorithm

frequency at 2-week follow-up appointments.’ A

recent systematic review compared omalizumab 75,
150, 300, 600 mg Q4W versus placebo and
concluded that 300 mg Q4W is an effective dosing
schedule in treating CIU.’ Our retrospective cohort
suggests that higher response rates are obtained by
treating CIU with omalizumab 300 mg Q2W instead
of Q4W. Prospective studies are required to validate
this finding.

applies subunit principles to restore the severe
rhinophymatous nose.

Medical records of consecutive patients with
rhinophyma treated with the subunit method were
retrospectively studied. Patient age, gender, framework enhancement with sutures or cartilage grafts,
use of skin grafts, revisions, and follow-up were
assessed.

placed at subunit junctions (sidewalls and dorsum,
dorsum and tip, and alae and sidewalls; Fig 1). The
