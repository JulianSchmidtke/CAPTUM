tive in patients with CSU refractory to antihistamines.

 

Background: Platelet activating factor (PAF) is an endogenous, active phospholipid released from inflammatory cells,
platelets, and endothelial cells, and is involved in the regulation of immune responses. Degradation of PAF by PAF
acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) has been shown to be associated with anaphylaxis, asthma, and peanut allergy. The purpose
of this study was to investigate relationships among clinical parameters, including urticaria severity and treatment
responsiveness, and PAF and PAF-AH levels in sera from patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU).

Methods: Serum PAF and PAF-AH levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 283 CSU
patients and 111 age- and sex-matched, healthy normal controls (NCs). Urticaria severity was evaluated by urticaria
activity score over 7 days (UAS7). Within 3 months after measuring PAF levels, patients whose urticaria was not controlled by antihistamine treatment were classified as histamine receptor 1 antagonist (H1RA) non-responders.

Results: Serum PAF levels were significantly higher in CSU patients than in NCs (median 4368.9 vs. 3256.4 pg/ml,
p=0.015), while serum PAF-AH levels were significantly lower in CSU patients (105.6 vs. 125.7 ng/ml, p= 0.001). HIRA
non-responders had higher levels of PAF in their sera than H1RA responders. A generalized linear model revealed
that a higher UAS7 score (odds ratio 1.023, p= 0.024) and a PAF level > 5000 pg/ml (1.409, p <0.001) were significant

 

Conclusions: Compared with NCs, CSU patients, particularly those with H1RA refractoriness, showed significant
increases in serum PAF levels and decreases in PAF-AH. Therapies modulating PAF and PAF-AH levels could be effec

Background

Platelet activating factor (PAF, 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine) is a bioactive phospholipid
that plays a critical role in immune and inflammatory
conditions [1]. It has been found to be produced by most
immune cells, including basophils, eosinophils, mast
cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages, as well as platelets and endothelial cells [1]. PAF binds to its specific

receptor PAFR, a G protein-coupled receptor expressed
on several immune cells, including mast cells and basophils [2]. Metabolism of PAF is regulated by the enzyme
PAF-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), which is responsible for
PAF degradation. PAF has been found to be involved in
the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, psoriasis,
sepsis, and allergic diseases, including asthma, allergic
rhinitis, anaphylaxis, and urticaria [1, 3-5].

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a chronic inflammatory skin
disorder characterized by recurrent itchy wheals lasting longer than 6 weeks. CU is classified into inducible urticaria (induced by specific physical triggers) and

chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) [6]. Resulting in
vasodilatation, plasma extravasation, and inflammatory
cell migration to urticarial lesions, mast cells and basophils release various inflammatory mediators, including
histamine, protease, cytokines, chemotactic factors, arachidonic acid metabolites, neuropeptides, and PAF [6].
Accordingly, recent guidelines recommend non-sedating H1 antihistamines (histaminel receptor antagonist,
HI1RA) for first-line treatment of CSU [6]. Except for
histamine, however, the roles of inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis of CSU have yet to be thoroughly
investigated.

Research suggests that PAF plays an important role in
anaphylactic reactions, being correlated with the severity thereof [1, 7]. Interestingly, in severe anaphylaxis, PAF
levels have been found to be inversely correlated with
PAF-AH levels [8]. The present study aimed to investigate
associations of PAF and PAF-AH levels in sera in relation
to clinical implications in CSU patients.

Methods

Study subjects

In total, 283 patients with CSU who had urticaria symptoms for more than 6 weeks and 111 healthy normal
controls (NCs) were recruited. Inclusion criteria were
age>19 years and having urticaria symptoms almost
daily, such as wheals and itching or angioedema, for at
least 6 weeks. Patients with other chronic skin diseases
and those with clinical evidence of urticarial vasculitis
or inducible (physical stimuli or cholinergic or exercise)
urticaria were excluded. Sera from healthy normal controls were supplied by the Ajou University Human BioResource Bank. Normal controls (NCs) were confirmed
by the Biobank as not having any previous history of
inflammatory or allergic skin disease or urticaria.

UAS7 (urticarial activity score over 7 days), a weekly
urticaria activity score, was utilized to assess disease
activity [6]. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as
weight/height (kg/m). Aspirin intolerance was diagnosed based on a history of recurrent urticaria after
aspirin/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
ingestion or positive results of oral challenge to aspirin,
as previously described [9]. Written informed consent
was collected from all study subjects. The study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of Ajou University Medical Center (AJIRB-BMR-SMP- 18-74).

Assessment of clinical parameters

Autologous serum skin test (ASST) was performed and
evaluated in accordance with reported guidelines [10].
Atopy was defined as at least one positive skin test result
to common allergens or increased serum levels of specific
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) to Dermatophagoides farina,

Page 2 of 8

D.pteronyssinus, or other common inhalant allergens.
Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) was detected using an indirect fluorescent antibody technique (Fluoro HEPANA
test, Medical & Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan).
Total IgE and eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) were
measured by the ImmunoCAP system (Pharmacia Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Total cholestrol, triglyceride, and high
and low density lipoproteins (HDL and LDL) were measured by enzymatic colorimetric assay using a TBA-200FR
anlalyser (Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan). Complement 3 and 4
levels were measured using an immunoturbidimetric
assay (Roche Hitachi Cobas C system, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Antihistamine doses were described as equivalent
doses of loratadine (mg/day).

Serum PAF and PAF-AH levels

Before collecting serum samples, antihistamines were
withdrawn for at least 5 days. Serum samples were stored
at —70 °C until ready for use. Serum PAF and PAF-AH
levels were measured by commercial enzyme-linked
immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) kits (LifeSpan BioSciences, Inc., Seattle, WA, USA and R&D systems Inc.,
Minneapolis, MN, USA, respectively). The serum samples were diluted based on the detection ranges of PAF
(78.3-5000 pg/ml) and PAF-AH (0.781—50 ng/ml).

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS, version 25 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data
are presented as a mean+standard deviation for clinical
parameters and as a median (interquartile range [IQR])
for PAF and PAF-AH. As distributions of total IgE levels
in both CSU and NC groups, were highly right-skewed,
total IgE were logarithmically transformed (base 10) for
statistical analyses. Statistical significance was assessed
by Mann-Whitney U-test or Fisher’s exact test, and correlation analyses were conducted by Spearman's correlation. The level of PAF > 5000 pg/mL was obtained as the
cut-off for detecting non-responders to antihistamines
based on receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve
analysis (area under the curve 0.642, p<0.001). A generalized linear model was applied to determine the effects
of PAF and PAF-AH on treatment response in CSU
patients.

(23.5+3.9 vs. 23.1+2.8 kg/m’, p=0.864). The mean
urticaria duration was 26.1 months, and the mean UAS7
score was 24.4+10.3. The prevalences of angioedema
and aspirin intolerance were 45.7% and 25.5% in CSU
patients, respectively. Among the CSU patients, 30.2%
had a positive response to ASST, and 21.4% were positive on ANA. The atopy rate was 54.2%, and the mean
level of log-transformed total IgE (kU/L) was 2.09+0.5
in CSU patients. Mean serum ECP level was higher in
CSU patients than in NCs (21.7+18.9 vs. 12.7+9.6
kU/L, p< 0.001). Compared with NCs, patients with CSU
had higher levels of log-transformed total IgE (p< 0.001)
and triglycerides (150.4+98.7 vs. 104.2+60.0 mg/
dL, p<0.001) and lower levels of HDL (55.7+14.9 vs.

H1RA non-responders were defined as patients whose
symptoms could not be controlled by increasing doses
of antihistamines (up to fourfold) within 3 months, and
HI1RA responders were defined as those who responded
well to antihistamine treatment [11]. The clinical characteristics of patients according to H1RA response are
summarized in Table 2. There were no differences in age
(42.3 + 12.0 vs. 42.6 + 11.4 years, p=0.665) or sex (female
65.7 vs. 64.6%, p=0.852) between H1RA responders

and non-responders, nor were there any significant differences in BMI (23.4+4.1 vs. 23.6+3.6, p=0.577). The
mean urticaria duration of the H1RA responder group
was 28.8+56.8 months, and that for the H1IRA nonresponder group was 22.1+43.0 months (p=0.289). No
differences were observed in serum total IgE and complement levels or lipid profiles between the two groups.
H1RA non-responders had higher UAS7 scores than
those who responded well to H1IRA treatment (28.8+ 9.3
vs. 24.4+10.3, p<0.001) at initial visits. They also had
higher H1RA requirements calculated as the equivalent
dose of loratadine (mg/day) (21.0+9.4 vs. 30.8+13.3,
p<0.001) for a subsequent 3 months after enrollment
into the present study.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Serum PAF and PAF-AH levels in CSU patients and NCs
The median level of serum PAF was remarkably higher
in CSU patients than in NCs (4368.9 [17.0-14768.3] vs.
3256.4 [27.1-13886.7] pg/ml, p=0.015, Fig. la), while
the median PAF-AH level was comparably lower in CSU
patients than in NCs (105.6 [2.6-296.4] vs. 125.7 [2.0291.1] ng/ml, p<0.001, Fig. 1b). When we analyzed the
ratio of PAF-AH to PAF, CSU patients had significantly
lower PAF-AH/PAF ratios than NCs (Fig. 1c). However,
there was no correlation between serum PAF and PAFAH levels (r=0.081, p=0.175) in either CSU patients or
NCs.

 

Associations for serum PAF and PAF-AH levels

with treatment response

Interestingly, the median level of serum PAF was higher
in H1RA non-responders than in H1RA responders
(5426.3 [53.1-14768.3] vs. 3804.5 [17.0-11716.3] pg/
mL, p<0.001, Fig. 2a), while PAF-AH levels were not
(104.2 [2.6-296.4] vs. 112.0 [4.4—256.8] ng/mL, p=0.051,
Fig. 2b). PAF-AH/PAF ratio was also higher in H1IRA
responders than in H1RA non-responders (124.5 4569.0
vs. 70.8 + 278.8 ng/mL, p=0.007, Fig. 2c).

With a cut-off level for PAF of 5000 pg/mL obtained by
ROC curve analysis, we divided CSU subjects and NCs
with PAF levels >5000 pg/mL, particularly between
HIRA responder and non-responders. Among CSU
patients, 117 (41.3%) had PAF levels at least 5000 pg/mL
in their sera, whereas the rate of high PAF (> 5000 pg/
mL) in NCs was 29.7% (p=0.038, Fig. 3). The rate of
patients with high PAF was more frequent among HIRA
non-responders than among H1RA responders (57.5 vs.
30.2%, p< 0.001, Fig. 3).

To identify predictors of responsiveness to antihistamine treatment in patients with CSU, we performed
multivariate analysis using a generalized linear model
containing age, sex, urticaria duration, UAS7, total
IgE levels, BMI, ASST response, PAF-AH levels, and

Discussion

The present study demonstrates that PAF levels are
increased and that PAF-AH levels are decreased in the
sera from CSU patients, compared with those in healthy
controls. These results are consistent with previous
reports on increased PAF levels in anaphylactic patients
[8, 12] and in asthmatics [13].

PAF is a rapid synthesizing, potent signaling phospholipid produced in response to stress, chemotactic factors,
phagocyte stimulation, exogenous antigens or IgE/IgG,
thrombin, IL-1, bacteria, or calcium ionophore [1]. PAF
is synthesized and released from various immune cells,
including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, platelets, eosinophils, and vascular endothelial cells [1], and
accumulating evidence indicates that PAF is involved in
inflammation and coagulation through its specific receptor expressed on a wide variety of cell surfaces [14]. PAF
induces aggregation and activation of neutrophils to
produce reactive oxygen species and eicosanoids, and
PAF can augment IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) production via human cells. Meanwhile, IL-1 and
TNF promotes the release of PAF in neutrophils, macrophages, and endothelial cells. Prior reports of perivascular cellular infiltration of neutrophils, eosinophils, T
cells, and monocytes, as well as increased expression of
IL-6 and TNF-a, in urticarial lesions [15] suggest that
PAF could be a key player in the pathogenesis of CU.
Indeed, intradermal injection of PAF has been found to
induce transient wheals with increases in vascular permeability followed by neutrophil infiltration [16].

Previously, Amin et al. [17] reported that neutrophilic
infiltrates on skin biopsy from CU patients is a marker of
poor control. In the present study, a high level of serum
PAF (>5000 pg/mL) in CSU patients was identified as a
novel predictor of a poor response to antihistamine treatment: higher PAF levels can lead to massive neutrophil
chemotaxis and finally result in H1RA resistance. PAF
as a short half-life (3-13 min) due to its fast metabolism
by circulating PAF-AH, which also degrades oxidized
hospholipids [8]. We found increased PAF levels and a
lower PAF-AH to PAF ratio in CSU patients, compared
with NCs. This suggests that impaired degradation of PAF
caused by decreased PAF-AH levels might be a reason for
increased PAF levels in CSU patients. However, we only
‘ound a marginal and statistically insignificant difference
in PAF-AH levels between CSU patients and NCs and
no difference according to H1RA treatment responses
among CSU patients. The secretion of PAF-AH is reguated by various cytokines, as well as steroid hormones

and gender. Pro-inflammatory cytokines known to be
elevated in CSU patients, including IL-6, TNF-a, and
interferon-gamma (IFN-y), can stimulate macrophages to
express both PAF-AH and complement as a physiologic
response [18]. Accordingly, we noted significant correlations between PAF-AH and complements 3 and 4 in
CSU patients in the present study. Moreover, we previously reported the co-existence of metabolic syndrome in
severe refractory urticaria patients who had higher complement levels [19]. Additionally, increased levels of PAFAH and LDL were found to be associated with abdominal
adiposity in obese children and adults with metabolic
syndrome [20, 21]. Interestingly, in the present study, significant correlations for BMI, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and complement levels with serum PAF-AH levels in
patients with CSU were also observed. Consistent with
previous reports in which estrogen was found to decrease
PAF-AH levels, we also found that females had significantly lower levels of PAF-AH than males among both
CSU patients and NCs [22]. However, because no difference was observed in PAF-AH levels between HIRA
responders and non-responders, the pathologic effects of
PAF-AH in CSU remains to be elucidated.

Research has demonstrated that recombinant PAFAH attenuates inflammation in a variety of experimental
models and that genetic deficiency of PAF-AH increases
the severity of atherosclerosis and other inflammatory
syndromes [18]. Correlating with severity, PAF-AH has
been found to be decreased in both asthmatic patients
and mice [22, 23]. Moreover, reports have indicated that
human PAF is associated with increased nasal airway
resistance to histamine and nasal symptoms [24, 25]. A
PAFR deficient asthma mouse model showed reduced
airway hyper-responsiveness [22, 26, 27], and studies
have revealed correlations between increased PAF levels
and anaphylaxis severity [8, 12]. Accordingly, inactivation
of PAF or PAF receptor antagonist has been proven to
prevent anaphylaxis in vivo [28, 29].

The estimated prevalence of CSU worldwide is around
0.5-1%, and 50% of CSU individuals do not achieve control with H1RA treatment [30]. While biomarkers to
predict H1RA responsiveness in CSU patients would
be helpful, evidence thereof is sparse. Meanwhile, an
increase in serum levels of lipocalin-2 has been suggested
as a useful biomarker with which to determine clinical
responses to antihistamine treatment in CSU patients:
this biomarker has also been shown to be correlated with
metabolic syndrome and obesity [11, 31]. Additionally,
D-dimer, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte
sedimentation rate have been highlighted as promising
biomarkers for predicting poor responses to antihistamine treatment [32]. Also, increases in IL-6 have been
reported in refractory CU [33]. Notably, these features of
Ulambayar et al. Clin Transl Allergy (2019) 9:33

activating coagulation and chronic low-grade inflammation, which are observed in severe CU, can be linked with
increases in PAF levels and PAF-induced coagulation and
inflammation.

Rupatadine is a long-acting H1-antihistamine that
antagonizes PAF and has recently been shown to be effective in allergic diseases, including urticaria [34, 35]. It has
been found to decrease the severity of peanut-induced
anaphylaxis and to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and cold urticaria [36-38]. As indicated in
multivariate analysis in the present study, higher UAS7
score and high PAF levels (PAF > 5000 pg/mL) at baseline could be significant predictors of a poor response to
HIRA treatment. Therapeutic strategies to inhibit PAF
or to stimulate PAF-AH might be beneficial for HIRA
refractory CSU patients.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we found serum levels of PAF to be
increased and PAF-AH levels to be decreased in CSU
patients, compared with healthy controls. Accordingly,
we propose that high levels of PAF in serum could be a
potential predictor of refractoriness to antihistamine
treatment in CSU patients. For severe patients with high
UAS7 scores, increasing antihistamines with the addition
of a PAF antagonist may help to achieve better control
of CU earlier. Further studies are required to elucidate
PAF and PAF-AH signaling and therapeutic modulation
thereof in CSU.
