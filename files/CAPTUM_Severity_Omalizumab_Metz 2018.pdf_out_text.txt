ABSTRACT

Background: Omalizumab, a humanized recombinant monoclonal anti-IgE antibody proved
to be effective in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), including severe and
treatment-refractory CSU. Here we report omalizumab’s effect on gene expression in skin
biopsies from CSU patients enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

Methods: CSU patients (18-75 years) were randomized to either 300 mg omalizumab (n=20)
or placebo (n=10) administered s.c. every 4 weeks for 12 weeks (NCT01599637). Lesional
and nonlesional skin biopsies were collected from the same area of consenting patients and
assessed at baseline and on Day 85 compared with skin biopsies from the same area of 10
untreated healthy volunteers (HVs). Gene expression data were generated using Affymetrix
HG-U133Plus2.0 microarrays. Statistical analyses were performed using R packages.
Results: At baseline, 63 transcripts were differentially expressed between lesional and
nonlesional skin. Two thirds of these lesional signatures were also differentially expressed
between lesional and HV skin. Upon treatment with omalizumab, >75% of lesional
signatures changed to reflect nonlesional skin expression levels (different versus placebo, P
<0.01). Transcripts upregulated in lesional skin (versus nonlesional and/or HV skin)

suggested increased mast cell/leukocyte infiltration (FCER1G, C3AR1, CD93, S100A8, and

S100A9), increased oxidative stress, vascularization (CYR61), and skin repair events
(KRT6A, KRT16). Lesional signatures were not modulated by treatment in nonresponders
(defined based on UAS7 longitudinal changes >16).

Conclusions: Omalizumab, in treatment responders, reverted transcriptional signatures
associated with CSU lesion phenotype to reflect nonlesional/HV expression levels; this is
consistent with observed omalizumab-mediated clinical improvement observed in patients

with CSU.

Introduction

Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to IgE at its
binding site to high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRJ) (1-3). It is effective in the treatment of
chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) (4-11), including in patients who have relapsed after
discontinuing treatment with omalizumab (12). Omalizumab is approved for treatment of

CSU patients who remain symptomatic despite H;-antihistamine treatment (13, 14).

Urticaria is characterized by the development of hives and angioedema (15), both of which
develop when skin mast cells get activated, degranulate, and release histamine and other
proinflammatory mediators (16-21). Omalizumab is known to prevent the signs and
symptoms of CSU via its effects on IgE levels and FceRI expression; this notion is based on
several indirect and direct lines of evidence: (i) the pathology of CSU lesions resembles that
of allergen-mediated late-phase skin reactions, suggesting involvement of FceRI activation of
mast cells and basophils(22); (ii) CSU patients have been described to have histaminereleasing IgG autoantibodies against either FceRI or IgE (23-25) as well as mast cellactivating IgE autoantibodies against autoantigens such as thyreoperoxidase (26); (iii)
patients with CSU, treatment with omalizumab reduces serum levels of IgE by >90% within
the initial days after initiation of therapy (27); and (iv) in CSU patients, omalizumab
treatment, over the course of initial 3 months, leads to reduction in FceRI+ and IgE+ cells in

the dermis (27).

Nevertheless, what is less clear is how omalizumab affects the skin of CSU patients
following reduced mast cell degranulation and wheal development. In fact, there is virtually
no published information on how skin responses to mast cell degranulation and whealing
differ in CSU patients who do or do not receive omalizumab treatment. Does omalizumab

affect blood vessels, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and other skin cells at sites of whealing? Does

omalizumab reduce the influx of basophils, neutrophils, eosinophils, and other cells to sites of
CSU wheal formation? Does omalizumab protect from the long-term consequences of
recurrent whealing, such as increased number of skin blood vessels, mast cells, and
eosinophils, all of which are seen in the nonlesional (postlesional and “ready-to-wheal”) skin
of CSU patients (28-30)? Answers to these questions could help us better understand the
mechanisms of action of omalizumab in CSU as well as the pathogenesis of CSU. More

importantly, answers to these questions may help optimize CSU treatment strategies.

To this end, we characterized the gene expression profiles of lesional skin (i.e., wheals) and
nonlesional skin (i.e., skin not currently affected by wheals) of CSU patients before and after
12 weeks of treatment with omalizumab and of skin from healthy volunteers (HVs). Our
analyses have been built on the results of three previous gene profiling studies of lesional and

nonlesional skin in CSU patients who were not receiving omalizumab treatment (31-33).

Methods

This study was an exploratory, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled
Phase II study (NCT01599637, EudraCT no. 2011-004216-31). Patients were enrolled at four
clinical centers in Germany. The study was conducted in accordance with applicable local
regulations (including European Directive 2001/20/EC, US Code of Federal Regulations Title
21, and Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare), the International Conference on
Harmonization E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and the ethical principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol and all amendments were reviewed by the
independent ethics committee or institutional review board for each center, and written

informed consent was obtained from each study participant before enrollment.

Clinical study design

Details of the study design were reported previously (27). In brief, the treatment period was
12 weeks; on Day 1 of the treatment period, patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to
omalizumab 300 mg or placebo (3 subcutaneous doses at 4-week intervals, i.e., at Day 1,

Week 4, and Week 8). After discontinuing the treatment, patients were followed for an

additional 8 weeks (follow-up). Gene expression was analyzed from skin biopsies taken from
CSU patients at baseline and Week12 from nonlesional and lesional skin (available samples

are summarized in Table 1). In addition, a single skin biopsy was collected from HVs. HVs

 

were age and gender matched (+ 2 years) male or female adults (18-75 years of age) in good
health as determined by past medical history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECG

and laboratory tests.

Patient inclusion/exclusion criteria

The study included CSU patients (18-75 years) who remained symptomatic despite Hantihistamine treatment at approved doses, characterized by the re-occurrence of itch and
hives for >6 weeks before baseline, with a UAS7 score of at least 16 and an itch component
of UAS7 of at least 8 during 2 weeks before randomization. Patients had to have had a CSU
diagnosis for at least 6 months and be on an approved dose of an H)-antihistamine for CSU

before entering the study.

Thirty patients were randomized to treatment: 20 in the omalizumab group and 10 in the
placebo group. In addition, 10 (age- and gender-matched) HVs participated in this study.
Subject demographics and baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 2. The
omalizumab and placebo groups of CSU patients were generally well matched for

demographic characteristics. Details have been reported previously (27).

Clinical efficacy data

Decreases in UAS7 after omalizumab treatment initiation were rapid (with separation of
curves at Day 3) and sustained. At Week 12, the LS mean difference in UAS7 between
treatment groups was —14.82 (P=0.0027). Over 50% of patients from the omalizumab group
were UAS7 responders at Week 12 (response to omalizumab treatment was defined as UAS7
<6 while nonresponse was defined as UAS7 =16). Approximately half of these had become
responders by the end of Week 2. In contrast, <15% of patients receiving placebo had

improved by Week 12, without any changes occurring by Week 2 (27).

Transcriptional assessment of skin biopsies
Sample collection

Skin biopsies with a minimum diameter of 6 mm were taken at each scheduled time-point.
Baseline biopsies were collected from one location with lesional skin and from another with
nonlesional skin. Following treatment, biopsies were collected at locations close to the
locations chosen at baseline. Skin biopsy samples were stored at —80°C until analyzed (see

Table 1 for details).

Microarray-based data generation

The effects on omalizumab on skin biopsies’ gene expression were assessed using Affymetrix
HG-U133Plus2.0 oligonucleotide microarrays (http://www.affymetrix.com/). After
condensing to gene level analysis and filtering probesets, approximately 8,050 transcripts

remained in the dataset.

Statistical analyses

All quality control and normalization of microarray-derived data were conducted in R: a
language and environment for statistical computing (R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria. http://www.R-project.org/). QC and normalization using RMA of the
transcriptional dataset were conducted using a series of packages downloaded from
www.arrayanalysis.org. The "hgul33plus2hsentrezg" Chip Definition File
(http://brainarray.mbni.med.umich.edu/) was used for mapping probes to gene products.
Affymetrix technical probesets as well as probesets showing low expression levels (1.¢.,
normalized and scaled expression <100) were filtered out. Subsequently, the resulting dataset
was considered ready for downstream statistical analyses. In brief, linear models, as
implemented in the R package limma, were used to assess the differences in gene expression:
both longitudinal treatment induced (referenced to baseline) and across CSU baseline
phenotypes (i.e., CSU lesional, CSU nonlesional, and healthy skin). The level of significance
and absolute magnitude of change thresholds used to identify differentially expressed genes

(DEGs) were setup at P values <0.05 and absolute fold change >1.50, respectively. The False

Discovery Rate (FDR) approach was used to correct nominal P values for multiple testing.

For analysis, first, baseline lesional and nonlesional data were compared. Second, both were
compared to HV skin. Since all baseline samples were untreated, both omalizumab and

placebo groups were combined for these comparisons.

IPA Upstream Regulator Analysis

Upstream Regular Analysis was performed by using IPA (QIAGEN Inc.,
https://www.qiagenbio-informatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis). The goal of
the Upstream Regulator analytic is to identify the cascade of upstream transcriptional

regulators (TRs) that can explain the observed gene expression changes in a user’s dataset.

In brief, upstream regulator analysis is based on prior knowledge of expected effects between
TRs and their target genes stored in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. In particular, this
analysis examines how many known targets of each transcription regulator are present in the
user’s dataset and compares their direction of change (i.e., expression in the experimental
sample[s] relative to control) to what is expected from literature in order to predict likely
relevant TRs. If the observed direction of change is mostly consistent with an activation state
of the TR (“activated” or “inhibited”), then a prediction is made about that activation state.
For each potential TR, two statistical measures, an overlap P value, and an activation z-score
are computed. The overlap P value calls likely upstream regulators based on significant
overlap between dataset genes and known targets regulated by a TR. The activation z-score is
used to infer likely activation states of upstream regulators based on comparison with a model

that assigns random regulation directions.

Results

What is the gene expression profile of wheals, i.e., the “lesional skin signature,” in CSU

patients?

This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
The lesional skin of CSU patients showed a distinct gene expression signature in comparison
with their nonlesional skin and the skin of HVs (Figure 1A): 63 and 106 genes were
differentially expressed between CSU lesional and nonlesional skin (the “lesional” signature;
Table 3) and between CSU lesional and HV skin (Table $1), respectively. Two thirds of
DEGs in CSU lesional versus nonlesional skin were also DEGs in the CSU lesional versus
HV comparison. The lesional skin signature was characterized by transcripts linked to
increased mast cells (17) and leukocyte infiltration (FCER1G, C3AR1, CD93, S100A8, and
S100A9), increased oxidative stress, vascularization (CYR61), and skin repair events

(KRT6A, KRT16).

Upstream regulator analysis identified the potential involvement of several transcription
factors/regulators (TP63, STAT3), kinases (EGFR), and cytokines (TNF, IL6, IL1A, IL1B)
as regulators (Table 4) of the transcriptional changes underlying the transcriptional
differences noted between lesional and nonlesional CSU skin. In brief, this analysis predicted

all aforementioned regulators as activated in CSU lesion biopsies.
What is the gene expression profile of nonlesional skin of CSU patients?

The nonlesional skin of CSU patients did not show a distinct gene expression signature
(Figure 1A). Only 9 DEGs were differentially expressed in nonlesional CSU skin compared
with HV skin (Table S2). Upregulated transcripts were related to dendritic cells (CD209),
complement (C1QB), cell cycling (MPEG1), and inflammation (IL10RA). Downregulated
genes were related to a transporter (SLC47A2), a protein of the vitamin A family (CRABP1),
and an endothelin receptor (EDNRB).

Omalizumab treatment changes the lesional but not the nonlesional skin expression profile of

CSU patients

After 12 weeks of treatment, the number of wheals/day had markedly decreased in most
omalizumab-treated, but not placebo-treated, patients. In omalizumab-treated patients, but not
placebo-treated patients, lesional skin signatures of patients were different than before
treatment, as assessed using heatmap analyses (Figure 1A). In contrast, omalizumab did not
change the nonlesional skin gene expression profile of CSU patients versus baseline and

versus placebo (Figure 1A).

Omalizumab makes the gene expression profile of lesional CSU skin look like that of

nonlesional skin but only in patients with clinical benefits from treatment

Lesional skin gene expression profiles in most CSU patients who had received 12 weeks of
omalizumab treatment closely resembled those of nonlesional CSU skin and HV skin. The
proportion of lesional signature genes (comprising 63 transcripts differentially expressed
between lesional and nonlesional samples at baseline) resolving towards levels observed in
HVs at Day 85 were contrasted between treated patients and placebos via a two-tailed Fisher
exact test. Among omalizumab-treated patients, 50/63 (79%) signature genes moved toward
HV levels, whereas among placebo-treated patients, 34/63 signature genes moved toward HV

levels (P=0.0043).

Of note, only patients who benefitted from omalizumab treatment exhibited normalization of
their lesional skin signatures, whereas nonresponders did not (Figure 1B). Four of 10

omalizumab-treated patients were nonresponders, defined by a Week 12 UAS7 score of 216.
All these 4 patients had posttreatment lesional skin expression profiles that were very similar

to those of baseline lesional skin.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that omalizumab changes transcriptional

responses of the skin of CSU patients. In line with previous observations, gene expression in
the skin of CSU patients shows a distinct signature in lesional skin that is different from that
in nonlesional or HV skin. Omalizumab reverts this signature to “normal,” and this is linked

to its clinical effects.

Patel et al. investigated gene expression in lesional and nonlesional skin of patients with CSU
(n=8) and in the skin of healthy controls (n=6) by using an Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST
Array (31); 506 and 51 genes were found to be upregulated and reduced in lesional skin,
respectively. The most upregulated genes were linked to cell adhesion (e.g., selectin E), cell
activation (e.g., CD69), and chemotaxis (CCL2). These findings are consistent with our
observation that CCL2 was the most strongly upregulated gene among the 63 genes
differentially expressed in lesional skin versus nonlesional skin. From the 12 genes most

differentially upregulated with the largest fold change in the study by Patel et al., 6 genes

were also differentially expressed in our study (CCL2, THBS1, S100A8, STEAP4, CTSL,
and UAP1), with similar but lower upregulation (Table 3). These genes are associated with
inflammatory responses (predicted increase in NFKB, TNF, IL1B, and ILIA activity).
Moreover, our findings of increased mast cell /leukocyte infiltration (FCER1G, C3AR1,
CD93, S100A8, and S100A9), increased oxidative stress, vascularization (CYR61, also
predicted increased PDGF-BB activity), and skin repair events (KRT6A, KRT16) are well in
line with these previously published data, although not all previous studies support this

conclusion (17, 34, 35).

Furthermore, upregulation of chemokine CCL2 and CXCL8 expression by monocytes has
previously been reported in CSU (36). CCL2, also referred to as MCP1 CCL2 is primarily
secreted by monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. It exhibits chemotactic activity for
monocytes and basophils (37) and it has been shown to induce histamine release from human
basophils (38) and mast cells (39). The upregulation of CCL2 in lesional skin points to the

important role of basophils and mast cells in the development of CSU lesions.

A more recent study by Gimenez-Arnau et al. reported 103 genes to be differentially
expressed in lesional CSU skin (wheals) compared with nonlesional skin (32). The involved
functional pathways included cellular movement, inflammation, cellular growth, and
differentiation, as well as cell-to-cell signaling. The functional networks related to more
DEGs were built around IL1A, IL6, CCL2, and FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene
homolog B (FOSB) (Table 3). This is in line with our IPA upstream regulator analysis,
which revealed the potential activation of IL1A and IL6 among other cytokines involved in

inflammation (Table 4).

Our findings suggest that there are only few long-term changes in skin gene expression in
CSU, as nonlesional skin only showed 9 DEGs compared with the skin of HVs. GimenezArnau et al., by using Agilent whole human genome microarrays, quantitative real-time PCR,
and an IPA, identified 31 differentially expressed (and confirmed) genes in nonlesional skin
of CSU patients versus skin of healthy controls.; these upregulated genes in nonlesional skin
were related to epidermal homeostasis, inflammation, and dermal repair. In line with our
findings, the number of regulated genes was lower than what they had observed by
comparing lesional skin versus nonlesional skin, wherein 103 differentially expressed (and
confirmed) genes were identified (32). On the other hand, Bankova et al. identified more

DEGs in nonlesional CSU skin than we or Gimenez-Arnau et al. did: 121 upregulated and 62

downregulated genes in CSU compared with nonatopic controls (33). In contrast, data from
Patel et al. did not reveal statistically significant gene expression differences between

nonlesional skin and skin from healthy control subjects (31).

Taken together, the observations from previous studies by Patel and co-workers and
Gimenez-Arnau and co-workers, together with the findings in our study, support the concept,
that CSU, by nature, is not characterized by continued overt inflammatory changes of the
skin. Rather, our results emphasize the difference in gene expression between lesional and
non-lesional skin of CSU patients versus indicating baseline differences between non-lesional
and healthy skin. Reasons for certain discrepancies between these gene expression studies
may include differences in the techniques employed for skin sampling, sample analysis (gene
expression analysis), as well as differences in the patient and healthy control populations,

which were overall rather small.

Omalizumab treatment changes gene expression in lesional but not nonlesional skin of CSU

patients

Omalizumab treatment for 12 weeks did not significantly alter the expression of genes in
nonlesional skin. However, it markedly changed the gene expression profile of whealing skin,
while placebo treatment did not; this effect of omalizumab treatment on transcriptional
response of the skin while whealing suggests that omalizumab, in addition to reducing wheal
numbers, may change the quality of wheals. It would be interesting to study if the wheals
observed in CSU patients differ before and during omalizumab treatment in terms of

duration, size, and other features; this might be addressed in future studies.

Hypotheses on how omalizumab changes the gene expression profile of lesional CSU skin to

look like that of nonlesional or HV skin

There may be several mechanisms involved by which omalizumab treatment could alter
transcriptional skin response to wheals, i.e., make the gene expression profile of lesional CSU

skin appear as that of nonlesional skin:

Omalizumab reduces free IgE levels (and FceRI expression) and, subsequently, wheal

formation and disease activity (40). When wheals do occur in omalizumab-treated CSU

patients, the reduced levels of free IgE and FceRI may result in reduced mast cell activation
and less degranulation. This, in turn, may lead to reduced inflammatory responses, which fail

to induce development of the lesional gene expression signature.

Another mechanism may be that the degranulation of MCs that induces wheals which lead to
the CSU lesional signature requires two distinct signals: a degranulator and a degranulation
modulator/modifier. Thus, omalizumab, by acting on IgE and FceRI expression, two welldescribed modulators/modifiers of MC degranulation, may change how MCs respond to the
induction of degranulation. IgE and FceRI expression modulates the strength of degranulation
and the production and release of cytokines and other mediators by mast cells, which may be
needed to induce the distinct gene profile of lesional CSU skin. These mechanisms might be
complementary, and other mechanisms, such as normalization of mast cell numbers in the

skin of CSU patients by omalizumab, may be involved.

Normalization of the lesional CSU skin signature by omalizumab is linked to its clinical

efficacy

Of note, omalizumab only normalized the lesional gene expression in patients who benefitted
from this treatment and not in nonresponders; these findings provide additional support that
the normalization of short-term skin responses while whealing are due to the effects of
omalizumab on the signs and symptoms of CSU. It shows that omalizumab, in patients who
benefit from treatment, has effects that go beyond the reduction of wheal numbers and other
markers of disease activity, because the wheals that develop in omalizumab treatment
responders appear to be different and are unable to produce the gene expression profile that
defines a “normal” wheal, i.e. a CSU not influenced by anti-IgE treatment. In future studies it
would be of interest to compare the gene expression in CSU wheals (un-treated and treated)
to the gene expression of lesions in dermatographism or cold urticaria as there is mast cell
secretion but no cellular infiltration. This would help to understand the underlying pathologic
differences between the diseases and potentially reveal key mechanisms of omalizumab

treatment in CSU.

Limitations

Limitations of the study were the small sample size and the lack of additional documentation
(e.g. pictures) and characterization of the wheals which could have been linked to the gene
expression data. We aren’t aware of any particular technical issue on the probes selected for
the gene(s) under scope and therefore, haven’t considered a confirmation by RTPCR/immunohistochemistry as mandatory. Data from previous publications support our data

and thereby validate our gene expression data to some extent.

Conclusions

Omalizumab not only prevents the development of wheals but also downstream changes in
the skin in response to wheals that occur despite treatment. Our findings, if confirmed, should
prompt further investigations regarding the mechanisms that underlie these effects. Enhanced
understanding of the mechanism of action of omalizumab on wheals and their downstream
consequences in the skin of CSU patients can help better understand the pathogenesis of
CSU, improve treatment efficacy of omalizumab in CSU patients, and develop new targeted

treatment options for management of CSU.
