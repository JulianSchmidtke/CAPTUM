Abstract
Background: Most data on chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) originate from highly

selected patient populations treated at specialized centers. Little is known about CSU patient
characteristics and the burden of CSU in routine clinical practice. AWARE (A World-wide
Antihistamine-Refractory chronic urticaria patient Evaluation) is an ongoing global study

designed to assess chronic urticaria in the real-life setting.

Objective: To describe the baseline characteristics of the first 1,539 German AWARE

patients with H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU.

Methods: This prospective non-interventional study included patients (18 to 75 years) with a
diagnosis of H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU for >2 months. Baseline demographic and
disease characteristics, comorbidities, and pharmacological treatments were recorded.
Quality of life (QoL) was assessed using the dermatology life quality index (DLQI), chronic
urticaria QoL questionnaire (CU-Q20L), and angioedema QoL questionnaire (AE-QoL; in
cases of angioedema). Previous healthcare resource utilization and sick leave data were
collected retrospectively.

Results: Between March and December 2014, 1,539 patients were assessed in 256 sites
across Germany. The percentage of females, mean age, and mean body mass index was
70%, 46.3 years, and 27 kg/m’, respectively. The mean UCT score was 7.9, 1 in 2 patients

had angioedema, and the most frequent comorbidities were chronic inducible urticaria

(CIndU; 24%), allergic rhinitis (18.2%), hypertension (18.1%), asthma (12%), and depression
(9.5%). Overall, 57.6% of patients were receiving at least one pharmacological treatment
including second generation H1-antihistamines (46.3%), first generation H1-antihistamines
(9.1%), and corticosteroids (15.8%). The mean DLQI, total CU-Qz0L, and total AE-QoL
scores were 8.3, 36.2, and 46.8, respectively. CSU patients reported frequent use of
healthcare resources, including emergency services (29.7%), general practitioners (71.9%),

and additional allergists or dermatologists (50.7%).

Conclusion & Clinical Relevance: This study reveals that German H1-antihistaminerefractory CSU patients have high rates of uncontrolled disease, angioedema, and comorbid

ClndU, are undertreated, have impaired QoL, and rely heavily on healthcare resources.

Introduction

Chronic urticaria (CU), one of the most frequent skin disorders, is defined as the repeated
occurrence of red, swollen, itchy and sometimes painful hives (wheals), and/or angioedema
(swellings in the deeper layers of the skin), for more than 6 weeks [1, 2]. CU has an
estimated worldwide prevalence of approximately 1% [3], which includes spontaneous and
inducible types. In chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), the most common type of CU,
symptoms occur without a specific trigger [1, 3]. In contrast, in chronic inducible urticaria
(ClIndU), symptoms occur in response to specific stimuli, such as exposure to cold, heat or

pressure [4]. Patients may suffer from CSU and CindU in parallel [2].

Most previously published data on CSU patients originate from highly selected patient
populations treated at specialized centers, which tend to treat patients who suffer from
severe disease, and may not reflect the average patient [5, 6]. Thus, little is known about the
burden of disease, the use of healthcare resources and the socio-economic burden of the
majority of H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU patients treated by office-based physicians.

Previous publications have shown that, despite the available S3-CU guidelines [1, 3, 7], in

routine clinical practice CU is perceived as hard to treat, cost intensive, time-consuming, and

problematic [8].

Many questions remain unanswered and need to be addressed in the broader H1antihistamine-refractory CSU population: What is the average disease activity? How
frequently does angioedema occur in CSU patients? How often do CSU and ClndU occur in
the same patient? Is the treatment of patients in line with the current guidelines? How are
CSU patients affected in their daily lives, and what impact does CSU have on patient quality
of life (QoL)? How do CSU patients use the available healthcare resources? These
questions must be answered to improve the treatment and management of CSU patients in

routine clinical practice.

AWARE (A World-wide Antihistamine-Refractory chronic urticaria patient Evaluation) is an
ongoing prospective non-interventional study (NIS) that assesses the therapy regimens,
burden of disease and rates of healthcare resource utilization of H1-antihistamine-refractory
CU patients treated by office-based dermatologists or specialized urticaria centers. Here, we
report the baseline characteristics, disease activity, frequency of angioedema and other
comorbidities, pharmacological treatment, QoL, and the rates of healthcare resource

utilization of more than 1,500 German AWARE patients.

Methods

Patients and Study Design

AWARE is an ongoing prospective NIS that will follow CU patients, who are refractory to at
least the approved dose of one H1-antihistamine, for two years. The present study reports
on German H1-antihistamine-refractory patients who were enrolled in urticaria centers and
office-based dermatological practices between March 2014 and December 2014. Urticaria

centers and office-based dermatologists were initially informed about the trial via a letter;

study sponsor Medical Scientific Experts also informed urticaria centers in person. Any
center or dermatologist that indicated interest in participating was subsequently visited
before beginning the trial. In Germany, 56% of office-based dermatologists (IMS OneKey,
The Worldwide Healthcare Professional Database) and virtually all dermatologists at

urticaria centers are also allergists or allergists in training.

Patients who received a medically confirmed diagnosis of CSU that had been present for
longer than 2 months, who were refractory to treatment with H1-antihistamines (evidence of
failed labelled dose or up-to 4 fold labelled dose), 218 years and able to provide informed
consent were eligible for inclusion in this study. Patients were excluded from the study if
difficulties were anticipated with patient follow-up or if they were participating in a CU

indication (or similar) clinical trial.

Patients were informed about the study, and written consent was obtained from each patient
at the first visit. During the first visit, demographic data (including height, weight, age, and
gender), disease activity, comorbidities, current pharmacological treatment, satisfaction with
current treatment (using a visual analog scale [VAS]), and health-related QoL were
assessed. Patients also reported how frequently they had missed work (sick leave) and how
frequently they had visited additional healthcare resources (including emergency services;
hospitalizations; general practitioners; specialized urticaria centers; dermatologists;
allergists; ear, nose, and throat specialists; dentists; and alternative practitioners) since their

urticaria symptoms first appeared.

Patient-reported outcomes

Four patient-reported outcomes (PROs: urticaria control test [UCT], dermatology QoL index
[DLQI], chronic urticaria QoL questionnaire [CU-Q,oL] and, for patients with angioedema,
the angioedema QoL questionnaire [AE-QoL]) were offered and used to assess disease

control and the impact of CSU on patients’ QoL. UCT is a new PRO tool, which

retrospectively assesses patients’ burden of disease over the previous four weeks. UCT
consists of four questions that cover disease activity, QoL, disease control, and therapy. A
UCT score of 212 points (range from 0 to 16 points) indicates that a patient’s urticaria is
controlled and a score of <12 points indicates that the urticaria is uncontrolled [9]. The DLQI
consists of 10 items covering six subdomains: symptoms and feelings, daily activities,
leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. An overall DLQI score
(range from 0 to 30 points) of 0-1, 2-5, 6-10, 11-20 and 21-30 indicates that CSU is having
no effect, a small effect, a moderate effect, a very large effect, or an extremely large effect
on a patient's QoL, respectively [10]. The CU-Q,0L is a self-administered 23-item
questionnaire used to assess CSU-specific QoL. Using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not at all; 5
= very much) patients indicated how much CSU affects their overall functioning, sleep,
itching/embarrassment, mental status, swelling/eating, and limits looks [11]. Finally, the AEQoL (developed for patients with angioedema) consists of 17 items covering four
subdomains: functioning, fatigue/mood, fears/shame, and nutrition [12]. The total scores of
the CU-Q.oL and AE-QoL questionnaires range of from O to 100, with higher scores

reflecting greater impairment in QoL.

RESULTS

Demographic characteristics and disease activity

A total of 1,577 H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU patients were documented in 256 sites
across Germany between March 2014 and December 2014; 1,539 patients met all the
inclusion criteria (n = 38 were excluded; n = 19 patients were missing a core variable [age,
gender, or time of diagnosis], n = 16 did not meet all inclusion criteria [n = 2 <18 years, n =
10 were diagnosed <2 months, and n = 4 did not have evidence of being H1-antihistaminerefractory], n = 4 patients were participating in another CU trial, and difficulties with follow-up
were anticipated for n = 3 patients) and were included in this analysis. This included patients
who had CSU only (n = 1,170; 76% of total) and patients with CSU and ClndU concomitantly
(n = 369; 24% of total). Overall, 73.9% and 26.1% of patients were treated by office-based
dermatologists and urticaria hospital centers, respectively. Seventy percent of patients were
female and the mean (SD) age was 46.3 (15.6) years, with a peak prevalence in patients
aged 45 to <55 years (23.9%; 18 to <25 years, 9.0%; 25 to <35 years, 17.8%; 35 to <45,
18.8%; 55 to <65 years, 17.4%; 65 to <75 years, 9.1%; 275 years, 4.0%). The mean (SD)
time since CSU was diagnosed was 4.8 (7.2) years and the mean (SD) body mass index

(BMI) was 27 (5.4) kg/m? (Table 1).

The mean (SD) UCT score was 7.9 (4.3). Overall, 77.5% of patients scored <12 at baseline,
indicating uncontrolled urticaria. Similarly, the VAS score for patient satisfaction with current

therapy was low (mean, 5.4; SD, 3.1).

Approximately 27% of patients reported sick leave due to urticaria. The mean (SD) duration
of sick leave was 9.1 (11.7) weeks since symptoms first appeared. Additionally, for patients
with angioedema, the mean (SD) duration of sick leave was 9.3 (8.7) weeks since symptoms

first appeared.

Angioedema is frequent in H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU patients

Overall, 55.2% of H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU patients were classified as having CSU
without angioedema, 46.1% as having CSU with angioedema, and 2.9% as having
angioedema without wheals. These percentages add up to slightly more than 100% due toa
small number of cases when physicians classified a patient who exclusively develops
angioedema but not wheals as both, “CSU with angioedema” and “angioedema without

wheals”, which is in line with the guidelines.

Angioedema had occurred during the previous 6 months in 43.4% of patients. The average
intensity of angioedema during this time was rated as severe, moderate, mild, and negligible
by 31.3%, 46.4%, 20.5%, and 1.8% of patients, respectively. The mean (SD) number of days
with angioedema during the previous 6 months was 33.5 (64.0). In 90% of patients who had

wheals and angioedema, the development of wheals and angioedema coincided.

Inducible urticaria is a common comorbidity of H1-antihistamine-refractory

CSU

ClndU was the most common comorbidity of H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU, occurring in
24% of CSU patients. ClndU was the secondary diagnosis for 86.4% of CSU patients with
comorbid ClndU; only 11.1% had a primary diagnosis of ClndU. Symptomatic
dermographism (12.3%), delayed pressure urticaria (6.1%) and heat urticaria (4.3%) were

the most common types of ClndU reported.

Other frequently reported comorbidities included allergic rhinitis (18.2%), hypertension
(18.1%), asthma (12%), depression (9.5%), obesity (8.1%), food allergies (7.9%), atopic
dermatitis (6.8%), Hashimoto's thyroiditis (5.9%), nut allergies (5.8%), and anxiety (4.7%;

H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU patients are undertreated

Only 57.6% of patients were receiving treatment for CSU at this baseline assessment
(58.8% of patients with UCT scores <12 and 56.1% of patients with UCT scores 212): 46.3%
of patients were receiving the recommended first line treatment for CSU, i.e. second
generation H1-antihistamines, 9.1% were receiving first generation H1-antihistamines and

15.8% were receiving corticosteroids (including prednisolone; Table 3).

Rates of pharmacological treatments were usually higher in hospital center compared to
local dermatologist treated patients: any treatment, 65.8% versus 54.7%, respectively;
second generation H1-antihistamines, 55.9% versus 42.9%; ranitidine, 5.7% versus 1.1%;
montelukast, 11.2% versus 1.0%; omalizumab, 6.0% versus 0.8%; and cyclosporine, 2.7%
versus 0.9%. Rates of treatment with prednisolone (11.7% versus 11.6%, respectively),
dapsone (2.2% versus 1.1%), and other corticosteroids (3.2% versus 4.6%) were similar in

both treatment settings,

CSU frequently leads to a marked impairment in QoL

Analysis of PROs revealed that CSU negatively impacts patient QoL. The mean (SD) DLQI
score was 8.3 (6.9; n = 1489), and for 32.8% of patients the symptoms of CSU had a very
large or extremely large impact on their QoL. For a further 29.2%, symptoms had a

moderate impact on QoL.

The mean (SD) total score for the CU-Q,0L was 36.2 (20.1; n = 1468). The most severely
impaired subdomains of the CU-Q,oL were itching/embarrassment (mean, 48.2; SD, 26.1),
sleep (mean, 45.2; SD, 27.3) and mental status (mean, 41.4; SD, 26.5). Mean scores for
overall functioning (mean, 32.2; SD, 25.8), swelling/eating (mean, 22.6; SD, 22.1) and limits

looks (mean, 26.4; SD, 27.1) indicated lower levels of impairment (Figure 1A).

In CSU patients with angioedema, the mean (SD) total AE-QoL score was 46.8 (22.2; n =

612). The most severely impaired subdomains were ‘fears/shame’ and ‘fatigue/mood’ with a

mean (SD) score of 54.5 (27.1) and 46.0 (26.0), respectively. The overall functioning (mean,
42.0; SD, 29.3) and nutrition (mean, 34.4; SD, 33.0) subdomains were less severely

impacted (Figure 1B).

H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU patients frequently use several healthcare

resources

H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU patients reported frequent use of healthcare resources:
29.7% of CSU patients had visited emergency services, on average (SD) 3 times (6.4) since
their CSU started; 30.3% reported hospitalization, on average (SD) 2.3 times (3.9); 71.9%
had visited a general practitioner, on average (SD) 7.9 times (12.5); 50.7% had visited a
dermatologist or allergist other than the study-enrolling dermatologist, on average (SD) 8.1
times (24.6); and 32.5% of patients had visited specialized urticaria centers, on average
(SD) 7.2 times (12.5). Patients also reported visiting ear, nose and throat specialists (35.3%
of patients; 1.7 visits), dentists (85.7% of patients; 1.7 visits), alternative practitioners (4% of

patients; 8.9 visits) and using other healthcare resources (19.7% of patients; 2.8 visits).

Discussion

The AWARE study will eventually present a comprehensive real-life data collection
describing the impact of available CSU therapies over time and their impact on healthrelated QoL, as well as the economic burden of CSU patients. This initial analysis reveals
that German H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU patients, treated by office-based
dermatologists or urticaria centers, display high rates of angioedema and comorbid ClndUs,
are undertreated, have impaired health-related QoL and frequently use multiple healthcare

resources.

The demographic characteristics reported in this observational study are comparable to
previously published expert [13, 14] and trial data [15-17]; a higher proportion of patients
were female, and age and BMI values were similar to those in previous literature [15, 16, 1821]. Angioedema is a major burden for affected patients and can severely impact patient
QoL [12]. The exact proportion of CSU patients who experience angioedema remains
unclear, with previous publications reporting rates ranging from 33% [13] to 55% [15-18]. In
this AWARE patient cohort, over 40% of patients experienced angioedema, of which 77.7%
were rated to be of severe or moderate intensity. This data confirms that a high proportion of
H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU patients experience angioedema, which is likely to have an

additional negative impact on patient QoL.

While previous literature suggests that CSU and ClndU can occur in parallel [2], the
frequency of such an occurrence had until now remained largely unknown. This study
indicates that approximately 25% of H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU patients have
comorbid ClndU. Consistent with previous publications, other comorbidities in this patient
population included asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, allergies, and autoimmune

diseases [13, 22-28].

Patients with CSU and other dermatological conditions are often reported to have an
increased risk of psychiatric comorbidities, with rates of depression and anxiety ranging
between 11-21% and 25-30% in CSU patients, respectively [21, 29-33]. In this AWARE
patient cohort, the rates of diagnosed anxiety (4.7%) and depression (9.5%) were only
slightly higher than prevalence rates previously reported in the German population [31, 34,
35]. A possible explanation for the lower rates of psychiatric comorbidities in this study may
be that different definitions of depression or anxiety were used. Furthermore, only patients
with an existing diagnosis of depression or anxiety were reported in this study, whereas
other studies have used validated psychometric tests, which can reveal previously
undiagnosed conditions [29]. The high proportion of CSU patients who are female and over

40 years may also represent a confounding factor when comparing the prevalence of

psychiatric comorbidities in CSU patients to that of the general population [36]. The patient
population may also differ from previously published CSU data, as patients were treated by

office-based dermatologists or urticaria centers.

The current urticaria guidelines recommend that physicians should aim for complete
symptom control when treating CSU [1]. Second generation H1-antihistamines are
recommended as the first-line treatment, increasing doses of second generation H1antihistamines as the second-line treatment, and finally the approved omalizumab and offlabel options ciclosporine A or montelukast as the third-line treatment [1]. These guidelines
also recommend against the long-term use of corticosteroids or the use of first generation
H1-antihistamines. In the current study, only 58% of patients were receiving pharmacological
treatment for CSU at the time of baseline documentation, despite having been diagnosed
with H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU for an average of 4.8 years and continuing to
experience symptoms. Moreover, less than 50% of patients were receiving the
recommended first-line treatment (second generation H1-antihistamines). Nearly 10% of
patients were receiving first generation H1-antihistamines, which are not recommended for
the treatment of CU. Furthermore, 15.8% were receiving corticosteroid treatment, which is
only recommended for a short course (maximum 10 days) treatment if exacerbations
demand it [1]. As it was unexpected that CSU-patients would be without any treatment, no
item was included in the structured data acquisition on why they were not taking any
medication at the time of enrollment. Therefore, we can only hypothesis that this is due to
lack of efficacy with previous H1-antihistamine treatment or is a result of treating physicians

avoiding off-label therapies.

In line with low rates of treatment, approximately 75% of patients had uncontrolled urticaria
(UCT score < 12), mean patient-reported satisfaction with current therapy was low (5.4
points out of 10 using VAS), and CSU had a negative impact on the patients QoL. A high
proportion of patients also reported absence from work due to uncontrolled CSU since

symptoms first appeared, which further highlights the burden of CSU for patients. These high

rates of under treatment, high rates of non-recommended treatment usage, low levels of
symptom control, and low levels of patient satisfaction highlight the need for improved

patient care and adherence to the current S3-CU guidelines.

In line with this above observation, healthcare resource usage was high in the AWARE
population; roughly 30% of CSU patients had visited the emergency room and 30% required
hospitalization since their symptoms first started. Increased rates of healthcare resource
utilization have recently been reported for CU patients from the United States and Europe
[19, 37]. In addition to the discomfort associated with these visits, the economic burden to

the healthcare services is likely to be considerable.

Limitations of the data are mainly driven through the nature of a NIS design. Data
completeness and quality as well as questionnaires filled out by patients are highly
dependent on the documentation accuracy of participating patients and physicians. As no
control population was included in the study, rates of healthcare resource use and
comorbidities can only be compared to previously reported rates. This somewhat limits the
strength of conclusions, as confounding factors cannot be accounted for. However, the
relatively large number of patients, from both specialized centers and office-based
dermatologists, included in this assessment provides an unmatched insight into the baseline
clinical characteristics of German adult patients with H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU.
Prospectively, this NIS will also allow us to gather data on the efficacy of different therapy
schedules used and their impact on the socio-economic burden of controlled versus

uncontrolled CSU patients.

In summary, the initial baseline analysis from the AWARE study reveals a high unmet need
of H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU patients in specialized CU centers as well as the officebased dermatology space. The majority of CSU patients were undertreated, had
uncontrolled urticaria and moderately or largely affected QoL. This study highlights the
impact of CSU on patient QoL and the need for improved patient care and adherence to the

latest treatment guidelines.
