ABSTRACT

Objectives: There are limited data regarding omalizumab in the treatment of recalcitrant chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in Asian populations. This study evaluated the effectiveness and the proper dosage of
omalizumab for Asian CSU patients in a real-life setting.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed recalcitrant CSU patients seeking treatment at the Skin Allergy
Clinic, Siriraj Hospital during the 3-year period. All patients were treated with omalizumab as an add-on
therapy. Standard seven-day urticaria activity score (UAS7) and medication score were used to assess omalizumab response.

Results: Of 13 patients, 9 patients (70%) responded well to 150mg omalizumab injection every month,
whereas 4 patients requiring updosing to 300mg. In the 150mg group, one patient achieved complete
symptom control without antihistamine intake. Most of them required antihistamines without prednisolone
and ciclosporin. Onset of omalizumab was fast, usually within the first week. Though only two patients in
the 300mg group achieved complete absence of symptoms, ciclosporin and oral corticosteroids could be
discontinued. No patients reported adverse effects.

Conclusions: Omalizumab at an initial dosage of 150mg was effective in the treatment of recalcitrant CSU

Introduction

Omalizumab, monoclonal anti-immunoglobulin E (anti-lgE) antibodies, is becoming recognized as the treatment of choice in
recalcitrant chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) patients who do
not respond to conventional therapy (1). A phase Ill, randomized,
double-blind study by Maurer et al. showed that both 150mg and
300mg omalizumab dosages were effective in the treatment of
CSU (2). The 300mg dosage showed more improvement in weekly
itch severity scores and 7-day consecutive urticaria activity score
(UAS7) than the 150mg omalizumab dosage. The number of
angioedema-free days from week 4 to week 12 differed significantly only in the 300 mg group.

There are several reports regarding the efficacy of omalizumab
treatment in patients with recalcitrant chronic urticaria (CU) (3,4).
Dosages of omalizumab in these case series were between
150mg and 300mg for each injection. Given the high cost of
omalizumab, Metz et al. proposed an initial injection dosage of
150mg omalizumab in clinical practice, regardless of body weight
and circulating IgE levels (1). At 4 weeks after injection, the dosage can be increased to 300mg if patients do not achieve good
response. Using this protocol, Metz et al. found that 15 of 21
CSU patients achieved complete remission (UAS7=0) with
150mg _ omalizumab injection, with only 5 patients requiring
updosing.

Based on our review of the literature, there has been no
published report concerning the use of omalizumab to treat
CSU among an Asian population that may have differences in

immunogenetics and average body weight, as compared to
Caucasians (5,6). This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of omalizumab in the treatment of recalcitrant CSU in a
real-life setting and to assess the proper omalizumab dosage for
Asian CSU patients.

Material and methods

This study was approved by the Siriraj Institutional Review Board
(SIRB), Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University,
Bangkok, Thailand. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of
recalcitrant CSU patients who visited the Skin Allergy Clinic,
Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital,
Mahidol University between 2013 and 2016. A recalcitrant CSU
patient was defined as a patient who has uncontrolled CSU, despite standard treatment with 4-times updosed non-sedating antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, oral corticosteroids,
and ciclosporin (7). All patients in our study received omalizumab
as an add-on therapy. Demographic data and laboratory investigations, including total serum IgE levels by nephelometry method
(BN ProSpec®, Dade Behring, Inc., Deerfield, IL) were studied. Total
serum IgE levels were collected at baseline and at 4 weeks and 8
weeks after the initial omalizumab injection. We used standard
UAS7 score and medication score to assess omalizumab response
(8,9). Scores from the validated Thai versions of the Dermatology
Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire and Chronic Urticaria
Quality of Life Questionnaire (CU-Q,oL) were analyzed before and
after omalizumab injection (10-13).

Disease severity assessment

UAS7 quantifies the daily number of wheals (range: 0-none to 3severe) and daily severity of pruritus (range: O-none to 3-severe)
for 7 consecutive days, with a maximum sum score of 42 [8]. UAS7
severity classifications are, as follows: severe [28-42], moderate
[16-27], mild [7-15], well-controlled [1-6], and complete response
[0]. UAS7 scores were recorded and calculated by each patient
during the seven-day period just prior to each visit.

In addition to UAS7, the medication scoring system proposed
by Sussman, et al. as a quantitative severity measurement in CSU
was also used in this study (9). The score is calculated based on
the sum total of drugs used, as follows: antihistamines (2 points,
regular dose; 8 points, up to four-fold dose), oral corticosteroids
(<11mg, 5 points; 11-25mg, 10 points; >25mg, 15 points), ciclosporin (>3 mg/kg/day, 8 points), hydroxychloroquine (6 points),
and leukotriene receptor antagonist (2 points).

Omalizumab treatment

Indications

According to the Thai Clinical Practice Guideline for Urticaria

(2015), omalizumab is considered to be an “add-on therapy” with

concomitant antihistamines in treatment-recalcitrant CSU patients.

Due to the high cost, the recommendation is to start omalizumab

in a stepwise manner, as follows:

i. he first step of CSU treatment should be initiated with a
standard dose of non-sedating H,-antihistamine;

ii. If symptoms persist after 2-4 weeks of regular dose of non
sedating H,-antihistamine, the dosage of non-sedating Hj
antihistamine can be increased up to 4-fold or different types
of non-sedating Hj-antihistamines can be used _ in
combination;

iii. If symptoms still persist after 2-4 weeks of treatment, leuko
triene receptor antagonist (montelukast), H2-antihistamines,

and/or short-course oral corticosteroids (oral corticosteroids
at a dose of <10 mg/day for less than 4 weeks) should be
added;

iv. If oral corticosteroids are needed for more than 4 weeks or
the patient develops side-effects from oral corticosteroids,
two options are available:

a. For patients who have ciclosporin contraindications,
omalizumab treatment should be considered as an
adjunctive therapy for patients with UAS7 scores >16,
despite background therapy according to the first three
steps of recommended treatment;

b. For patients who have no ciclosporin contraindications,
ciclosporin should be added at a dose of 3mg/kg/day.
Omalizumab treatment will be considered if the patient
has at least one of the following criteria:

v. Achieves less than 30% reduction in UAS7 after a 4-week
course of ciclosporin treatment (3 mg/kg/day);

vi. Develops ciclosporin side effects, such as renal impairment
or drug-induced hypertension (13-15);

vii. Could not discontinue ciclosporin after 3 months of treatment.

 

Administration and evaluation

Without considering either body weight or IgE levels, as in the
study by Metz et al. (1), the initial injection dose of omalizumab is
150mg, subcutaneously. At 4 weeks after the first injection,
150mg of omalizumab will be continued if patient has complete
remission (UAS7=0) or significant improvement (a reduction in
the UAS7 of 30-90%) (1). If there is no significant improvement

JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGICAL TREATMENT © 161

(<30% reduction in UAS7), updosing to 300mg of omalizumab
will be required. Response to treatment will be assessed every
month. In patients with good response, omalizumab (either
150 mg or 300mg) will be continued at 4-week intervals. An extension of the interval between omalizumab injections will be considered for complete responders. Discontinuation of omalizumab will
be evaluated at 3 months or 6 months in patients that have a
good response to omalizumab. In patients who do not achieve significant improvement (<30% reduction in UAS7) after increasing
omalizumab dosage from 150 to 300mg, omalizumab will be
discontinued.

Quality of life assessment

The validated Thai version of the DLQI and CU-Q2oL questionnaires that Kulthanan et al. received formal permission from Prof.
Dr. Andrew Y. Finlay and Dr. Ilaria Baiardini, respectively, were
used to evaluate at baseline and at week 12 after the first omalizumab injection (10-13).

Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed using PASW Statistics (formerly SPSS Statistics)
version 18.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).

Results

Thirteen recalcitrant CSU patients were enrolled in this study (5
males, 8 females). Demographic data of CSU patients is shown in
Table 1. At the beginning of omalizumab treatment, 10 patients
had UAS7 > 16, even though they had been treated in a stepwise
manner according to the guideline recommendation. One patient
(No.4) had well-controlled CSU (UAS7 =4); however, omalizumab
was initiated due to long-term use of ciclosporin (5 months).
Prolonged use of ciclosporin was unable to control CSU symptoms
in two patients (No.6, 7). One patient (No.3) had chronic kidney
disease, which contraindicated ciclosporin treatment. Accordingly,
omalizumab was administered to these 13 recalcitrant CSU
patients. The mean duration of disease before starting omalizumab
was 4.3+2.2 years.

Overall responses to omalizumab treatment are described in
Table 2. One month after the initial 150mg omalizumab injection,
UAS7 was assessed in all patients. Nine patients (9/13, 70%,
No.1-9) achieved a_ significant improvement in symptoms
(UAS7 <6). Of these 9 patients, 8 patients had complete response
CSU (UAS7=0) and one patient (1/9) had well-controlled CSU
(UAS7 <6). In the complete responder group, extension of duration between 150mg omalizumab injections ranged from 5 to 12
weeks. The other 4 patients (4/13, 30%, No.10-13) did not achieve
significant improvement by 150mg omalizumab injection. As a
result, updosing to 300mg omalizumab was required for the following injection. Though 2 patients (2/13, 15%, No.12,13) were
unable to achieve complete symptom control during omalizumab
treatment, they were able to discontinue prednisolone and ciclosporin. Patient No.11 had CSU with concomitant cold urticaria. The
5-min ice-cube-challenge test was positive at baseline. Follow-up
testing was performed after the 7th dosage of omalizumab injection and became negative. However, critical temperature threshold
measurement was not performed. One patient (No.12) discontinued omalizumab treatment after 5 injections due to an inability to
afford the cost of the medication. There were no significant differences in mean body weight between those who received 150mg
and those who received 300mg _ omalizumab _ injections
(60.3 + 13.5kg and 67.3+8.4kg, respectively; p = 0.364) (Table 1).

For the 10 items of the DLQI, the largest reduction in weighted
mean score was observed for item 1 (pruritus symptom, 2.3-0.6;
p=0.002) and the smallest reduction was observed for item 9
(sexual difficulty, 0.2-0.1, p=0.317). All 23 items of the CU-QjoL
had reductions in weighted mean score, with the most significant
change observed for item 1 (itching symptom, 2.7-0.8; p = 0.001).

Total serum IgE levels were investigated at baseline and at
weeks 4 and 8 after the initial omalizumab injection. Median levels
of total serum IgE at weeks 4 (659.51U/ml) and 8 (7661U/ml)
increased significantly, as compared to baseline (222.5 1U/ml)). No
adverse events and laboratory abnormalities (except changing of
total serum IgE levels) were detected among our patients during
omalizumab treatment.

Discussion

Dosage recommendation for omalizumab injection in asthma treatment is adjusted by body weight and total IgE levels (14).
However, omalizumab dosage recommendations for treatment of
CSU have not yet been conclusively established. Phase Ill randomized controlled trials in Caucasians (ASTERIA Il, ASTERIA |, and
GLACIAL) demonstrated that 300 mg omalizumab resulted in better
UAS7 outcome compared to 150mg omalizumab in treating recalcitrant CSU patients, regardless of body weight and total serum
IgE levels (Table 4) (2,15,16). The present study found that 70% of
recalcitrant CSU patients [9/13] responded well to 150mg omalizumab. Only 30% of patients [4/13] required updosing to 300mg
omalizumab. All patients who required 300 mg of omalizumab had
concomitant angioedema and one of them also had concomitant
cold urticaria. Data from the ASTERIA Il study and the European
Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human
Use (CHMP) suggests that CSU patients with angioedema might
require a 300mg dosage of omalizumab (2,17). Metz et al.
reported that omalizumab might be less effective in treating cold
urticaria and cholinergic urticaria (1).

The time interval between omalizumab injections was found to
differ from patient to patient (3). In this study, we attempted to
extend the interval between each omalizumab injection in patients
who achieved complete control of symptoms. Some patients were
still free of symptoms at 5-week to 8-week intervals between omalizumab injections, with one patient remaining asymptomatic for
more than 12 weeks after omalizumab injection without taking
any medications.

DLQI and CU-Q,0L questionnaires are acceptable tools for
assessing quality of life in CSU patients (18). Maurer et al. reported
significant improvement in DLQI scores after 12 weeks of

 

omalizumab treatment (2). Similarly, ukoztiirk, et al. showed
improvement in all domains of CU-Q,oL after 24 weeks of omalizumab treatment (19). In this study, most items of DLQI and CUQ,oL showed significant score reductions after 12 weeks of treatment. Pruritus-related symptoms were reduced most significantly
in both weighted mean DLQI and CU-Q;0L scores.

Theoretically, omalizumab binds to free IgE and then lowers
free IgE levels. As a result, the binding of IgE to the FceRI on mast
cells and basophils is reduced (20). Our study showed that total
serum IgE levels of all 13 recalcitrant CSU patients were significantly increased at 4 and 8 weeks after the initial omalizumab
injection. This may be explained by reports from studies by Chang,
et al. and Lowe et al. who found that total IgE levels increase while
free IgE levels decrease after omalizumab treatment, resulting in
free IgE-omalizumab complexes with ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 2:1, 2:2, and
3:3 (21,22).

In conclusion, our study showed that omalizumab was effective
in the treatment of recalcitrant CSU in an Asian population. Most
of our patients had improvement in disease activity and quality of
life with an initial 150mg omalizumab injection. In some patients
whose symptoms persisted, updosing to omalizumab 300mg was
required to achieve the desired clinical outcome. Dose adjustment
to omalizumab 300mg is indicated in patients who have: (i) no
significant improvement after initial 150mg dose of omalizumab;
and/or, (ii) concomitant angioedema; and/or, (iii) concomitant
inducible urticaria. No patients in our study reported adverse
effects. However, further studies need to be conducted in a larger
number of patients with long-term follow-up to conclusively establish the proper dosage and recommended length of omalizumab
treatment in Asians.
