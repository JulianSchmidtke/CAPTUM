Background: The recommended treatment approach in chronic inducible urticarias (CIndU) is the same as
that for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). But there is a lack of controlled trials assessing efficacy of
available treatment options.
Objective: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of treatment algorithm recommended by the guidelines and
comparison of treatment responses in CIndU vs CSU.
Methods: This prospective parallel group controlled study included 70 CIndU and 66 CSU patients. The same
treatment algorithm recommended by the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology/
Global Allergy and Asthma European Network/European Dermatology Forum/World Allergy Organization
(EAACI/GA7LEN/EDF/WAO) was implemented to both CSU and CIndU patients. Treatment responses of the
groups were evaluated with urticaria control test (UCT) and dermatology life quality questionnaire (DLQI)
scores at the 0, 4, 8, 12 and 24th weeks for CIndU and 0, 4, 12 and 24 weeks for CSU.
Results: Fourteen patients (20,9%) with CIndU and 25 (37,9%) with CSU responded to standard doses of H1AHs which was significantly higher in the CSU group (p=0,031, p < 0,05). Patients with CIndU and CSU
showed statistically similar responses to 2nd line treatments (combining or updosing AHs) (p=0,979;
p> 0,05). Twenty-seven (40,3%) of CIndU patients and 21 (31,8%) of CSU patients were diagnosed as AHresistant urticaria. Omalizumab was administered to 15 CSU patients and 17 CIndU patients. Response rates
to omalizumab were similar in both groups. Total response rates increased from 37,9% (n:25) to 68,2%
(n:45) with the 2nd line treatments in CSU group while it increased from 20,9% (n:14) to 59,7% (n:40) in
CIndU group. When omalizumab was introduced to AH-refractory cases as a 3rd line treatment, total
response rates evaluated at the 12th week were 76,1% (n:51) in patients with CIndU and 83,3% (n:55) in CSU.
Continuing omalizumab treatment for 24 weeks increased response rates in patients who were
unresponsive at week 12.
Conclusion: CIndU seem to be more resistant to standard doses of AHs and higher doses of AHs are required
for the control of symptoms. The same guidelines for CSU may be implemented to patients with CIndU.

triggers like cold, heat, sustained local pressure, vibration, sunlight,

Chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU) is a subgroup of chronic water, and increased body temperature [1,2]. CIndUs are classified
urticaria (CU) which is characterized by wheals and/or angioedema into physical urticarias and otherinducible urticarias [1]. While

symptomatic dermographism (SD), heat and cold urticarias (ColdU),
delayed pressure urticaria (DPU), solar urticaria (SU), and vibratory
angioedema are in the group of physical urticarias, cholinergic
urticaria (CholU), contact urticaria, and aquagenic urticaria (AU) are
the other types of inducible urticarias | 1,3,4]. CIndUs occur alone but
may also occur in combination with other types of inducible
urticarias or chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) [2]. In rare cases
two or more triggers may be required to induce urticaria [1].
Diagnosis is made by exclusion of differential diagnosis i.e CSU with
patient’s history and performing specific skin provocation testing
[1,2,5]. Threshold testing of eliciting factors is also recommended
which is important for assessing disease activity and treatment
response [1,3]. It is also useful to determine the trigger threshold
which the patient has to avoid [1,3,6]. There are no specific disease
activity tools or quality of life (QoL) instruments for CIndU [2].
Although chronic urticaria QoL questionnaire exists for CSU, there
are no specific QoL instruments for SD, ColdU and CholU but these are
under development. For now, the Dermatology Life Quality Index
(DLQI) can be used for assessing QoL in patients with CIndU [1,2]. If
threshold testing is not available, treatment response may be
evaluated with Urticaria Control Test (UCT). UCT is areliable new tool
for evaluating disease control in patients with CSU as well as CIndU
over the past 4 weeks [2,7].

Management of CIndU mainly aims to achieve complete
symptom control and trigger avoidance [1]. But trigger avoidance
is not always so simple. If avoidance of stimulus is not possible, the
first step of treatment is second generation H1 antihistamines (sgAHs) to achieve complete symptom control [5,8]. If symptoms
persist with standard dosing, the European Academy of Allergology
and Clinical Immunology/Global Allergy and Asthma European
Network/European Dermatology Forum/World Allergy Organization (EAACI/GA7LEN/EDF/WAO) Guideline recommends using the
same treatment algorithm for both CSU and CIndU which is
updosing of the sg-AHs up to 4-fold as a 2nd line treatment [5].
While combining different H1-antihistamines (AHs) at the same
time is not recommended by the EAACI/GA?LEN/EDF/WAO
guideline, Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP) and
British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI)
guideline recommends combining sg-AHs besides updosing them
as the 2nd step of treatment. Although there are some treatment
differences in AH-resistant cases between the guidelines, they all
include omalizumab treatment as the next step [5,8,9].

Recently the definition, diagnostic testing and management of
CIndU; the EAACI/GA?LEN/EDF/UNEV (urticaria network e.V.)
consensus recommendations 2016 update and revision has been
published [1]. Even though this update gives valuable information
on the diagnostic testing; treatment is based on primarily case
series or uncontrolled studies instead of high level of evidence
studies [1]. The reason for that is the lack of prospective controlled
studies on the treatment of CIndU.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment
algorithm recommended by the guidelines and comparison of
treatment responses in CIndU vs CSU.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Patient selection and data collection

This was a prospective, controlled, parallel group study which
included 70 CIndU patients whose diagnosis were confirmed by
provocation testing and 66 CSU patients over 16 years of age who
were referred to our Urticaria Clinic from January 2015 to August
2016. The patients who were on treatment other than standard
doses of H1-AHs at the time of referral were excluded from the
study, but three patients that were already on treatment with
omalizumab were only taken to consideration for demographic

evaluation but excluded from the treatment response evaluation.
The study was approved by Okmeydani Training and Research
Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB protocol approval
number: 48670771-514.10) and was conducted according to the
Declaration of Helsinki. All patients has given informed consent.

Sociodemographic characteristics including sex, age, disease
duration, accompanying angioedema and diagnosis of the patients,
the treatment that have been used for the last month were
evaluated in both groups.

The Turkish version of DLQI [10] and UCT were filled for CIndU
patients prospectively. The Turkish validation of UCT has been
performed by the author of this study (Kocaturk E) (the results
have not been published yet). The forward and backward
translation processes and cognitive debriefing of the Turkish
version has been done and changes to the original tool has been
made according to patients’ remarks. These changes have been
endorsed by the creator of the original tool (Weller K). UCT has 4
questions and each question has 5 answer options which are
scored between 0 and 4 points. Total UCT scores were calculated by
summing all 4 individual item scores (0-16 points). While a total
score of 16 indicates complete disease control and 0 indicates no
control, a score of >12 indicates well-controlled urticaria and a
score of <12 points indicates poor controlled disease [7].

2.2. Treatment design

Patients on standard doses of H1-AHs at least for 2 weeks
duration were included to the study. Treatment modality was
determined prospectively according to the UCT scores of CIndU
patients. UCT scores were assessed at the 1st visit and patients
with UCT scores of >12 and <12 were accepted as responders and
non-responders, respectively. Patients who had a UCT score of <12
with standard doses of H1-AHs were treated either with
combination of two different sg-AHs (combination group:
levocetirizine 5 mg/day plus rupatadine 10 mg/day) or updosing
sg-AHs up to 4-folds (updosing group: ebastine 40 mg/day). The
patients with a UCT score of >12 continued with the standard
doses of sg-AHs. At the 2nd visit (4 weeks after the 1st visit)
patients with UCT scores of <12 in the combination group or
updosing group underwent omalizumab treatment alone without
AHs. The DLQI scores were also evaluated at the 1st and 2nd visits.
Response to treatment with omalizumab was assessed at the
following 4th, 8th, 12th and 24th weeks of the treatment.

In order to compare the treatment responses of CSU and CIndU,
UCT scores of CSU patients who underwent combination or
updosing treatment and omalizumab treatment were retrospectively reviewed from patient charts. Side effects and compliance to
treatment were noted.

2.3. Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed with NCSS (Number Cruncher Statistical System) 2007 (Kaysville, Utah, USA). Differences in
measured parameters (quantitative variables) between the groups
were analysed with nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test or
Kruskal-Wallis tests such as age, disease duration, mean scores of
DLQI of subtypes of CIndUs at the referral. Means and mean
changes in DLQI scores and UCT scores of CIndU and CSU groups
were analysed with Mann-Whitney U test. Friedman Test and
Wilcoxon test were used to compare the changes with skew
distribution. The levels of significance values for differences in the
median UCT and DLQI scores were calculated by Wilcoxon test. The
comparison of the qualitative variables such as gender, accompanying angioedema, adverse effects and compliances as well as the
comparison of response rates of treatment steps of CIndU and CSU
were analysed with Pearson’s chi-square test, Fisher’s Exact test

 
62 E. Kocatiirk et al. /Journal of Dermatological Science 87 (2017) 60-69

and Yates’ Continuity Correction. All data were reported as mean
value + standard deviation, median (25th-75th percentile), minimum, maximum, frequency and percentages. Statistical significance was achieved at p<0,05 and p<0,01. All analyses were
performed by using nonparametric methods.

3. Results
3.1. Patients

Seventy patients with CIndU (46 female and 24 male) and 66
patients (46 female and 20 male) with CSU were included in the
study. All demographic data are summarized in Table 1. Mean DLQI
scores of subtypes of CIndU were compared at the time of referral
and significant differences were observed between the subtypes
(p=0,043; p<0,05, Kruskal Wallis Test). Mean scores of the DLQI
were highest in patients with CholU (14,29 + 8,36), followed by
combined CIndUs (11,00+6,78), SD (8,32 +6,44) and lowest in
patients with ColdU (3,83 + 4,07). The difference was statistically
significant only when the mean DLQI of CholU was compared with
ColdU (p=0,022; p < 0,05) while other subtype comparisons were
not statistically significant (p>0,05, Mann Whitney U Test).

3.2. Responses to first line treatment: evaluation of the response to
standard doses of AH

The patients with CIndU were evaluated at the 1st visit by
means of response to standard doses of H1-AHs and 3 patients who

CIndU Subtypes (n=70)

were already under treatment with omalizumab at baseline were
excluded from the study. A total of 67 CIndU patients and 66 CSU
patients were eligible for the analysis. The spectrum of treatments
taken by the patients in both groups at 1st visit was shown in Fig. 1.

UCT scores were calculated for each patient by the physician
(Table 2). When the responses of subtypes of CIndU were
evaluated, 21,3% (n: 10) of the patients with SD, and 50% (n:3)
of the ColdU patients showed response to standard doses of H1AHs. While only one of the seven patients with CholU showed
response, none of the patients with combined CIndU showed
response to standard doses of H1-AHs. A patient with AU also did
not achieve control with standard dose of an H1-AH.

3.3. Evaluation of responses to second line treatment: updosing and
combination of two different second generation antihistamines

Fifty three patients (79,1%) with CIndU and 41 patients (62,1%)
with CSU who did not achieve disease control (UCT < 12) with
standard doses of H1-AHs underwent either combination of two
different sg-AHs (levocetirizine 5 mg/day plus rupatadine 10 mg/
day) or updosing of sg-AH (up to 4 times) (ebastine 40 mg/day)
(n= 28 vs 25 in CIndU, n=7 vs 34 in CSU). There were no significant
differences with regard to treatment responses to updosing of sgAH between the CSU and CindU patients (p=0,523; p> 0,05, Yates’
Continuity Correction Test). Response rates to 2nd line treatments
were similar between CIndU and CSU groups (p=0,979; p>0,05,
Pearson x? test) (Table 2).

3.4, Evaluation of response to omalizumab treatment as the third line
treatment

Twenty-seven of 67 (40,3%) CIndU patients and 21 of 66 (31,8%)
CSU patients were diagnosed as AH-resistant urticaria. But 15 CSU
patients and 17 CIndU patients (10 patients with SD, 2 with CholU,
2 with ColdU, 2 with combined CIndU and 1 with AU) were treated
with omalizumab (150mg every 2 weeks or 300mg every 4
weeks). The missing number of patients (10 of CIndU and 6 of CSU
patients) is due to patients’ unwillingness for omalizumab therapy
or quitting follow-up. Ten (58,8%) patients with CIndU gained well
control of their symptoms at week 4 while 13 (76,5%) patients at
week 8, 11 patients (64,7%) at week 12 responded to treatment. 13/
15 patients in CSU group and 14/17 patients in CIndU group
continued follow-up until 24th week of omalizumab treatment.
Eleven (78,6%) patients in CIndU group responded to omalizumab
treatment at week 24 (Fig. 2).

While 6 of the 7 SD patients responded to omalizumab
treatment, all patients with combined CIndU (n:2), one of two
ColdU and one of two CholU patients and AU patient responded to
treatment with omalizumab at week 24.

Increases in the mean UCT scores and decreases in the mean
DLQI scores between baseline and 4th, 8th, 12th and 24th weeks
were significant in CIndU (Fig. 3,Tables 3 and 4).

Patients with CSU showed similar response rates to omalizumab treatment as patients with CIndU (Fig. 4). Ten patients (66,7%)
with CSU responded to treatment at week 12, while 11 (84,6%)
responded at week 24. There were no significant differences
observed between the means of UCT scores and mean changes in
UCT scores from the baseline to week 12 and 24 between CIndU
and CSU groups (p>0,05, Mann Whitney U Test) (Table 4). But
continuing omalizumab treatment for 24 weeks increased the
response rates in patients who were unresponsive at week 12
(Fig. 5). When the response rates of CIndU patients were evaluated
in detail; the mean DLQI scores of 17 patients with CIndU
decreased from 12,12+8,05 to 4,18+4,39 (p:0,002; p<0,01,
Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test) while UCT scores increased significantly from 6,71+2,66 to 12,24+3,56 at week 12 (p: 0,001;
p<0,01, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test). At follow up, since three
patients left the study, we had 14 patients to evaluate the
responses. We included the results of these 14 patients for 24 week
response evaluation. The UCT scores statistically increased from

20,9% (n:14) to 59,7% (n:40) in CIndU group. When omalizumab
was introduced to AH-refractory cases as a 3rd line treatment, total
response rates evaluated at the 12th week were 76,1% (n:51) in
patients with CIndU and 83,3% (n:55) in CSU. At the 24th week

these rates reached to 80,6% (n:54) in CIndU and 87,9% (n:58) in
CSU (Fig. 6).

3.6. Side effects and compliance to treatments

Side effects of standard dose of H1-AHs used at referral were
questioned. Twenty-two (32,8%) patients with CIndU reported at
least one side effect. While sedation was reported by 25,4% (n:17)
of this 67 patients, gastric complaints and cognition impairment
had been reported by 2 patients. Dizziness, headache, weight gain
and nervousness were the other complaints reported. Sedation was
mostly reported with the use of levocetirizine [47,1% (n:8)]. Fourtynine patients (73,1%) showed good compliance to standart doses of
H1-AHs at referral. When the side effects were evaluated at the
second visit, 9 (32,1%) patients taking combination of sg-AHs and 5
(20%) patients taking updosed sg-AHs stated at least one side effect
but there were no significant differences between the groups
(p=0,491; p>0,05, Yates’ Continuity Correction Test). One of the
patients reported flu-like symptoms after each injection of
omalizumab. When the compliance to updosing (76%, n:19) and
combination (75%, n:21) of sg-AHs compared, there were also no
differences between the two groups (p>0,05, Yates’ Continuity
Correction Test).

4. Discussion

Second-generation H1-AHs constitute the 1st line treatment in
both CSU and ClIndU, but only 4-56% of CU patients respond to
standard doses [5,8,9,11-15]. In a recent systematic review and
meta-analysis, response rates to standard doses of AHs was

reported in 38.6% (95% CI 34.7-42.7) of CSU patients [16]. Even
though there is a lack of data in the literature showing the
treatment responses, CIndU can be challenging to treat with the
standard doses of AHs [17]. In this study we demonstrated that
patients with CIndU respond poorer than patients with CSU to
standard doses of sg-AHs (20,9% vs 37,9%). This is a common
observation by urticaria experts but has not been reported
elsewhere.

When the standard doses of sg-AHs fails, second step in the
EAACI/GA7LEN/EDF/WAO guideline is increasing the dosage up to 4
folds [5]. In most cases of CIndU, updosing is required to prevent
the symptoms [18]. Higher dosages of sg-AHs are superior to
standard dosages and they are also safe to use [4].

We wondered if responses to updosing would be different in the
CIndU group than the CSU group and found that response rates to
updosing in the CSU and CIndU groups were not significantly
different from each other; even though the response rates to
standard doses were very poor in the CIndU group. There are
numerous studies showing efficacy of updosing in CSU [19-24], as
well as different types of CIndU [25-30] but a comparison has not
been performed between CSU and CIndU before.

High doses of AHs have been reported to be effective in about
45%-50% of patients with CSU [31], and response rates increase
from 45% up to more than 60% with the updosing of sg-AHs [32]. A
systematic review and meta-analysis showed that response rate to
updosing sg-AHs was 63.2% (95% CI 57-69.6%) in CSU [16]. We
determined that total response rates increased from 37,9% to 68,2%
with the second step of the treatment in the CSU group while it
increased from 20,9% to 59,7% in CIndU group. Increasing
antihistamine doses whether with updosing or combination

showed an undisputed efficacy and increased quality of life in both
groups; and this increase was very prominent in the CIndU group.

Safety and drug interactions are the common concerns of the
combination therapies or updosing of AHs although there are trials
showing the safety of updosing AHs [19,20,28,29,33-35]. Ebastine
was shown to be effective and safe at high doses in CSU [22] while

20 mg doses of ebastine was shown to be effective and safe in the
patients with SD [25]. We did not observe in our cohorts any side
effects that were significantly different between combination and
updosing of sg-AHs.

refractory cases include short-term corticosteroids, add-on therapy with cyclosporine, LTRA or omalizumab in the EAACI/GA?LEN/
EDF/WAO guideline [5]. In 2014, omalizumab was approved by the
FDA for AH-refractory CSU patients [39,40] and it was recommended by JTFPP, EAACI/GA?LEN/EDF/WAO and BSACI guidelines
due to its efficacy and safety [5,8,9]. Efficacy of omalizumab for CSU
has been shown by placebo controlled clinical trials [39,40-45],
while there are just case reports and case series in the literature for
CIndU [11,17,46-50]. There are on-going trials evaluating the
efficacy of omalizumab in different types of CIndU which have not
been published yet [CUTEX (NCT01580592), UFO (NCT02169115),
XOLUS (NCT02262130), CUN-OMAL-UCOL (NCT02012387)]. In the
current study 40,3% of CIndU patients and 31,8% CSU patients were
AH-refractory and were given omalizumab treatment.

In a retrospective clinical analysis complete remission was
achieved in 83% of CSU and 70% of CIndU patients by the
administration of omalizumab. Patients with CIndU showed
similar response rates with CSU patients to omalizumab [11].
Another cohort showed that 90% of patients with CSU responded to
treatment while 53% of CIndU had a complete or almost complete
response to treatment [46]. In our study, 64,7% CIndU and 66,7%
CSU patients responded to omalizumab at week 12 while these
rates increased to 78,6% in CIndU and 84,6% in CSU at week 24. This
shows that treatment responses to omalizumab was similar in the
CSU and CIndU groups and continuing omalizumab treatment for
24 weeks may increase response rates in patients who were
unresponsive at week 12.

In recent reports; DPU and SD were found to be more
responsive while patients with ColdU and CholU seem to be less
responsive to omalizumab treatment [11]. In a case series, three of
five patients with DPU; two of five patients with ColdU; three of
four patients with CholU and one of two patients with SD showed
response, patient with SU had no response to treatment [46]. In our

series, SD patients (6/7) and combined CIndU (2/2) showed the
best response to treatment with omalizumab while one of two
ColdU and CholU patients responded to omalizumab treatment at
week 24. While a patient with AU did not respond to omalizumab
treatment at week 12, same patient responded to treatment at
week 24.

Total response rates increased from 37,9% (n:25) to 68,2 (n:45)
with the 2nd line treatments in CSU group while it increased from
20,9% (n:14) to 59,7% (n:40) in CIndU group. When omalizumab
was introduced to AH-refractory cases as a 3rd line treatment, total
response rates evaluated at the 12th week were 76,1% (n:51) in
patients with CIndU and 83,3% (n:55) in CSU. At the 24th week
these rates reached to 80,6% (n:54) in CIndU, 87,9% (n:58) in CSU.

These findings suggest that updosing/combining antihistamines as well as adding omalizumab markedly increases
response rates in CIndU.

5. Limitations of the study

Limitations of our study are 1. The design of CIndU group is
prospective while CSU is retrospective. 2. In the second step
treatments, we used levocetirizine plus rupatadine as the
combination of sg-AH group while we used ebastine four-folds
as the updosing group. These treatment groups were not
appropriate to compare, that is why a comparison of combination
and updosing of antihistamines could not be carried out. 3. When
the patients reached the third line treatment, 10 of 27 CIndU
patients and 6 of 21 CSU patients could not be enrolled because of
unwillingness of getting omalizumab or quitting follow-up, loss of
5 more patients at the 24th week evaluation could have effected to
total response rates. 4. Although omalizumab is recommended as
an add-on therapy, we gave omalizumab alone without antihistamines. The reason for this was; at the beginning of our study we
68

E. Kocatiirk et al. /Journal of Dermatological Science 87 (2017) 60-69

started omalizumab with antihistamines but we later realised that
the patients quitted taking their antihistamines. Because of this we
had to treat other consequent patients as the same way with the
former patients. That is why we gave omalizumab alone without
antihistamines. The response rates would be higher in Figs. 4 and 5
if omalizumab and antihistamines were given together.

6. Conclusion

Although the response rates to first line treatment is lower than

CSU, patients with CIndU showed similar response rates to 2nd and
3rd line treatments as CSU patients. In conclusion, the same
guidelines for CSU may be implemented to patients with CIndU.
