ABSTRACT

Introduction. Chronic idiopathic/spontaneous urticaria (CIU/CSU) is a dermatological condition
characterized by itchy wheals and/or angioedema of continuous or intermittent duration of 26 weeks with
a high burden of disease and impact on quality of life. Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized
monoclonal antibody that inhibits the binding of IgE to high affinity receptors, and is approved for the
CIU/CSU indication. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate and synthesize the evidence

on the real-world effectiveness of omalizumab in CIU/CSU in daily clinical practice.

Areas Covered. This review of 84 observational effectiveness studies covers treatments (dosing,

medication use), clinical outcomes (treatment response, disease activity, quality of life), and safety.

Expert Opinion. The clinical outcomes observed across studies underscore the*real-world effectiveness of
omalizumab in the management of CIU/CSU. Continued treatment may assist,patients showing an initial
response to achieve a complete treatment response. Response rates,are aligned with observed changes
in disease activity, symptom experience, and quality of life, and this across subtypes of CIU/CSU. The
positive therapeutic profile is complemented by a positive safety profile. The real-world evidence
summarized here points convincingly at the high degree of effectiveness of omalizumab in the treatment

of CIU/CSU in daily clinical practice.
1.0 INTRODUCTION

Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), also known as chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), is a dermatological
condition characterized by itchy wheals and/or angioedema of continuous or intermittent duration of 6
weeks or longer. CIU/CSU is a subtype of chronic urticaria (CU) and is differentiated from inducible forms
of CU (CindU) in that CIU/CSU has no known external trigger [1,2,3]. The incidence of CU in the general
population has been estimated at 1.4% per year with a prevalence ranging from 0.5% to 5% [1]#Point
prevalence of CIU/CSU at any time in Europe is estimated to be 0.5 to 1% [4] while the one-year
prevalence of CIU/CSU in a commercially insured US population of 5.8 million was 0.11% [5]. Women are

disproportionately affected by approximately 2:1 [5,6,7].

The number, size, character, and duration of wheal flares affect symptom severity..Burden of disease
associated with CIU/CSU can be significant and debilitating, even when treated, interms of patientreported symptoms (primarily pruritus); quality of life including sleep problems and physical limitations;
and adverse impact on daily activities and work attendance and performance. In a recent 7-country
observational study [7], magnitude of burden across all of these parameters positively correlated with
disease severity. Cost of work productivity loss per month was estimated to range from US$545+$603 in
France to US$1,287+$1,124 in Germany. Direct CSU-related healthcare costs per patient year (in 2014)
were found to range from US$907+$2,431 in Italy to US$2,984+8,969 in France. Broder et al. [5] similarly
assessed resource utilization of patients with CIU/CSU (n=6,350) in a US population and found that mean
urticaria-related healthcare cost in 2012 totaled. $997+$2,322 per person (median $612). For comparison,
annual per person expenditures for other commonly treated conditions in 2013 included $728 for
hyperlipidemia, $776 for hypertension,$1;792 for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma, and
$2,565 for diabetes mellitus [8].

Urticarial wheals occur when mast cell activation results in release of proinflammatory mediators, such as
histamine, leukotrienes,and platelet-activating factor among others. Mast cell activation may be triggered
by such factors:as antigens, autoantibodies, neuropeptides, hormones, medications, physical stimuli,
venoms, and,radiocontrast media [9], yet the mechanisms of mast cell activation and pathogenesis in
CIU/CSU are not thoroughly understood [10,11,12]. While the formation of autoantibodies (e.g., against
the FcéR1 alpha subunit of the high-affinity IgE receptor or the thyroid, among others) may be a factor in
a subset of CIU/CSU patients, only about half of CIU/CSU patients have some type of autoimmunity
[13,14]. Hence, chronic autoimmune urticaria (CAU) is considered a subtype of CIU/CSU [1,15,12].

Historically, non-sedating H1 antihistamine (nsAH) monotherapy has been the first-line treatment for CU
[9,16] followed by nsAH up-dosing, then adding either an H2-blocker, a leukotriene antagonist, oral
corticosteroids, cyclosporine, or immunomodulators among other alternative treatments [16]. Omalizumab

(Xolair®, Novartis), a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits binding of IgE to highaffinity receptors, was first approved in Australia in 2002, followed in 2003 by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), and in 2005 by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of
moderate to severe persistent allergic asthma. Omalizumab binds to free IgE, preventing IgE from binding
to IgE receptors thereby triggering a cellular down-regulation of IgE receptors (FceR1); however, the
mechanism by which these effects of omalizumab result in improvement of CIU/CSU symptoms is
unknown [17]. Following publication of early case reports and case series documenting the effectiveness
of off-label use of omalizumab for CU, CIU, and CAU [18,19,20,21,22], omalizumab emerged as an
optional fourth level treatment (albeit based on low level evidence) in the 2009 international guidelines on
urticaria management [15]. Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase Ill:trials [23j24,25]

subsequently demonstrated efficacy and safety of omalizumab in CIU/CSU.

Omalizumab was approved by the EMA in February 2014 for CSU and by the FDA in March 2014 for CIU
in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older who remain symptomatic despite nsAH treatment.
Antihistamines remain the first-line treatment for CIU/CSU with omalizumab currently recommended as
Step 4 by the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters in the US [1,14] and as third-line treatment in
international guidelines [3]. The published body of evidence on omalizumab effectiveness in daily clinical
practice for CIU/CSU has since grown. In line with our prior systematic review of 24 observational studies
on omalizumab in adult patients with severe allergic asthma [26], we report here on a systematic review
of 84 publications including case reports/series and observational studies of the real-world effectiveness
of omalizumab for treatment of CIU/CSU. The objective was to synthesize the evidence on the real-world
effectiveness of omalizumab in CIU/CSU; that is, under conditions of greater heterogeneity in patients,
treatment patterns, and clinicians than typically seen in randomized controlled efficacy trials. Our review is
intended to provide a comprehensive, critical, and rigorous synthesis of this body of evidence and to
provide an informed opinion on the use of omalizumab across the diverse patient phenotypes affected by
CIU/CSU. As a systematic review, it extends and updates the clinical and product reviews and summaries
on omalizumab in CIU/CSU published to date [27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36], and provides guidance to

clinicians.
2.0 METHODOLOGY

A protocol based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)

[37] guidance was developed and implemented.
2.1 Eligibility

Included in this systematic review were published real-world effectiveness studies of male or female
adults or adolescents (12 years or older) with CIU/CSU treated with omalizumab meeting the following
PRISMA-defined PICOS [37] criteria:

Participants: Male or female adults or adolescents (12 years or older) diagnosed with CIU/CSU
Intervention: Treated with omalizumab for CIU/CSU

Comparators: Permissible but not required

RON >

Outcomes: at least one measure of: treatment response, CIU/CSU disease activity (i.e.,
symptoms), quality of life, or safety.
5. Studies: any observational method including case reports, case series, registry, retrospective

chart review, prospective observational study, or pragmatic trials.
2.2 Search strategy, screening, and data extraction

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library database for published
articles. Keywords included “chronic idiopathic urticaria” or “chronic spontaneous urticaria”, and
“omalizumab. There were no restrictions on language, sample size or date of publication, however,
studies conducted prior to 2014 were considered off-label use. Studies as defined above were eligible if
published as original research, case report/series, review or letter (if other eligibility criteria were met).
While there have been a plethora of abstracts published on use of omalizumab in CIU/CSU from
immunology and/or dermatology congresses, abstract-only publications were not included due to lack of
sufficiently detailed data. The reference lists of sources were reviewed for studies not previously

identified. The search censoring date was 28 September 2017.

As shown in Figure 1, the database searches yielded 1,341 records and 5 additional records were
identified through citation analysis, for a total of 1,346. This total reduced to 871 after removal of 475
duplicates. Of these, 3 were not retrievable and 678 records were not relevant, resulting in 190 articles
retrieved for full-text review including publications in English, Dutch, German, Polish, and Spanish. Of
these, 29 included duplicate reporting of cases, 75 did not meet PICOS eligibility criteria, and 2 did not

sufficiently report the requisite treatment or outcome data.
This yielded the 84 studies mentioned above. The following study-level data were extracted: year of
publication, country, evaluable sample size, sample characteristics (demographics, relevant medical

history, CIU/CSU history, prior CIU/CSU treatments), omalizumab treatment patterns and outcomes.

Treatment response was generally reported in one of two ways: responder/non-responder or
complete/partial/no response. There was variation in timing of measurements (e.g., 1-week response, 1month response, 3-month, etc.) with the majority of studies reporting response at the end of the
observation period, which also varied across studies. We included for both response measurements:
whether patients showed an initial and/or a final treatment response. For final response measures, “nonresponder” and/or “no response” also included patients who may have had an initial response but

became refractory. A small subset of studies reported time to this response.
Disease activity outcomes encompassed ratings on either of the following scales:

1. Urticaria Activity Score (UAS) [38]: summed intensity rating of wheals and pruritus each ona
scale of 0 (no disease activity) to 3 (intense activity) over the course of one day.
UAS7 [38]: summed daily UAS over 7 consecutive days.
Urticaria Control Test (UCT) [39]:4-item survey to retrospectively assess urticaria control over a

4-week recall period.
Quality of life outcomes comprised data from the following scales:

1. Chronic Urticaria and Quality of Life Questionnaire (CU-Q20L) [40]
2. Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) [41]

Safety data were recorded as stated in the articles. This included singular adverse (AE) or serious
adverse events (SAE), but also combined safety entries (e.g., fatigue and mild pain in lower extremities).
We did not attempt to parse these out into singular occurrences. Neither did we attempt to classify AEs

and SAEs according to such systems as Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).

Medication use referred to whether other CIU/CSU treatments were continued or discontinued after
treatment with omalizumab was started. Methods for quantifying medication use comprised medication
scoring systems, medication count (mg or tablets) for routine or rescue medications, and combined

symptom and medication scoring systems.

Note that studies differed in terms of the clinical, safety, and outcomes measures included. We recorded

for each study the outcomes included in the study.

Screening and data extraction were performed independently by two investigators. Discrepancies were

resolved through discussion or, if not resolved, escalated to a third investigator for adjudication.
2.3 Other methodological considerations

When two or more studies containing the same subjects (either partially or wholly) were identified, the
larger study was retained. For example, an older case study on one or two subjects was excluded if a

more recent, larger publication contained these same subjects as part of a larger cohort.

A number of publications contained mixed samples with some CIU/CSU patients and some with CindU.
Where possible, the data on CIU/CSU subjects meeting our eligibility criteria were extracted and CindU
patients were censored. For this, we relied in first instance on stratified results reported in the publication.
Alternately, we censored specific cases based on raw data obtained from tables in the manuscript or
included in online supplemental materials. If this was not possible, we queried the authors to provide
either stratified results on the CIU/CSU patients only or for access to the raw data so that we could extract

the relevant cases.

Calculations in all papers were validated, data permitting, to assess data integrity and derive common
metrics for comparisons across studies. Hence, results in our analysis may diverge from originally
reported data if re-calculations were done using a different formula to permit cross-study comparisons or
for studies where cases were censored. When missing, means and standard deviations were imputed
from other measures of central tendency (median) and dispersion (either min/max or interquartile range)
when available and if the variable was reasonably expected of being normally distributed. The titrated
omalizumab dose was computed on patients remaining on omalizumab (i.e., denominator does not

include those discontinued).
2.4 Classification of studies by urticaria subtype
Based on the subtype of urticaria in focus, the 84 studies were classified into five categories.

1. The “C/U/CSU studies” category (n=21; 25.0%) includes investigations focused on patients
diagnosed specifically with CIU or CSU, with no mention of CindU
[42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51 ,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62]. Angioedema was an
allowable comorbidity, but patients could not have any other reported relevant comorbid
conditions.

2. The “CAU studies” category is comprised of three studies (3.6%) explicitly using the term chronic
autoimmune urticaria to describe the sample [21,22,63]. All three studies were published in or
prior to 2010. Since then, the term CSU has been used more frequently to characterize noninducible chronic urticaria whether autoimmune or non-autoimmune in nature, as proposed in the
international guidelines on classification of CU [3,15]. CAU (also known as auto-antibody
associated urticaria) is also regarded as a subcategory of CIU [12]. Hence, it is likely that had
these studies been published more recently, they would have used the term CIU or CSU.
However, for both historical and scientific reasons, we have assessed them as a separate cohort.
Six studies (7.1%) include patients with chronic urticaria that is not further defined or specified
[64,65,66,67,68,69]. These are classified as “CU studies” and can be presumed to be CIU/CSU
as the terms physical urticaria or CindU were not used to describe the sample.

The majority of studies (n=51; 60.7%) were categorized as “C/U/CSU or CU with
comorbidities/conditions” [18,19,20,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81 ,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,
89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,
114,115,116,117]. These included CIU/CSU or CU patients with relevant comorbidities including
inducible urticarias, asthma, allergic disorders (e.g., allergic rhinitis), auto-immune diseases (e.g.,
systemic lupus erythematosis), other rheumatoid diseases (e.g., psoriatic arthritis), or relevant
infectious diseases (e.g., hepatitis C virus). Other comorbidities such as diabetes Type II or
hypertension are not listed separately. A couple case studies on special circumstances or
conditions of particular interest (e.g., omalizumab use during pregnancy [86,87,97,112]) are also
included in this category.

There remained three studies (3.6%) with a mix of CIU/CSU patients as well as patients with
types of urticaria outside the scope of this review where censoring was not possible
[118,119,120]. We categorized these studies as “Mixed studies” and included this category in our

systematic review for the sake of completeness.
3.0 EVIDENCE BASE

Table 1 presents the 84 publications published through the search date of 28 September 2017 stratified
by the urticaria subtype of study. This Table details for each study the country or countries in which it was
conducted; the study design as specified in the publication; the censored cases and the resulting eligible
sample size; and the comorbidities of patients in the study. Also included are such demographics as the
mean(+SD) age of patients, the proportion of female subjects, and the mean(+SD) number of years since
subjects’ CIU/CSU diagnosis. It summarizes prior treatments received by patients in the study (with rates
if n22) as well as the mean(+SD) duration of omalizumab treatment (in months). The Table concludes
with the disease activity (UAS, UAS7, and/or UCT) and quality of life (DLQI or CU-Q,0L) outcomes
reported; whether the proportions of responders versus non-responders are reported; whether the
proportions by degree of response (complete, partial, none/refractory) are detailed; and whether safety
data are presented. Note that the two treatment response variables may have been assessed at either
one of two occasions, or both: as an initial response (as defined by each study) and as a final response to

treatment at end of study or observation period.

3.1 Study characteristics

Of the 84 studies, 25 (29.8%) were published before and 59 (70.2%) after the 2014 FDA and EMA

approval of omalizumab for the CIU/CSU indication. This review concerns a total of 1507 patients.

In total, 41.7% of studies reported disease activity outcomes: 11.9% used the UAS, 26.2% the UAS7, and
1.2% the UCT; two studies (2.4%) included both the UAS7 and UCT. Further, 13.1% of studies evaluated
quality of life outcomes, either with the DLQI (7.1% of studies) or the CU-Qzo0L (6.0% of studies).
Treatment response was reported in 76.2% of studies, including 16.7% of studies that classified patients
as responder versus non-responder, and 58.3% of studies that rated the degree of response (complete,
partial, non/refractory); one study (1.2%) included both. Safety data were reported in 61 (72.6%) of
studies and included 1327 patients.

Table 2 reveals that, on the aggregate, the majority of studies (n=75 or 89.3%) were focused narrowly on
CIU/CSU with or without angioedema, disease of auto-immune origin, and CIU/CSU or CU with relevant
comorbidities. About half of the publications (n=43 or 51.2%) described case studies or case series, about
a third (n=26 or 31.0%) were on retrospective studies, and the remainder (n=14 or 16.7%) reported on
prospective studies. In total, 68 (81.0%) studies had fewer than 30 patients, including 37 (44.0%) studies
with fewer than 5 subjects (Table S2). About half of studies (n=46 or 54.1%) were conducted in Europe,
followed by the Americas (n=22 or 25.9%; in particular North America with n=18 or 21.2%) (Table S2).

3.2 Patients

10
Considering that these are study-level data and may be limited by the data reported in any given
publication, most patients were women (70.6%) (Table 3). On average, patients were 43.7(+14.6) years
old; had been diagnosed with CIU/CSU 4.8(+5.1) years prior; and were treated with omalizumab for
8.4(+6.1) months. Virtually all patients had been previously treated with antihistamines (97.2%) and to a

lesser extent with corticosteroids (55.1%), cyclosporine (29.4%), and anti-leukotriene agents (18.2%).
3.3 Dosing

Omalizumab was initiated at 150 mg/dose in 34.5% of patients including 9.1% at a frequency of every two
weeks (Q2W) and 25.4% every four weeks (Q4W). More frequently, omalizumab was initiated at 300mg
(in 62.7% of patients) at a frequency of Q2W (4.2%) or Q4W (58.5%). Only 2.8% received a different
initial regimen in terms of dose (mg), frequency, or both. In the 23 publications reporting Q2W dosing at
initiation with either 150 or 300 mg, 74% were published in or prior to 2014. In mostreports, dose and/or
frequency was titrated to the lowest dose with the longest interval to control symptoms. The optimal or
end dose was 150mg Q2W in 1.6% of patients, 150mg Q4W in 35.8%, 300mg Q2W in 10.3%, 300mg
Q4W in 30.1%; while 22.2% were titrated to another dose/frequency (computed on 26 studies).

3.4 Outcomes

For the disease activity and quality of life outcomes, we calculated the study pre-treatment and end-ofstudy mean(+SD), the nominal change in mean value, and, as a standardized measure, the percent
change in mean (Table 4). Next, we calculated, for the aggregate sample and stratified by urticaria
subtype, the weighted pooled pre-treatment and end-of-study mean(+SD) for the disease activity and
quality of life outcomes, the nominal change in mean value, and, as a standardized measure, the percent
change in mean as well as the range of this percent change across the studies under consideration
(Table 5). Note that for scales where a lower score denotes a better outcome (UAS, UAS7, DLQI and CUQoL), the mean percent improvement cannot exceed 100%. Conversely, for the UCT, where a higher
score indicates a better outcome, this limit does not apply and mean percent improvement may exceed

100%. Also, end-of-study was per the definition in the study, which may have varied from study to study.

In 5 studies with 81 patients, 83.9% of patients were rated to be an initial responder (Table 5). In 14
studies with 186 patients, the initial response was rated as complete for 56.5% of patients and as partial
for an additional 26.9%, leaving 16.6% judged to have shown no response. As to final response, in 13
studies with 255 patients, 85% were rated to have shown a final response. In 50 studies with 921
patients, 67.9% were evaluated as having a complete response, 21.6% a partial response, and 10.5% to

had no response or being refractory.

In the overall weighted pooled analyses (Table 5), disease activity decreased by 82.4% (UAS; 10 studies
and 245 patients) and 86.9% (UAS7; 24 studies and 275 patients), while disease control increased by

11
113.5% (UCT; 3 studies and 39 patients). Quality of life outcomes improved by 76.2% (DLQI; 6 studies
and 70 patients) and 71.1% (CU-Q2oL; 5 studies and 72 patients).

Table 5 also presents the clinical outcomes and treatment responses rates for the different categories of
studies based on urticaria subtype. We compared the mean % change statistics, responder versus nonresponder rates, and degree of treatment response rates of each of these 5 urticaria subtypes to the
overall results. For the two categories with the most studies — the 21 C/U/CSU studies and the 51
CIU/CSU with comorbidities studies — all results were statistically similar to the overall results, which is
not surprising considering that, combined, these two categories accounted for 85.7% of studies. The
three CAU studies, the six CU studies, and the three Mixed studies showed some occasional deviations
from the corresponding results for all 84 studies, the 21 C/U/CSU studies, and the 51 C/U/CSU with
comorbidities studies. Where such differences were observed, these can be reasonably attributed to the

small number of studies involved.
3.5 Safety

Safety data, summarized in Table S4, were derived from 61 of the studies and involved 1,327 patients. A
total of 88 patients (6.6%) experienced an AE of which the majority were described as mild and transient.
Included in this overall AE count and rate is one study [101] that reported that an aggregated 9 patients
experienced one or more of 8 AEs without specifying counts/rates per AE. Another study [50] with 41
patients provided a non-numerical summary of 4 mild AEs without reporting counts; hence, these AEs are
not included in the overall count/rate. The most frequently reported events were headache (n=11), fatigue
(n=8), and injection site reaction (n=8). Three patients (0.2%) experience SAE, all anaphylaxis [54,92];
although in two patients [92] it is unclear if the SAE is treatment- or disease-related and omalizumab
treatment was continued in both cases. In total, nine patients (0.7%) discontinued treatment due to
AE/SAE. One of the reported AEs characterized as “an anaphylactoid reaction” [70] is not classified as a
SAE as omalizumab treatment for comorbid CIU and asthma was effective in managing both urticaria

flares and wheezing and was continued for six months despite AE symptoms before being discontinued.
3.6 Other,
3.6.1 Time to Response

Eighteen of the studies reported time to response (Table S5). Of note is the rapid response in some

patients reported in hours or days.
3.6.2 Medication Use

Several studies evaluated continued use and discontinuation of other CIU/CSU treatments following

initiation of omalizumab. These assessments included medication scoring systems [61,117,120],

medication counts (e.g., number of tablets or mg) for routine medications [65,76] or rescue medications
[21,63], and treatment scoring systems that combined symptom and medication scoring [73,93]. Variation
in assessment methods coupled with low counts of studies using each method precluded aggregation of
these assessments. More frequently, only the discontinuation rate of medications was reported.
Discontinuation of routine antihistamines following omalizumab treatment was achieved in 60.0% of 251
patients from 16 studies (data not shown). Of patients taking corticosteroids at the time of omalizumab
initiation, 75.3% were able to discontinue corticosteroid therapy after omalizumab treatment (n=263
patients from 15 studies); 72.3% discontinued anti-leukotriene therapy (n=166 from 7 studies); and 71.7%

discontinued immunomodulatory treatment (n=186 from 6 studies) (data not shown).

4.0 COMMENTS

Real-world evidence has become critical to better understand the effectiveness of medications, previously
shown to be efficacious in randomized clinical trials, under conditions of heterogeneity in patients,
treatment regimens, clinicians, and settings. Whereas many effectiveness studies focus on the question
of whether a medication works or does not work under such heterogeneity, it is just as essential to
answer the following questions, especially in the case omalizumab [26]: in which patients with CIU/CSU
does omalizumab work, and in which does it not? To what degree does omalizumab work in these
patients? In which CIU/CSU treatment patterns and combinations does omalizumab work well, and in
which less so or not? In which settings does omalizumab work well, less so, or not? Who responds to the
medication and treatment, and who responds poorly or not? And, in whom is omalizumab safe, and in

whom is it not? Our systematic review aimed to provide at least partial answers to these questions.

Typically, effectiveness studies are undertaken after a new agent has received regulatory approval. This
certainly applies to first indications, as was the case when omalizumab was approved for severe allergic
asthma. To date at least 25 prospective and retrospective effectiveness studies with evaluable samples
as large as 925 patients have been conducted to answer the above questions [26,121]. Where the
trajectory of a second indication, such as omalizumab for CIU/CSU, differs from the planned postapproval trajectory for the initial indication, is in its mix of exploratory and planned investigations. In the
setting of CIU/CSU, the trajectory has been one of initial case reports and case series prior to and
concurrent with registration trials, followed by small sample investigations and formal post-approval
studies. Half of the 84 studies included in this systematic review were case reports and case series, about
one-third were retrospective studies, but only 14 (16.7%) were prospective. Compare this to the 24
studies in the systematic review of omalizumab in severe allergic asthma, where 18 (75.0%) were

prospective and the remainder retrospective [26].

The exploratory trajectory of the use of omalizumab in CIU/CSU is also evidenced in the variability in the
dosing patterns observed across studies. The most common initiation dose (62.7%) was 300mg, whereas
34.5% of patients received 150mg, and the remaining 2.8% other regimens. The most common frequency
(83.9%) was every 4 weeks. This suggests that, certainly in the early evaluations of omalizumab in
CIU/CSU, the dosing for the severe allergic asthma indication was followed. However, this changed
markedly when, later in the treatment, doses were titrated. The proportion of patients dosed at 150mg
Q4W remained about the same (35.8%), the proportion of patients treated with 300mg Q4W declined
(30.1%), and almost a quarter of patients (22.2%) had other dose and frequency regimens. This
underscores the importance of individualizing dose and frequency. This individualization of treatment may
prove to be a significant marker of omalizumab therapy in CIU/CSU and should be investigated in future

effectiveness studies.

14
The outcomes of interest included in the studies in this systematic review further document the trajectory
from initial exploration of omalizumab in CIU/CSU to its later validation. Most studies reported on
treatment response (76.2%) and safety (72.6%), reflecting a consistent assessment of overall
effectiveness and safety across studies - and, by extension, time. A focus on disease activity was less
prevalent (41.7% of studies). The attention to quality of life, a prominent variable in allergy research and
practice, was assessed in only 13.1% of studies — when quality of life is intricately tied to patients’
symptom experience. This, too, is another area requiring further investigation so as to get a better view

on the patient-centric aspects of managing CIU/CSU in general and with omalizumab.

Related to one study on 32 patients included in this systematic review [109], a separate case report on 2
of those patients who were treated with concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors was
subsequently published [122]. These patients experienced an initial response to omalizumab followed by
loss of effectiveness; following discontinuation of ACE inhibitor treatment, urticarial symptoms were again
controlled with omalizumab. Whether concomitant therapies that interfere with biologic pathways that can
cause angioedema, such as ACE inhibitors, may result in a more resistant form of CIU/CSU and/or
decreased response to omalizumab is still unclear and requires further investigation. In general, ACE

inhibitors should be avoided or discontinued in patients with angioedema.

After the search for this systematic review was completed and while data were being aggregated, Wang
et al. [123] published a retrospective study on omalizumab in CIU using US claims data. Of the 88
patients for whom data were available for 12 or more months, 75.4% were initiated on 300mg, 18.8% on
150mg, and 5.8% on other doses — mainly (96.2%) Q4W. Most (69.6%) patients remained on their initial
dose, and about half (46.2%) on the initial frequency of administration. The treatment response rate was
83.7%. This recent study is consistent with the findings of this systematic review. Additional evidence of
real-world use of omalizumab is anticipated from forthcoming results from the AWARE study (A Worldwide Antihistamine-Refractory Chronic Urticaria Patient Evaluation), a multinational study designed to
assess pharmacological treatment and outcomes in nsAH-refractory CU patients in the real-life setting
[124,125].

5.0 EXPERT OPINION

The clinical outcomes observed across studies underscore the effectiveness of omalizumab as treatment
for CIU/CSU in the real-world setting. On the aggregate, across studies reporting specific outcomes, the
rate of initial treatment response was 83.9%, with over half (56.5%) of patients classified as showing a
complete response. The response rate at the end of the respective observation periods was similar
(85.0%), with two-thirds (67.9%) of patients showing a complete response. In addition to demonstrating
effectiveness, these rates also suggest that continued treatment may assist patients with an initial partial
response to achieve a complete treatment response — though this needs to be documented in future
studies. Further, these response rates are also aligned with the observed change in disease activity
scores and urticaria symptoms. Scores on the UAS and UAS7 decreased by 82.4% and 86.9%,
respectively, while scores on the (reversely scored) UCT improved by 113.5%. The high (clinician-rated)
treatment response rates and the marked changes in (patient-reported) disease activity are reflected in

the distinct improvements in (patient-reported) quality of life ratings.

The high and convincing effectiveness outcomes seen across the 84 publications were also observed
when studies were classified by urticaria subtype - suggesting that the disease itself, not its subtypes, are
positively impacted by treatment with omalizumab. Notably, omalizumab was found to be comparably
effective in patients with comorbid allergic and immunologic diseases as well as those with comorbid
CindU. Further, several case studies reported omalizumab treatment during pregnancy [86,97,112] and
one case study concerned a patient treated through two consecutive pregnancies [87] - all with
demonstrable effectiveness and no adverse effects to the mothers or newborns. Effectiveness and safety
data were likewise reported in patients with hepatitis B [110] and hepatitis C virus [89], human

immunodeficiency virus [113], and chronic lymphatic B-cell-leukemia undergoing chemotherapy [88].

To this should be added the time-to-response data reported by studies, which ranged from rapid-onset
complete response within hours or days following the first injection in some patients to, generally, patients
responding within weeks. For instance, in one study [49] 87.5% of patients responded within 4-8 weeks
while another study reported a mean time-to-response of 9.27 weeks [76]. Relatedly, evidence is
accumulating on the long-term effectiveness and safety of omalizumab use in CIU/CSU including
treatment durations of >1 year [56], up to 2 years [46], > 2 years [93,95,105], up to 3 years [115], 3 years
[87,102], 2-4 years [81], up to 5 years [69], 5 years [86], up to 6 years [48], and up to 9 years [67].

The positive therapeutic profile of omalizumab is also supported by the safety data. The AE rate of 6.6%
and SAE rate of 0.2% are in line with phase III safety results [23,24,25] and the product label [17]. With
regards to 2 (of the 3) cases of anaphylaxis, the investigators noted that it was unclear whether the
anaphylactic reactions were treatment- or disease-related and treatment with omalizumab was continued
in both cases. While the potential for anaphylaxis may cause dermatologists to be reluctant about

prescribing omalizumab, our review supports the general notion that anaphylaxis is a very rare event.

16
The findings on discontinuation of other medications following initiation of omalizumab therapy should be
interpreted with some caution as there was significant variation in methods across studies. Nonetheless,
the data are encouraging with over 70% of patients having treatment with corticosteroids, antileukotriene
agents, or immunomodulatory agents discontinued; and 60% of patients being discontinued from routine

antihistamine therapy. Medication use patterns should be evaluated more systematically in future studies.

Additionally, future real-world studies on omalizumab for CIU/CSU should focus on the following priorities.
Prospective studies are preferred because greater attention can be given to design and data model, thus
permitting investigations that are broader than what retrospective studies typically permit. The burden of
CIU/CSU merits further investigation. Also, to better align CIU/CSU studies with those on omalizumab in
severe allergic asthma, the impact of disease on social functioning, work or school performance, and
healthcare resource utilization should be elucidated further. The interaction between symptom
experience, symptom distress, treatment, and quality of life should also be examined. More generally,
modeling of variables associated with treatment outcomes should be integrated as much as possible into

future studies.

Despite the strong evidence on the real-world effectiveness and safety of omalizumab presented in our
systematic review, some caution is warranted. About half of the studies included in our review were case
studies and case series, which hold the inherent risk of emphasizing mainly positive experiences with
omalizumab, and not balancing this with possible negative results. In addition, the studies with larger
samples were based on convenience samples, not samples obtained by means of probabilistic methods.
Further, studies varied in terms of level of detail in reporting, outcome measures assessed, and duration
of treatment and follow-up. Lastly, it is possible that additional real-world evidence exists but was
overlooked; use of other database search engines such as Scopus or Google Scholar may have identified
such publications. Despite these limitations, the body of evidence as a whole presents compelling results
from which conclusions about the real-world effectiveness and safety of omalizumab in the CIU/CSU

indication can be drawn.

In conclusion, the real-world evidence aggregated in this systematic review points convincingly at the high
degree of effectiveness of omalizumab in the treatment of patients with CIU/CSU with or without
comorbidities or special conditions, CAU, or CU in daily clinical practice. The 84 publications included in
the review represent patient samples with considerable heterogeneity in terms of demographics,
comorbidities, disease history and omalizumab treatment patterns; yet the findings in terms of outcomes,

whether disease activity measures, response rates or quality of life, are highly consistent.

While observational data from case reports, case series, and retrospective and prospective observational
studies do not permit direct inferences of causality, the effectiveness and safety of omalizumab certainly
meets the Mosteller [126] criteria for causal interpretations from non-experimental data: 1) consistency, or

that the same effects are achieved regularly, and across people and time; 2) responsiveness, or that

17
variations in treatment precede variations in effects; 3) a mechanism that explains how the effect is
created; and 4) uniqueness, or the ability to dismiss alternative explanations of the effect other than the
treatment. Coupled with the fact that the safety findings are in line with those from phase Ill trials and as
described in the product label, omalizumab should be considered a highly effective and safe treatment for

CIU/CSU and related urticarial diseases.
ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS

e As there is no cure for chronic idiopathic/spontaneous urticaria (CIU/CSU), treatment is focused
on improving clinical outcomes — from disease control and symptom management to quality of
life. Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal anti-IgE antibody approved initially for
the treatment of severe allergic asthma, but since 2014 also for CIU/CSU in adults and
adolescents 12 years of age and older who remain symptomatic despite treatment with nonsedating anti-histamines.

e Asystematic review was conducted of 84 case reports, case series, and retrospective and
prospective observational studies showing a trajectory from early exploration of the use of
omalizumab in CIU/CSU to larger studies of treatment patterns and outcomes in daily clinical
practice.

e There is strong and sustained real-world evidence that a broad range of CIU/CSU patients

respond to treatment with omalizumab in terms of reductions in disease activity and improvement

in disease control; translating into significant improvements in quality of life.

e The most commonly prescribed initiation and titration dose is 300mg, though about one-third of

patients are started on 150mg. The most common frequency of administration is Q4W, though

titrated dosing regimens may vary.

 

e The safety profile insdaily clinical practice is in line with results of phase III trials and the product
label.

e Most real-world studies,reviewed here were case reports, case series, and retrospective
observational studies. There is a continued need for prospective real-world effectiveness and

safety studies.

* From 2005 to 2015, 17 patients with refractory CU were placed on a trial of omalizumab. Ten patients
(58.8%) responded and 7 (41.2%) did not. This report is on the 10 responders who were treatedi>=1
year.

t+ Omalizumab treatment duration missing for 1 patient (case #2); however, duration for.this patient was
reported in a separate case study [Sussman GL, Hebert J, Simons ER. A 63-year-old man with chronic
spontaneous urticaria. CMAJ. 2016;188(4):279-283.] and is included here.

+ Safety data are for the entire sample of n=154 patients as the safety data on the 17 censored CindU
patients could not be teased apart.

§ The sample of n=25 patients comprises a subset of patients who were previously treated and achieved
complete response, as reported in Metz et al. 2014 J Derm Sci, who then subsequently relapsed. Results
from 2014 JAMA Derm are unique and are related to re-treatment with omalizumab.

* From 2005 to 2015, 17 patients with refractory CU were placed on a trial of omalizumab. Ten patients
(58.8%) responded,and 7 (41.2%) did not. This report is on the 10 responders who were treated 21 year.
t Of 18 responders (complete or partial) who subsequently discontinued omalizumab after at least 6
months of treatment, 11 (61.1%) relapsed and 7 (38.9%) sustained remission. Of the 11 who relapsed,
10 were re-treated with omalizumab; all responded to re-treatment, 50% completely, 50% partially.
