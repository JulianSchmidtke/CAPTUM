ABSTRACT

Background: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is chronic wheals without identifiable exogenous stimuli. Autologous whole blood (AWB) injection and autologous serum therapy (AST) are alternative therapies for CSU that induce tolerance to circulating histamine-releasing factors.

Objective: We elucidated currently available evidence for the efficacy and safety of AWB therapy and
AST for CSU.

Methods: We systematically searched four databases for eligible studies to perform meta-analysis. The
primary outcome was the efficacy of AST or AWB therapy, and the secondary outcome was improvement
after intervention based on the autologous serum skin test (ASST) status of patients.

Results: Eight clinical trials, including four randomized controlled trials and 529 CSU patients, were identified. AST was not more effective than the placebo treatment in alleviating CSU symptoms at the end of
treatment (p =.161), and AWB injection was also not more effective in response rates than the placebo at
the end of follow-up (p =.099). Furthermore, the efficacy of AST or AWB injection for CSU and the ASST
status were not significantly related. No remarkable adverse events were recorded during therapy.
Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggested that AWB therapy and AST are not significantly more effective

in alleviating CSU symptoms than the placebo treatment.

Introduction

Chronic urticaria is defined as the presence of urticarial symptoms, such as wheals or angioedema, for most days during a
period exceeding 6weeks, and it can be further classified
as chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) or chronic inducible urticaria (CIU). In contrast to CIU, which has defined triggers, CSU is
independent of any exogenous stimuli (1). Chronic urticaria substantially lowers patients’ quality of life because of intense
pruritus, sleep disturbances, and concerns about physical appearance (2).

Release of histamine by mast cells and basophils is considered
the final event in the pathophysiology of all types of urticaria,
and autoimmunity is considered one of the most common initial
causes of CSU (3). Two mechanisms of the pathogenesis of autoreactivity in CSU have been identified. The first mechanism, a type
hypersensitivity reaction, represents autoallergy in which autoantigens crosslink immunoglobulin E (IgE) autoantibodies (AAbs) on
mast cells and basophils. The second mechanism is a type Il
hypersensitivity reaction in the presence of IgG AAbs against the
a subunit of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRla), low-affinity IgE
receptor (FceRIl), or IgE. Both autoimmunity-based mechanisms
inally induce the release of vasoactive mediators, including histamine, from mast cells and basophils (3,4). In addition, the autologous serum skin test (ASST) through intradermal injection of a
patient’s own serum is considered a screening test for autoimmune CSU (4).

 

Based on strong evidence, nonsedating second-generation
antihistamines are considered first-line treatment by most international guidelines (5). However, only approximately half of the
treated patients exhibit an adequate therapeutic response even
after receiving increased doses of an antihistamine drug or a combination of different antihistamine agents. Furthermore, these
interventions may cause considerable sedation and adversely
affect patients’ daily activities (6). For refractory patients, several
immunosuppressants or biological agents may be considered.
Furthermore, autochemotherapy, including autologous whole
blood (AWB) injection or autologous serum therapy (AST), is used
based on the pathophysiology of autoimmunity in CSU (7,8).
Generally, AWB therapy or AST is administered through regular
intramuscular injection of autologous venous blood for a fixed
period. Autochemotherapy can induce tolerization or desensitization to circulating proinflammatory signals in CSU patients (9).

Several studies have investigated the efficacy of AWB injection
or AST for CSU, but the results are inconsistent. We, therefore,
conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis
to elucidate the efficacy of AWB injection and AST.

group (10-12). Databases including PubMed, Embase, the
Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were systematically
searched for all eligible studies before September 30 2018. The
search strategy included the following keywords: ‘autologous
whole blood injection’ or ‘autologous serum therapy’ combined
with ‘chronic urticaria.’

Initially, H. C. Chang screened the titles and abstracts of articles
for topic correlation. Patient-based interventional studies were
included if (a) the study population comprised patients with CSU,
(b) the intervention was AST or AWB injection, (c) the comparator
was a placebo drug or comparison was based on the ASST status,
(d) definite measurements of disease outcomes as well as records
of treatment side effects were reported, and (e) protocols of nonrandomized or randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were described
in detail.

 

Data extraction, outcome measurement, and bias assessment

In this meta-analysis, two independent authors (H.C. Chang and
C.W. Sung) conducted a literature review and extracted data from
the eligible studies separately by using a standardized data
extraction protocol. The following data were extracted: first
author, year of publication, study design, duration of CSU, numbers of patients in the treatment (AST or AWB) and/or placebo
groups, ASST status (if available), manners of intervention, outcome measurements, and duration of follow-up. The primary outcome was the efficacy of AST or AWB therapy in CSU patients.
Currently, various scoring systems are used for the evaluation of
activity of urticaria, including urticaria total severity score (TSS),
urticaria activity score (UAS), urticaria activity score for 7 days
(UAS7), and revised UAS. The patients were evaluated at the end
of treatment and/or at the end of follow-up. The secondary outcome was an improvement after intervention based on the ASST
status of the patients. The quality of RCTs and non-RCTs was independently evaluated by two authors by using the risk of bias 2.0
(RoB 2.0) tool (13), and risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of
interventions (ROBINS-I) tool, respectively (14). Discrepancies in
the evaluations were resolved through objective discussion and
coordination with a senior dermatologist (M.H. Lin).

Statistical analysis

Pooled effects were calculated using a random-effects model
because of the heterogeneity of the included studies. Chisquared and /? tests were used to evaluate heterogeneity
across the studies (7 <25%, low heterogeneity; P=25-50%,
moderate heterogeneity; and /? >50%, high heterogeneity).
Potential publication bias was examined using Begg’s funnel
plot as well as Egger’s test (15). An asymmetric funnel plot and
p<.05 suggested possible publication bias. Statistical analyses
were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3.0
(Biostat, Englewood, NJ).

Results
Major characteristics of selected studies

In total, 403 studies from PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane
Library, and Web of Science were initially included for identification. The PRISMA flow chart for the selection process is
shown in Figure 1. Eventually, only eight studies were included
in our meta-analysis after we excluded four studies during

qualitative screening (ambiguous outcome definitions). The
eight studies included four RCTs (three single-blind trials and
one double-blind trial) and four non-RCTs. A total of 403
patients received AST or AWB intervention, while 126 patients
received the placebo. The dosage and therapy duration differed
among the included studies. For AST, the dosage in most studies was 2.0-2.5ml weekly for 9weeks; however, the dose was
doubled to 5ml in Kocatiirk’s study (16). For AWB therapy, the
dosage was 5ml weekly for 7 weeks in two studies (17,18) and
for 9weeks in one study (16), and the initial dose (in the first
week) was 2.5ml. Additionally, the longest duration of followup differed in these studies, ranging from 12 to 25 weeks.
Other detailed characteristics and demographic data of the
eight included studies, from 2006 to 2017, are presented in
Table 1 (16-23). The quality evaluation for the risk of bias of
each included study is presented in Figure 2; none of the
included studies had a high risk of bias.

Meta-analysis of the efficacy of AWB injection or AST for CSU

Figure 3(a) investigated the efficacy of AST at the end of the
treatment compared with that of the placebo treatment. The
pooled estimate did not reveal a significant difference in the
reduction of TSS between the AST and placebo groups [standardized mean difference (SMD), 1.083; 95% confidence interval (Cl),
—0.433 to 2.599; p=.161] at the end of treatment. However, at
the end of follow-up, as shown in Figure 3(b), a significant difference in the reduction of TSS (from baseline) was observed
between the AST and placebo groups (SMD: 0.545; 95% Cl:
0.022-1.067; p=.041). Furthermore, considering the effect of the
ASST status, the reduction in TSS after AST was analyzed between
the ASST (+) and ASST (—) groups at the end of treatment or follow-up, as shown in Figure 4(a,b), respectively. The reduction in
TSS (compared with the baseline) did not differ significantly
between the ASST (+) and ASST (—) groups at the end of treatment (SMD: 4.956; 95% Cl: —5.053 to 14.966; p=.332) or at the
end of follow-up (SMD: 0.312; 95% Cl: —0.601 to 1.224; p=.503).
Figure 4(c) presents the outcome of urticaria evaluated on the
basis of UAS7 after the final dose of AST or AWB injection, and
the patients stratified according to their ASST status. Consistent
with the result of TSS, we found that the SMDs in UAS7 were
similar for the ASST (+) and ASST (—) groups (SMD, —0.446; 95%
Cl: —0.960 to 0.069; p=.09).

Figure 5(a) presents a comparison of responses in terms of
revised UAS between the AWB injection and placebo groups. A
response was defined as an improvement of >30% in clinical
scores according to the definition provided in the originally
included studies. The forest plot did not reveal significant
improvement in urticaria after AWB injection [odds ratio (OR),
2.033; 95% Cl: 0.876-4.717; p=.099] at the end of follow-up. At
the end of follow-up after AWB therapy, the pooled estimate
did not show a significant difference in the responses between
the ASST (+) or ASST (—) groups (OR: 2.234; 95% Cl:
0.623-8.015; p=.217) (Figure 5(b)). Not sufficient data for metaanalysis at the end of the final dose of AWB therapy
were available.

Safety and adverse events

None of the patients suffered any serious adverse effects after
AWB therapy or AST in our included studies. Only some transient
local side effects, such as injection pain or soreness, minimal local
bleeding, and bruising, were rarely reported (17-19,22,23).

Therefore, AWB injection and AST are relatively safe treatment for
CSU patients.

Assessment for heterogeneity and risk of publication bias

Heterogeneity across studies was relatively low only in the metaanalysis for the efficacy of AWB therapy compared with the placebo and in the subanalysis between ASST (++) and ASST (—) CSU
patients (Figure 5). No analysis for publication bias was performed
because less than three studies were included in each meta-analysis in the current study.

Discussion

CSU is a common and debilitating disease that has severe negative effects on patients’ quality of life and socioeconomic status.

 

CSU patients resistant to first-line antihistamine therapy should
use therapy with a high risk of side effects, such as cyclosporine,
methotrexate, and steroids or high-cost medications such as omalizumab (24). Beyond this alternative therapy, AWB injection or
AST has been proposed as a strategy to induce tolerance to autoimmunity in CSU.

This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the efficacy and safety of AWB injection and AST for CSU. AST was not
more effective than the placebo for CSU after weekly treatment
for 9weeks, but a borderline significant reduction in TSS in the
AST group was noted at the end of follow-up. Future studies with
different treatment duration and prolonged follow-up are warranted to elucidate this discrepancy. AWB therapy was also not
significantly superior to the placebo treatment in response rates
at the end of follow-up after 4-6weeks of the final treatment.
Furthermore, no significant difference in the efficacy of AST or

AWB therapy for CSU was observed between the ASST (+) and
ASST (—) patients. No remarkable adverse events were recorded
during and after therapy.

The ASST is the generally available test for the screening of
AAbs against IgE or FceRI, and approximately one-third to onehalf of CSU patients exhibit a positive response to the ASST
(25,26). However, the clinical relevance of these AAbs remains
unclear, and the relationship between treatment efficacy and
ASST response in CSU patients remain controversial (26,27). Our
current results also did not show a significant difference in the
clinical scores reduction or percentage of responders after AST or
AWB therapy, respectively, between the ASST (+) and ASST (—)
groups. However, some studies that were not included in final
meta-analysis but they were in our initial qualitative synthesis
indicated controversies regarding the ASST. Tseng et al. reported
that ~88% of ASST (+) CSU patients and 25% of ASST (—) CSU
patients showed significant improvement in the revised UAS after
AWB therapy (28). Possible selection biases should be considered
for this retrospective study. Nevertheless, in another study by You
et al, a higher response rate (>30% improvement on average) or

improvement in the UAS7 was observed in ASST (—) patients than
in ASST (+) patients (40% vs. 28.5%) after AWB therapy; however,
the difference was not significant (29). Further well-designed RCTs
are required to elucidate the current results regarding the relationship between the ASST status and efficacy of autochemotherapy in CSU patients.

Compared with a previous systematic review of a similar topic
by Brewer (30), in this study, we not only included relatively
recent studies but also analyzed the data from different viewpoints for meta-analysis. First, we enrolled four additional studies
including one RCT published after 2014. Second, we categorized
the results of most of our meta-analysis based on the original
clinical scoring system instead of using a combination of response
rates of different scores. Our method provided more specific information on the difference in the mean difference for all the participants and not only the responders. Moreover, because each
scoring system consisted of different items and evaluations, individual analysis according to the original assessment may provide
detailed information for clinical practitioners. Furthermore, we
analyzed the efficacy of AST at the end treatment in addition to

Figure 5. Meta-analysis of responses in terms of improvement (>30%) in the revised UAS after AWB injection (a) between the treatment and placebo groups or (b)

between the ASST (+) and ASST (—) groups at the end of follow-up.

at the end of follow-up of each study, and this is highly compatible with the real-world clinical situation for immediate effects
after one entire course of therapy. Consistent with conclusions
made by Brewer, our study demonstrated that autochemotherapy
including AST and AWB therapy was not statistically more effective in reducing symptoms than the placebo treatment at the end
of follow-up.

This systematic review and meta-analysis had some limitations.
First, only two studies were included in each meta-analysis
because of high divergence in the clinical scoring systems and
evaluations of outcomes for urticaria in each study; moreover, the
tisk of publication bias could not be assessed. Second, no metaanalysis was conducted for direct comparison of the efficacy
between AWB therapy and AST for CSU, because sufficient assessable data were not available. Finally, high heterogeneity across
studies existed in most of the current analysis.

In conclusion, our meta-analysis suggested that AWB therapy
and AST are not more effective in alleviating CSU symptoms than
the placebo treatment, but these therapies were relatively safe
and did not show remarkable adverse effects. The efficacy of AWB
therapy and AST for CSU was also not significantly different
between the ASST (+) and ASST (—) groups. Considering the low
number of high-quality studies included in the meta-analysis and
the high heterogeneity across these studies, additional welldesigned RCTs are essential to obtain more evidence to confirm
our current conclusions.
