What is already known about this topic? Cholinergic urticaria (UCOL) is an inducible urticaria triggered by active or
passive increase in core body temperature. It is highly disabling. There is no available treatment for this condition. Antihistamines that usually control other types of urticaria can only partially alleviate UCOL.

What does this article add to your knowledge? This is the first clinical trial with omalizumab for UCOL. We observed a

significant improvement in our main outcome, which is a negative exercise challenge test result from week 16, with
significant improvements in the UCOL score, daily symptoms, and quality of life. A slow and progressive response to the
treatment was observed.

How does this study impact current management guidelines? Omalizumab shows evidence of the safety and po
tential efficacy in patients with UCOL.

BACKGROUND: Cholinergic urticaria (UCOL) is a highly
disabling inducible urticaria triggered by an increase in core
body temperature.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the safety and efficacy of omalizumab
in controlling UCOL.

METHODS: We conducted a multicenter randomized mixed
double-blind and open-label (first 4 months blinded followed by
8 months open-label) placebo-controlled clinical trial in 22 patients suffering from UCOL who were unresponsive to a double

INTRODUCTION

Cholinergic urticaria (UCOL) consists of the appearance of
itching, pin-point wheals induced by an active (eg, exercise) or
passive (eg, hot bath) increase in core body temperature, which
fade away when the body cools.! It is highly disabling,” with a
substantial impact on patients’ daily activities and work performance. Each patient has his or her own stimulus threshold, and
symptoms can be triggered by minimal activity such as climbing
stairs or entering a heated building from the cooler outside
temperature.

UCOL starts at a young age. In contrast to patients with other
inducible urticarias, who have periods of remission or diminished
intensity, most patients with UCOL suffer the condition their
entire lives.* Consequently, they become accustomed to the
disease, avoiding activities that induce urticaria and changing
their daily habits without seeking medical treatment.

The etiology and pathogenesis of hive formation remains
unknown, although it has been recognized that mast cells and
basophils are clearly involved.* It has been hypothesized that
cellular activation could occur through the interaction between
acetylcholine and mast cells or basophils and may be due to a
hypersensitivity to sweat antigens.”* However, UCOL has also
been observed in patients with anhidrosis and/or hypohidrosis.’
As in other inducible urticarias, specific IgE antibodies against
serum proteins have been found in passive transfer experiments
on UCOL.'” The prevalence of UCOL was 11.2% in a study of
499 German high school and university students'' and 4.2% in a

J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT
MONTH 2019

study in a young Indian population. '* In both cases, the
condition was mostly mild.

Despite the high morbidity of UCOL and its impact on
patient quality of life, there is no available treatment for this
condition. Antihistamines that usually control other types of
urticaria can only partially alleviate UCOL. There have only been
4 controlled studies, which have been reviewed elsewhere, '* and
1 of them showed the partial efficacy of doubling the Tecom:
mended dose of the second-generation antihistamine cetirizine.

In small isolated case reports, omalizumab has been shown to
be effective at controlling UCOL in patients who are unresponsive to conventional therapies at maximum or offlabel
doses.'>'* In a recent retrospective study comprising 16
patients suffering from UCOL, 7 combined with other types of
urticaria including chronic spontaneous urticaria and 9 with
isolated UCOL, a positive response was observed in 3 of them
and a major response in other 3 patients.'” A negative response
was also reported.”° Our rationale for the utilization of omalizumab in this type of urticaria is that it exerts an inhibitory
action on mast cell and basophil activation,!7" as has been
demonstrated in other inducible urticarias”’ such as dermographism” and cold urticaria.?’ We hypothesize that omalizumab is
able to revert the basophil or mast cell activation present in
urticaria,”

We conducted a multicenter randomized mixed double-blind
and open-label placebo-controlled clinical trial with the aim of
evaluating the efficacy and safety of omalizumab (Xolair) in
patients suffering from UCOL who are unresponsive to a double
dose of antihistamines.

METHODS
Study population

A multicenter randomized mixed double-blind and open-label
placebo-controlled parallel clinical trial =~ was __ performed
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02012387; Eudra CT#2013002770-43). It was conducted at 7 sites distributed across Spain.
Each patient signed a written consent form.

The eligibility criteria included female and male patients aged 14
years or older with a diagnosis of UCOL according to clinical history
and a positive exercise challenge test result who were unresponsive to
supratherapeutic doses of antihistamines (defined as 2 x [maximal
dose included in the drug labeling]) and who provided written
informed consent. The exclusion criteria were the presence of pruritus related to dermatitis or other skin conditions; the presence of

 

any systemic disease that hampered follow-up or the interpretation
of data; the administration of omalizumab treatment within the
previous 12 months; the presence of any exclusion criteria included
on the drug label; and the presence of any other conditions that did
not allow the accomplishment of the clinical trial requisites, such as
the use of illicit drugs or alcohol abuse.

Patients with a clinical diagnosis of UCOL according to their
clinical history and positive exercise challenge test results were
double the licensed dose of cetirizine (20 mg) for 2
weeks, and then the exercise challenge test was repeated. If the test
result was positive, patients were randomized to either the placebo

 

treated witl

group or the active treatment group for 16 weeks, receiving a

monthly dose during the blinded period. Starting in week 16, all

 

 

patients received omalizumab and performed an exercise challenge
test during each visit. This design allowed to achieve a 2-fold
objective: maximizing the sample size of a unique group receiving

omalizumab in order to evaluate the global negative rate, while
keeping the possibility of comparing blinded and parallel groups of
omalizumab and placebo. Three months after the last dose, the
patients returned for another follow-up visit during which they
performed a final exercise challenge test. We include a schematic of

the study design in Figure 1.

Treatment administration

The active intervention group received omalizumab (300-mg
dose, subcutaneous route, independent of total IgE levels, weight,
or height). Two injections of 150 mg were administered every 4
weeks for 4 months (4 doses within 16 weeks). The placebo

consisted of a saline serum (subcutaneous route, 0.6 mL saline serum

 

with the same volume as the active treatment). Two injections were
administered every 4 weeks for 4 months (4 doses within 16 weeks).
After the double-blind period, all patients from both arms received
the active intervention for 8 months (open-label period). Two injections of 150 mg were administered every 4 weeks for 8 months

(8 doses within 32 weeks).

Exercise challenge test

We performed the exercise challenge test following the European
guidelines”’ for UCOL. All centers followed the same standardized
protocol. The patients exercised by running on a treadmill until they
started sweating and then continued running for an additional 15

minutes. We registered the time intervals between the start of the
test and the first appearance of sweat and the first appearance of skin
lesions and the extent and duration of symptoms.

The test result was considered positive if the exercise challenge led
to the typical rash within 10 minutes from starting sweating.

Daily symptoms score

We created a daily symptom score (UCOL score) that combines the
stimuli that elicit the reaction, from passive warming up to intense
exercise, with the extent of the skin lesions, from isolated trunk hives
to generalized hives, with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score
of 6 (Table I). We wanted a simple, easy, and feasible scoring tool. We
adapted the measure tool from the Urticaria Activity Score because is
already validated and has a high patient adherence.

Basophil activation test with sera from patients with
UCOL

The basophi test was performed as previously
described.”’ Blood from healt! y donors was centrifuged, and cells

activation
above the red-blood cell layer were collected and resuspended in
stimulation buffer containing IL-3. Thereafter, the cells were stimulated with 50 [LL of sera from UCOL patient. After 30 minutes at
37°C, the stimulation was stopped, and the serum was eliminated by
washing the samples with cold washing buffer (PBS, 2 mM EDTA).
Samples were labeled with anti-IgE fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC) and anti-CD63 phycoerythrin (PE) for 30 minutes at 4°C.
The erythrocytes were lysed for 10 minutes at room temperature,
and the samples were washed twice before analyzing them in a
FACSCanto II flow cytometer (FACScan, Becton Dickinson, NJ).
Data were analyzed with FlowJo Tree Star software (Ashland, Ore).
In all cases, dead cells were eliminated on the basis of their forward
and side scattering profiles.

chronic urticaria quality of life (CU2-QoL) questionnaire”®; the
UCOL score; and the visual analog scale (VAS) score. Patient
symptom diaries with all incidences, use of rescue medication, and
adverse events were also collected. Each patient completed the CU2QoL questionnaire at each visit. Additional measures collected were
the number of study dropouts in each treatment group, the number
of sick leave days used because of UCOL, and the number of
emergency department visits. The use of rescue medication was also
recorded. Safety was assessed by means of the evaluation of adverse
events throughout the study.

Assuming an expected negative challenge rate of 11%,** 21
patients would have been necessary to provide a 70% power to
detect a difference, with an expected 30% response rate, with a
2-sided P value of .05 indicating statistical significance.

Participants were randomly assigned following simple randomization procedures (computerized random numbers) with a 1:1
allocation to receive either the placebo or active intervention during
the blinded portion of the study. The allocation sequence was
concealed until the intervention was assigned by central randomization. The patients and physicians were blinded to the allocation.
After the double-blind period, all patients from both arms received
the active drug for 8 more months (open-label period).

Statistical methods

All analyses were carried out on the basis of the intention-to-treat
principle. We calculated the means (and SDs) or median (percentile
25 [pas]; percentile 75 [p7s]) and frequencies of the baseline demographic and clinical characteristics for the whole study population

and separately by study arm. Differences in quantitative outcomes
between intervention groups were tested using independent sample t
tests. The Mann-Whitney test was used if the normal distribution of
the outcome could not be assumed. Changes in the means of
quantitative outcomes from the baseline to follow-up visits were
tested using paired sample ¢ tests. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs
signed-ranks test was used when the normality assumption was
violated. Normality was checked using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Dif
ferences in the distributions of categorical variables were tested using
the chi-square test or Fisher exact test. A binomial probability test
was used to compare the negative challenge after the last active
intervention visit with the expected negative challenge rate. Statistical significance was defined using a 2-sided @& level of 0.05. All
analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20 (IBM
Corp, Released 2011, IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version
20.0. Armonk, NY) and Stata version 14 (StataCorp LP, 2015, Stata
Statistical Software: Release 14, College Station, Texas).

RESULTS

All patients presented hives after exercise and/or passive
warming at the beginning of the study. None of the patients
suffered from exercise-induced anaphylaxis or respiratory,
gastrointestinal, or cardiovascular symptoms while presenting
hives. Twelve patients suffered urticaria induced by minimal

activity (climbing stairs, briskly walking), and 6 suffered urticaria
induced by spicy foods and stress.

In total, 29 patients were recruited. After receiving 20 mg of
cetirizine at the prescreening visit, 6 patients tested negative on
the exercise challenge test and were excluded, and 23 patients
tested positive and were randomized. One patient dropped out
after randomization before receiving the first study dose. Finally,
22 randomized patients received the intervention. The mean age
of the patients was 34.1 + 15 years; 16 were men, and 6 were
women (Table II).

The clinical and demographic features of the patients in the 2
intervention groups were fairly well balanced at randomization,
although those allocated to the placebo group appeared to have
faster time to disappearance of hives at baseline than did the
treatment group (Table I!).

During the blinded period of the study, 9 patients received
placebo and 13 patients received omalizumab. During the openlabel period of the study, all patients received omalizumab
starting at week 16 and ending at week 44. Figure 2 shows a
flowchart of the study.

FIGURE 3. Negative challenge of the exercise challenge test in the whole sample over time. A progressive increase in negative challenge
rates over time was observed. The overall negative challenge rate at week 48 was 31.3%, which differed significantly from a theoretical
response of 11% (P =.02). In the first 16 weeks of placebo-active comparison, the negative challenge rate in the placebo group was 2 of
9 (22.2%) and in the active group was 1 of 13 (7.7%) (P=.544). Data represent results for all placebo and active patients combined (n =
22). Week 4 (n = 19), week 6 (n = 22), week 12 (n = 21), week 16 (n = 22), week 20 (n = 21), week 24 (n = 20), week 28 (n = 20),
week 32 (n = 19), week 36 (n = 19), week 40 (n = 18), week 44 (n = 16), and week 48 (n = 16).

48 was 31.3%, which differed significantly from a theoretical
response of 11% (P = .02). We observed an average negative
challenge increase of 2.9 percentage points (95% CI, 1.5-4.2) per
visit. The highest negative challenge rates were observed at week
20 (38.1%) and at week 44 (37.5%) (Figure 3). Two of the 9
patients in the placebo group experienced negative challenge at
the end of the blinded period, whereas negative challenge was
observed in 1 of 13 patients in the treatment group (P = .544).

The UCOL score

During the blinded period, both intervention groups showed a
decrease in the UCOL score. The median UCOL score decrease
in the placebo group (n = 9) was —16 (p25: —353 p75: —11), and
the median decrease in the treatment group (n = 13) was —28
(pos: —41; p75: —14), although this difference was not statistically significant (P = .8247).
When comparing UCOL scores of the whole sample of
patients (n = 22) before treatment (median, 66; p25: 51; p7s:
108) and after receiving 4 (median, 40; p25: 20; p75: 82) or 8
doses of omalizumab (median, 40.5; pos: 7; p7s: 65), we
observed a statistically significant improvement (P = .0015 and
P = .0005, respectively). After stopping treatment with omalizumab, there was a statistically significant increase in the UCOL
score at the follow-up visit (week 60: median, 62; p25: 10; p7s:
12) compared with the last visit that evaluated the effect of the
last dose of omalizumab at week 48 (median, 20.5; p25: 6.5; ps:
56.5; P = .0156) (Figure 4).

 

Quality of life (CU2-QoL questionnaire)

During the blinded period, both intervention groups showed a
decrease in CU2-QoL questionnaire scores (which indicates an
improvement in the quality of life for both groups). This
decrease (improvement) was greater in the treatment group
(median, —7.6; p25: —19.6; p75: 10.9) than in the placebo group
(median, —6.5; p25: —9.8; p75: —3.3), although the difference
was not statistically significant (P = .7176).

When comparing the CU2-QoL questionnaire scores of the
whole sample of patients before treatment (median, 16.9; pos:
9.2; ps: 29.9) and after receiving 8 doses of omalizumab
(median, 7.6; p2s: 1.6; p75: 20.1), we observed a statistically
significant improvement (P = .0105). Likewise, after stopping
treatment with omalizumab, there was a statistically significant
increase (worsening) in the CU2-QoL questionnaire score at the
next follow-up visit (week 60: median, 13.6; p2s: 7.6; p75: 30.4)
compared with the score at the visit that evaluated the effect of
the last dose of omalizumab at week 48 (median, 4.4; pos: 1.1;
P7s: 16.3; P = .0002) (Figure 5).

The VAS score

During the blinded period, decreases in the VAS score of the
treatment group (median, —10; p25: —50; p7s: 0) and the placebo group (median, —10; p25: —40; p75: —5) were similar
(P = .9555).

After stopping the intervention, a rise in the UCOL score at follow-up visit (week 60) was observed. Data represent results for all placebo

and active patients combined (n = 22).

omalizumab (median, 25; p25: 5; p7s: 64), we observed a statistically significant improvement (P = .0108 and P = .0008,
respectively). After completing treatment with omalizumab,
there were statistically significant increases in VAS scores at the
follow-up visit (week 60: median, 65; p25: 27.5; p7s: 80)
compared with the visit that evaluated the effect of the last dose
of omalizumab at week 48 (median, 15; pos: 5; p7s: 535
P= .0002) (Figure 6).

Patient symptom diaries: Number of days with

symptoms

During the blinded period, both groups showed similar decreases in the number of days with symptoms (median for
placebo, —4, p25: —9, p75: —2; median for treatment, —3,
P25: —8, p75: 0; P = .4117).

‘When comparing the number of days with symptoms before
treatment (median, 18; pos: 11; p75: 23) and after receiving 4
(median, 10; p25: 5; p7s: 21) or 8 doses of omalizumab (median,
9; pos: 2; pzs: 20), we observed a statistically significant
improvement (P = .0125 and P = .0144, respectively). After
stopping treatment with omalizumab, there was a statistically
significant increase in days with symptoms at the follow-up visit
(week 60: median, 12; pos: 5; p75: 28) compared with the visit
that evaluated the effect of the last dose of omalizumab at week
48 (median, 5.5; p25: 2; pys: 16; P = .0333) (Figure 7).

Only 2 sick leave days were taken by the entire study population. Likewise, no patient required emergency visits during the

study due to UCOL.

Basophil activation test

Greater than 15% CD63 expression was considered positive.
None of the patients’ serum samples activated normal basophils.
The activation value obtained was 0.75% (Qos: 0.4; Qzs: 2.78)
CD63 activation.

Time to the appearance and disappearance of skin
lesions

During the blinded period, both intervention groups showed
increases in the time elapsed between the start of exercise and the
appearance of skin lesions and decreases in the time to the
disappearance of the skin lesions; however, we did not observe a
significant difference when comparing these times before treatment and after receiving 4 or 8 doses of omalizumab.

Rescue medication

Fourteen patients (63.3%) required rescue medication with
antihistamines and/or corticosteroids. The median (minimum,
maximum) number of patients receiving antihistamine prescriptions in the placebo and treatment groups was 1 (0, 15) and
1 (0, 5), respectively. The number of patients receiving 3 or more
prescriptions of antihistamines was 4 (44.4%) in the placebo
group and 2 (15.4%) in the treatment group, although this
apparent difference was not large enough to demonstrate a statistically significant association between a group during the
blinded period and the need for rescue medication (P = .178).
Two patients received corticosteroids (1 patient in the placebo
group received 2 prescriptions, and 1 patient in the treatment
group received 3 prescriptions).

months of the last omalizumab dose). The line inside the box represents the median value. The upper and lower ends of the box represent
the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively. Circles represent values outside the box-whisker. A progressive decrease (improvement) in
the CU2-QoL questionnaire score over time was observed. After stopping the intervention, a rise (worsening) in the CU2-QoL questionnaire score at follow-up visit (week 60) was observed. Data represent results for all placebo and active patients combined (n = 22).

Safety

There were 13 adverse events (AEs), 4 in the placebo group and
9 in the treatment arm. Eleven AEs were not related to the study,
and 2 were unlikely to be related. Eight AEs were classified as mild,
4 were moderate, and 1 was classified as severe because the patient
required hospitalization due to a scheduled surgery. None of the
AEs caused withdrawal from the study, and all of them were
resolved. In Table E.1 in this article’s Online Repository at www.
jaci-inpractice.org, we include the AEs in the list of events.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we observed an overall negative challenge rate of
the exercise challenge test of 31.3% in patients with UCOL who
did not respond to a double dose of antihistamines after receiving
omalizumab treatment for 8 months (placebo group) or 12
months (active intervention group). This negative challenge rate
was significantly higher than the expected rate of 11%.*' We did
not find statistically significant differences between the placebo
and active intervention groups at the end of the blinded period
(first 4 months of the study). However, we observed a significant
progressive improvement along time starting from the fourth
dose. We also noted improvements in the daily symptoms and
quality-of-life scores after active intervention compared with the
baseline values. Omalizumab treatment was well tolerated and
presented a good safety profile.

In contrast to what was observed in the chronic spontaneous
urticaria clinical trials,~” where a number of patients showed a
very fast response, in our study, the response was slower and
progressive. This is also in contrast with the very recent publication!’ on omalizumab in real life in patients with UCOL,

 

where a 6-week response is reported. However, it is difficult to
compare with our results because the study is a retrospective
nonplacebo comparison analysis of 16 patients from which 7 had
other concomitants types of urticaria including chronic spontaneous urticaria, patients received different doses, and it is not
clear whether an exercise challenge test was performed at each
visit. This fact may support in theory the role of IgE in the
pathogenesis of the disease,’”"* with similar timing of
omalizumab-induced reductions in allergen skin mast cell
response, °° mast cell skin receptors, or basophil function.”!
Consequently, the mechanism of action of omalizumab in
UCOL could be the sequestering of specific IgE against serum or
sweat proteins rather than direct action on the cells. In the
future, measuring specific IgE against known antigens could
serve as a good predictive marker of the response to omalizumab.
It would also be very interesting to profile omalizumab response
according to different subtypes of UCOL.” Thus, we want to
highlight the importance of maintaining omalizumab treatment
for more than 4 months to start assessing improvement.

As was the case in chronic spontaneous urticaria, we observed
a reappearance of symptoms in the 12-week posttreatment
follow-up visit.

Statistically significant differences between the placebo and
treatment groups in main outcomes were not demonstrated
during the blinded period (4 months). Exploring the impact of a
longer blinded period and a larger sample size may be warranted.
The fact that the placebo group had a significantly faster time to
hive disappearance at baseline could also be relevant to such
pattern of response. We should also take into account that as is
the case in all urticarias, there are spontaneous remissions.

FIGURE 6. The VAS score by weeks in the entire study population. B, Basal visit; FU, Follow-up visit (week 60, after 3 months of the last
omalizumab dose). The line inside the box represents the median value. The upper and lower ends of the box represent the 75th and 25th
percentiles, respectively. Circles represent values outside the box-whisker. A progressive decrease in the VAS score over time was
observed. After stopping the intervention, a rise in the VAS score at follow-up visit (week 60) was observed. Data represent results for all

placebo and active patients combined (n = 22).

There is a need of a treatment option for those patients who
are unresponsive to antihistamines. The need is even more urgent for patients with UCOL for whom no treatment apart from
antihistamines exists. To date, there have been no randomized
controlled clinical trials on omalizumab for UCOL. Moreover,
the data published are all based on case reviews, without assessing
the response to treatment by exercise challenge test, except in 1
case, or by symptom score. The data previously published are
mainly based on subjective self-reported symptoms. The first case
report of a complete response in 1 patient'’ observed a complete
response starting in week 5, with a negative challenge of the
exercise challenge test. Furthermore, a significant response in a
patient was also reported on the basis of quality-of-life questionnaire and self-reported exercise tolerance®’; both of the
aforementioned patients received 300 mg of omalizumab
monthly. Other publication reported a lack of response to
omalizumab”° in a patient receiving 300 mg every 2 weeks.
However, that patient had an IgE level of 1523 kU/mL and
might have needed a higher dose of omalizumab. The next isolated case!” also reported a significant symptom response to 300
mg of omalizumab administered every 7 weeks, with a significant
response starting in the ninth week of treatment and a complete
response at week 21, which agree with our observation of a slow
response pattern. Our response rate was 31.3%, which was
similar to that reported by Metz et al ina retrospective analysis,
wherein they describe a complete response in 5 of 8 patients and
a significant response in 1 patient. However, no description of
the outcome measures was provided, and the patients received
different doses of omalizumab; 4 patients started with 150 mg, 2
had their doses increased to 300 mg, 1 received 450 mg, and 1

 

patient received 300 mg monthly from the beginning. A retrospective case review’ reported a response in 3 of 4 patients
reviewed, with few data available on the response assessment.
The latest study published to date'’ raises a very interesting
point, which is that they obtained a positive response in those
nonrespondent patients by raising doses. Studies with higher
doses in nonresponders should be performed.

Another important contribution of our study is the clinical
tool, the UCOL score, that we designed. It is not always feasible
or practical to perform an exercise challenge test in the daily
routine clinical setting; however, severity and response to
treatment should be objectively measured. There is a reliable
and validated clinical tool, the Urticaria Activity Score summed
over 7 days,*° to measure spontaneous chronic urticaria
symptom severity; however, it is not applicable to UCOL
because Urticaria Activity Score summed over 7 days registers
the number of hives and itch severity over the last 24 hours and
over 7 days. Moreover, our tool not only measures skin
symptoms but also reflects the impact of the disease on daily
activities and serves to monitor treatment response in real life.
Our tool seems to be a sensitive instrument for monitoring
UCOL and the patient response to treatment. However, it is
yet to be validated against the exercise test, and subsequently
with a larger sample size. It should be validated as a tool to
measure antihistamine response. Once validated, it would also
be interesting to establish the threshold for deciding when a
patient could be classified as unresponsive to any given treatment. This is especially important when an expensive treatment
is an option, and the physician has to decide when a patient is
unresponsive to antihistamines.

FIGURE 7. Days with symptoms by weeks in the entire study population. B, Basal visit; FU, Follow-up visit (week 60, after 3 months of
the last omalizumab dose). The line inside the box represents the median value. The upper and lower ends of the box represent the 75th
and 25th percentiles, respectively. Circles represent values outside the box-whisker. A progressive decrease in days with symptoms over
time was observed. After stopping the intervention, a rise in the days with symptoms at follow-up visit (week 60) was observed. Data
represent results for all placebo and active patients combined (n = 22).

We used a 300-mg omalizumab dose because this dose
showed better outcomes in all types of urticaria in previous
studies.””°”°* Future dose-response studies with UCOL should
be performed. Moreover, as was the case for chronic spontaneous
urticaria, real-life studies would provide better insights.

UCOL, as is the case for other inducible urticarias, is
responsive to high doses of antihistamines. In our study, 6 of 29
initially included patients achieved control of the symptoms with
double doses of cetirizine. In the only study published '* on this
topic, with 11 patients, 20 mg of cetirizine was able to partially
control UCOL symptoms. As is the case for chronic spontaneous
urticaria, omalizumab may be useful as a second-line therapy for
those patients whose symptoms are not controlled with high
doses of antihistamines.

In spite of the moderate to severe intensity of their symptoms, the
patients suffering from UCOL did not take sick leave days or attend
emergency departments, suggesting that they are accustomed to
their condition and have adapted their daily life to its limitations.
Likewise, there is a lack of awareness of this type of inducible urticaria; consequently, this inducible urticaria might be overlooked.

As expected, none of the patients’ serum samples were able to
activate normal basophils; in chronic spontaneous urticaria, this
autoimmune property is found in 40% of patients’; this finding
reinforces the concept that different pathophysiological pathways
underlie various types of inducible urticarias.

Sweat allergy has been postulated as a pathomechanism factor
for UCOL.”” This fact was challenged because of the high frequency of anhidrosis in patients with UCOL. This apparent

paradox was explained by poral occlusion causing sweat leaking
and subsequent reaction.” In our study, as it is depicted in
Table II, we did not have any patients with hypo- or anhidrosis
and did not find any difference in the time to the appearance of
sweat with the response to omalizumab. This fact makes it less
likely to have a sweat allergen mechanism.

Statistically significant differences were not observed between
the placebo and active intervention groups during the blinded
period (first 4 months of the study). Despite what is a negative
result at 16 weeks, the data are useful to present in the literature
as a real-world experience of omalizumab therapy in UCOL. It
suggests a slow onset of effect, contrary to several retrospective
experiences, or open-label trials. The use of a larger blinded
period (>4 months) may be warranted for the treatment impact
evaluation in future studies. Overall, we found a progressive
negative challenge of the exercise challenge test, with a 31.3%
negative challenge rate at week 48, with significant improvements in the UCOL score, daily symptoms, and quality of life. In
addition, on ending treatment, the symptoms tended to reappear. Our study could contribute to the knowledge of efficacy of
omalizumab in patients suffering from UCOL not responding to
double doses of antihistamines and for whom no other treatment
is at hand, and to improve UCOL patients’ daily life. In
conclusion, this randomized mixed double-blind and open-label
placebo-controlled trial showed evidence of the safety and potential efficacy of omalizumab in patients with UCOL. Notably,
the response in UCOL is slower than that observed in chronic
spontaneous urticaria.
