Background: Proof-of-concept studies with omalizumab in
patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) have shown
significant decreases in mean urticaria activity scores (UASs).
Objective: We sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
omalizumab in patients with CIU who remain symptomatic
despite concomitant H,-antihistamine therapy.

Methods: This phase II, prospective, double-blind, placebocontrolled, dose-ranging study investigated omalizumab in
patients aged 12 to 75 years in the United States and 18 to 75
years in Germany with a UAS over 7 days (UAS7) of 12 or
greater despite antihistamine therapy. Patients were
randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive a single subcutaneous dose of 75,
300, or 600 mg of omalizumab or placebo added to a stable dose
of H,-antihistamine. The primary efficacy outcome was change
from baseline to week 4 in UAS7. Patients were followed for an
additional 12 weeks to monitor safety.

Results: Ninety patients from the United States or Germany
were enrolled. Both the 300-mg omalizumab group (—19.9 vs
—6.9, P <.001) and the 600-mg omalizumab group (—14.6 vs
—6.9, P = .047) showed greater improvement versus the placebo
group in UAS7. No meaningful difference was observed for the

75-mg omalizumab group. Similar results were seen for key
secondary end points of weekly hive and itch scores. Onset of
effect occurred after 1 to 2 weeks. Omalizumab was well
tolerated, and the incidence of adverse events was similar across
treatment groups.

Conclusion: This study demonstrated that a fixed dose of 300 or
600 mg of omalizumab provides rapid and effective treatment of
CIU in patients who are symptomatic despite treatment with H,antihistamines. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2011;128:567-73.)

Urticaria with a nonspecific cause characterized by the spontaneous emergence of wheals, angioedema, or both without
external physical stimuli is classified as chronic idiopathic
urticaria (CIU) in the United States or chronic spontaneous
urticaria in Europe if symptoms occur daily or almost daily for
more than 6 weeks.'? CIU has a significant effect on patients’
quality of life both physically and psychologically, with loss of
energy, social isolation, and emotional distress similar to that
seen in patients awaiting coronary artery bypass surgery.**

In approximately half of the patients with CIU, no cause for the
condition has been identified”; however, approximately 30% to
50% of patients with CIU reportedly produce IgG autoantibodies
against either IgE or its high-affinity receptor (FceRI).” Crosslinking autoantibodies directed against the a-subunit of FceRI
lead to histamine release through degranulation of cutaneous
mast cells and blood basophils.®” A subgroup of patients who exhibit IgE autoantibodies against thyroperoxidase has also recently
been identified. Although autoantibodies are considered to play a
role in the cause of certain subtypes of CIU, autoantibodies have
also been found in patients without CIU, and their clinical significance remains unclear.*!°

Current guidelines for the treatment of CIU recommend a
stepwise approach beginning with nonsedating H,-antihistamines
(nsAHs)'' and then increasing the dose of nsAH up to 4-fold if
symptoms persist before changing to a different nsAH or adding
a leukotriene antagonist.''"'? If symptoms do not abate with any
of these interventions, the guidelines recommend adding cyclosporin A, an H>-antihistamine, dapsone, or omalizumab. Cyclosporine has been shown to be effective when administered with
an nsAH,'* but concerns about potential toxicities preclude it
from being recommended as standard treatment.'’ Data on the
combination of H,- and H),-antihistimines is favorable but

Omalizumab is a recombinant mAb that is approved for the
treatment of moderate-to-severe persistent asthma in patients
with a positive skin test response or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and symptoms that are inadequately controlle
with inhaled corticosteroids (in the United States) or inhaled corticosteroids plus a long-acting inhaled B>-agonist (in Europe).'*!> Omalizumab blocks the binding of IgE to the FceRI
receptor on the surface of target cells, including mast cells and basophils, thus reducing receptor expression’'” and the release of
inflammatory mediators.'*

After initial case reports of beneficial effects of omalizumab in
patients with chronic urticaria,'®?° 2 proof-of-concept trials investigated omalizumab in patients with active CIU who remained
symptomatic despite antihistamine therapy.?!?? Both of these
trials used the US Food and Drug Administration—approved dosing table for asthma, determining the omalizumab dose based on
body weight and screening IgE levels.'* In each of these studies,
omalizumab improved mean urticaria activity scores (UASs) as
early as week 2, and scores continued to improve through week
16.7! Subsequently, additional case studies have reported beneficial effects for omalizumab in patients with recalcitrant
urticaria.?***

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy
and safety of omalizumab in patients with CIU who remained
symptomatic despite treatment with H,-antihistamines. Because
the mechanism of action for omalizumab in patients with CIU
might not be directly linked to IgE reduction, the study was additionally designed to determine the optimal dose of omalizumab
for the treatment of CIU.7!?

 

METHODS

MYSTIQUE was a phase II, prospective, multicenter, international (United
States and Germany), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, doseranging study of a single subcutaneous dose of omalizumab in patients with
CIU refractory to H;-antihistamines (see Table El in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). Patients were enrolled at 26 study centers in
the United States and Germany, which included academic institutions, allergy
offices, and research/clinical groups. This study was conducted in accordance
with US Food and Drug Administration regulations, the International Conference on Harmonization the E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and applicable local, state, and federal laws in the United States and Germany. All
sites obtained institutional review board approval to conduct this study and obtained written informed consent from study participants before enrolment.

Study population

The study included patients aged 12 to 75 years (in the United States) or 18 to
75 years (in Germany) with a history of CIU (>3 months) without a clearly
defined cause. At the time of screening, eligible patients had moderate-to-severe

CIU (pruritus and hives for >3 days in a 7-day period for >6 consecutive weeks)
despite treatment with an approved dose of an H,-antihistamine. Allowable
antihistamines were 10 mg of cetirizine once daily, 5 mg of levocetirizine dihydrochloride once daily, 60 mg of fexofenadine twice per day or 180 mg once
daily, 10 mg of loratadine once daily, or 5 mg of desloratadine once daily.

Patients were required to have a daily UAS of 4 or more established in the
clinic, and a diary-based UAS over 7 days (UAS7) of 12 or more during the
run-in period before randomization (day 0) despite stable doses of Hj-antihistamine. The daily UAS is a composite score (scale, 0-6) calculated as the sum
of the daily average morning and evening scores for severity of itch (0, none; 1,
mild; 2, moderate; and 3, severe) and number of hives (0, none; 1, 1-6 hives; 2,
7-12 hives; and 3, >12 hives).?°°7

Exclusion criteria included weight less than 40 kg, pregnancy or lactation,
any other skin disease associated with pruritus, treatment with omalizumab
within 12 months before screening, contraindication to diphenhydramine,
treatment with any investigational agent within 30 days of screening, any
clinically relevant major systemic disease that could potentially complicate
interpretation of study results, and inability to comply with study and followup procedures. Patients were not permitted regular use (daily/every other day)
of any of the following medications/treatments from the indicated time period
before the screening visit throughout the end of the treatment period: 3 months
prior—hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, dapsone, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, or other mAb
therapies; 6 weeks prior—doxepin; | month prior—cyclosporine; and 1 week
prior—H,-antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists. Use of systemic corticosteroids or cutaneous corticosteroids was not allowed during
the screening, run-in, or treatment phases; however, intranasal, inhaled, and
ophthalmic steroids were permitted.

Study design

The study consisted of 4 phases (Fig 1): screening (week —2 to week —1),
run-in (week —1 to day 0), treatment (day 0 through week 4), and follow-up
(week 4 through week 16). A patient’s eligibility to enter the trial was determined at the screening visit. During the run-in period, patients established
baseline symptom scores in their diaries; those with a UAS7 of 12 or more
were eligible for randomization. At day 0, patients were randomized in a
1:1:1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of 75, 300, or 600 mg of omalizumab
or placebo. Randomization was performed by using a dynamic randomization
scheme stratified by weight (<80 kg and >80 kg) and administered through an
interactive voice-response system. Patients, all study personnel, the designated evaluating physician, and the sponsor and its agents (with the exception
of the interactive voice-response system service provider) were blinded to
treatment assignment. After completing the 4-week treatment period, patients
were followed for an additional 12 weeks to collect safety data. From screening through week 4, all patients were provided 25 mg of diphenhydramine to
use as a rescue medication for pruritus relief on an as-needed basis. The maximum allowable daily dose of diphenhydramine was 75 mg in the United
States and 50 mg in Germany. Patients who required any other medications
(including systemic corticosteroids) to treat persistent/worsening disease
were discontinued from the study.

Study end points

Because frequent variation in disease intensity during the course of a day is
common, the assessment of disease activity was based on a weekly aggregate
UAS score (UAS7). The UAS7 is the sum of the daily average UAS scores
(average of morning and evening scores) over 7 days (scale, 0-42).°°?” The
primary efficacy outcome was the change in UAS7 from baseline to the end
of the treatment period (week 4).

Key secondary efficacy outcomes included the change in weekly pruritus
score and weekly score for the number of hives from baseline to week 4 in the
treatment period. The pruritus score was measured twice daily (morning and
evening) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (intense). The weekly pruritus score was
the sum of daily average (over morning and evening) pruritus scores over 7
days (range, 0-21). Similarly, the number of hives was measured twice daily
(morning and evening) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (>12 hives). The weekly

score of number of hives was the sum of the daily average scores over 7 days
(range, 0-21).

Safety outcomes included the frequency and severity of treatment-emergent
AEs and clinical laboratory measures. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic outcome measures included total omalizumab serum concentration,
maximum observed omalizumab serum concentration, and time to maximum
omalizumab serum concentration.

Statistical analyses

Study sample size calculations were based on the primary efficacy outcome
for treatment differences between omalizumab and placebo. On the basis of
the results of a previous double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, it was assumed
that the mean change in UAS7 from baseline to week 4 would be — 12.46 for
omalizumab and —1.26 for placebo, with a common SD of 10.2? Under this
assumption, 19 patients in each arm would yield approximately 90% power
to detect a difference between omalizumab and placebo with a 2-sided significance level of.05.

All efficacy outcomes were analyzed by using modified intent-to-treat
populations based on the treatment group assigned at randomization. Patients
whose postbaseline data were completely missing were not included in the
analysis. In the case of incomplete data, missing scores were imputed by using
the average of available corresponding scores in that week. If a patient’s diary
from the fourth week was missing completely, UAS7 for that week was imputed by using the last-observation-carried-forward method.

Efficacy outcomes were analyzed by using the van Elteren test stratified by
weight (<80 vs >80 kg). The van Elteren test is a nonparametric method
commonly used in continuous variables with small sample size. The 95% CIs
were obtained by using nonparametric methods for order statistics. All
pairwise comparisons for assessing differences between treatment arms were
performed by using 2 treatment groups at a time. No adjustments were made
for multiple comparisons. Safety analyses included all patients who received
any amount of study treatment (omalizumab or placebo), and patients were
grouped according to treatment received. All analyses, summaries, and
listings were performed with SAS software, version 9.1 or later (SAS Institute,
Inc, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Patient disposition

Ninety patients were randomized into the study, and all
received the assigned treatment. As a result, efficacy and safety
were evaluated on the intent-to-treat population. Nine (10.0%)
patients discontinued before the end of the treatment period (week
4, Fig 2). The majority of patients (n = 71 [78.9%]) completed the

follow-up period (week 16), with 6 patients discontinuing from
both the placebo (28.6%) and 75-mg omalizumab (26.1%)
groups, 2 patients (8.0%) from the 300-mg omalizumab group,
and 5 patients (23.8%) from the 600-mg omalizumab group.
The most common reason for discontinuation during the study
was disease progression (n = 5 [5.6%]), with 3 of the 5 cases occurring in the placebo group. One (1.1%) patient was treated with
an H>-antihistamine during the screening period but was inadvertently randomized to the 300-mg omalizumab group. This patient
is included in the efficacy and safety analyses.

Patients’ demographics and characteristics

The demographics of the 90 patients enrolled in this study
showed no major imbalances among the 4 treatment groups
(Table 1). The mean age was 40.8 years, and 5 (5.6%) patients
were less than 18 years of age. More than half of the patients
were female (67.8%), and the majority were white (83.3%).
Mean weight was 81.0 kg, with 43.3% of patients weighing 80
kg or more. At baseline, CIU disease characteristics were generally similar among the groups, although the UAS7 and weekly
hive score were slightly higher in the placebo group. Overall,
the mean baseline UAS7 was 28.2 (SD, 7.5) and the in-clinic
UAS was 4.4 (SD, 1.2). Use of rescue medication was low, with
a mean of 4.9 (SD, 6.4) weekly doses and a median of 2 doses
in the 7-day period before randomization.

Efficacy

The mean and median change in UAS7 showed a decrease from
baseline to week 4 in all treatment groups (Table II and Fig 3). The
300-mg and 600-mg omalizumab groups showed greater improvement than the placebo group, with a difference in mean
change from baseline in UAS7 of 13.0 points (—19.9 vs —6.9,
P <.001) and 7.7 points (— 14.6 vs —6.9, P = .047), respectively.
The 75-mg omalizumab group was not different from the placebo
group at the end of the treatment period (—9.8 vs —6.9, P = .16).
Onset of effect, as measured by mean change from baseline in
UAS7, was apparent as early as week | (the earliest time point assessed) for the 300-mg omalizumab group and continued to improve throughout the end of the treatment period (Fig 4). The
600-mg omalizumab group also demonstrated a clear separation

compared with 0% for the placebo group.

As with the primary efficacy outcome, similar results were
observed for weekly itch and hive scores, key secondary efficacy
outcomes (Table II and Fig 5). The mean change from baseline to
week 4 in the weekly itch score was —9.2 (SD, 5.98) points for the
300-mg omalizumab group (—3.5 points for placebo, P < .001)
and —6.5 (SD, 5.63) points for the 600-mg omalizumab group
(—3.5 for placebo, P = .056). During the same time period, the
mean change in weekly hive score was 10.7 (SD, 6.75) points
for the 300-mg omalizumab group (P <.001) and 8.1 (SD, 6.0)
points for the 600-mg omalizumab group (P = .02) compared
with 3.5 (SD, 5.2) points for the placebo group. No meaningful
differences between the 75-mg omalizumab and placebo groups
were observed for either the itch score (—4.5 points, P = .16)
or the hive score (—5.3 points, P = .14).

Safety and tolerability

In this study omalizumab was well tolerated, and the incidence
of AEs was similar across treatment groups. During the treatment
period (day 0 to week 4), 44.0% of patients experienced at least

1 AE (placebo: 10/21 [47.6%]; 75 mg of omalizumab: 8/23
[34.8%]; 300 mg of omalizumab: 12/25 [48.0%]; 600 mg of
omalizumab: 10/21 [47.6%]). Treatment-emergent AEs occurring
through week 4 in 5% or more of any treatment group were upper
respiratory tract infection, headache, nasopharyngitis, and dysmenorrhea; no AEs occurred in greater than 15% of patients in any
treatment group. During the follow-up period (week 4 to week 16),
40.7% of patients experienced at least 1 AE (placebo: 7/20
[35.0%]; 75 mg of omalizumab: 9/18 [50.0%]; 300 mg of
omalizumab: 12/23 [52.2%]; 600 mg of omalizumab: 5/20
[25.0%]). Treatment-emergent AEs occurring in more than | patient in any treatment group were nasopharyngitis and idiopathic
urticaria; no AEs occurred in more than 3 patients in any treatment
group during the follow-up period. During both treatment and
follow-up, the majority of AEs were mild to moderate in severity
and were considered not related to the study drug.

Four (4.4%) patients experienced AEs that led to discontinuation from the study. Three patients withdrew from the 75-mg
omalizumab group (1 case each of pregnancy, asthma, and
pruritus), and | patient withdrew from the 600-mg omalizumab
group (exacerbation of urticaria on day 70). Two (2.2%) patients
in the 75-mg omalizumab group used prednisone during the
treatment period (day 8 for CIU exacerbation and day 21 for
asthma exacerbation) and were discontinued from the study.

No serious AEs were observed during the treatment period. On
day 101, 1 patient in the 300-mg omalizumab group reported
chest pain and was hospitalized. The patient had a history of

intermittent chest pain over the previous year before enrolment in
the study, and all test results (including electrocardiograms and
cardiac enzyme measurements) were normal. The discharge
diagnosis was atypical chest pain, likely musculoskeletal, and
the investigator assessed the event as not related to the study drug.
There were no deaths during the study.

No clinically relevant laboratory findings were reported during
the study. Of the AEs of special clinical interest, there were 2
cases of hypersensitivity (1 each in the 75-mg and 600-mg
omalizumab groups). The definition of hypersensitivity was
based on a broad search for a large number of preferred terms,
which included asthma but did not include anaphylaxis, injectionsite reaction, urticaria, or skin rash. There were no observations of
anaphylaxis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, injection-site reaction,
malignancy, parasitic infection, serum sickness syndrome, or
thrombocytopenia and bleeding-related disorders during the
treatment or follow-up periods.

Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

The single dose of omalizumab was slowly absorbed, reaching
peak concentrations after a mean of 7 to 8 days. Drug concentrations were proportional across the 3 doses studied, and the
mean terminal half-life ranged from 19 to 22 days across the 3
dose groups.

DISCUSSION

In this phase II study a single dose of 300 or 600 mg of
omalizumab showed greater improvement in UAS7 from baseline
to week 4 compared with placebo, supporting previous observations that omalizumab therapy can be effective for urticaria
refractory to H,-antihistamine therapy. Both itch and hive scores
individually improved for the 300- and 600-mg doses compared
with placebo. Regardless of dose, no new safety issues or concerns were observed in patients with CIU treated with
omalizumab.

A rapid onset of action was noted for omalizumab in the
treatment of refractory CIU, which was most apparent in the 300mg dose group, with a UAS7 at week | that was approximately
two thirds of the total mean improvement noted at the end of the
treatment period. This observation contrasts with the experience
gained with omalizumab in the treatment of moderate-to-severe
allergic asthma, in which 16 weeks of treatment are recommended to demonstrate clinical response.”* Patients with CIU have
lower levels of serum IgE relative to patients with asthma, and
there is little information supporting the relationship between serum IgE levels and CIU. The results of this study suggest that flat
dosing of omalizumab might be sufficient for patients with CIU,
although further studies must be conducted to confirm this. We

postulate that the mechanism of action for omalizumab might
be through a more direct effect on mast cell/basophil reactivity
that would reduce hive generation relatively quickly instead of requiring the long-term change in the steady-state levels of serum
IgE necessary for asthma control.

The results of this phase II trial were consistent with those of 3
previous proof-of-concept trials in which multiple doses of
omalizumab were administered based on the approved dosing
regimens for asthma. Including the current study, all 4 trials
showed that omalizumab significantly improved UASs with a
rapid onset of effect and persisted for the duration of treatment.?'??° The results of these studies lend additional support to
the latest version of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology/Global Allergy and Asthma European Network/
World Allergy Organization/European Dermatology Forum
guidelines, which recommend omalizumab as a treatment option
for patients with CIU whose disease is refractory to standard
therapies.'!

A clear dose-response relationship was not seen between the
300- and 600-mg doses for either the primary or key secondary
end points. By contrast, the 75-mg omalizumab group did not
show a meaningful difference from the placebo group for either
the primary or key secondary end points. Taken together, these
data suggest that if there is a dose-dependent response to singledose omalizumab over 4 weeks, the plateau dose might lie below
the 300-mg dose; however, doses between 75 and 300 mg were
not tested in the present study.

The limitations of this study include its small sample size (90
patients randomized), the limited number of treatment groups (3
active vs placebo) and exclusion criteria regarding recent or
concomitant medications. The limited sample size might have
contributed to the observation that the improvement from baseline
in the 600-mg omalizumab group was not as pronounced as that in
the 300-mg omalizumab group when compared with the placebo
group. The single-dose design and limited follow-up time were
appropriate for this dose-ranging study, but the results do not
provide any insight into the frequency of dosing that would be
required for long-term control of CIU in this population. Additional studies are needed to investigate questions related to the
mechanism of action for omalizumab in patients with CIU and to
evaluate any effects of omalizumab on additional clinical
J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL,

outcomes, such as health-related quality of life or the need for
rescue medication.

In conclusion, consistent with the findings of 3 multiple-dose
proof-of-concept trials, the results of this randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled study demonstrate that single-dose
omalizumab (300 or 600 mg) provides rapid and effective treatment of CIU in patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment
with H,-antihistamines. Regardless of the dose of omalizumab, no
new safety issues or concerns were revealed. Future trials, including longer durations of treatment, will be necessary to fully evaluate the potential for this agent in the treatment of CIU.

assistance.

Clinical implications: Single-dose omalizumab rapidly improved urticarial symptoms (itch and hives) in patients with
antly more

H,-antihistamine-refractory CIU and was signi
effective than placebo after 4 weeks.
