Clinicoepidemiologic Features of Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria in
Patients with Elevated Plasma D-Dimer Levels versus those without It:
A Case-Control Cross-Sectional Study of 100 Indian Patients

Abstract

Background: Activated coagulation cascade is implicated in urticaria pathogenesis marked by
high plasma D-dimer, a marker of fibrinolysis, levels correlating with high urticaria activity
score (UAS) and poor therapeutic outcome. Methods: Quantitative plasma D-dimer levels and
coagulation parameters in 100 (male:female ratio 1:3) Indian patients with chronic spontaneous
urticaria and age- and gender-matched healthy controls were compared. The clinicoepidemiologic
features of chronic urticaria were then compared among patients with normal (<0.2 mg/L) and
elevated (20.3 mg/L) plasma D-dimer levels. Results: Plasma D-dimer in 23% patients and 4%
controls and prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time in 63% and 5% patients,
respectively, were significantly higher compared with 58% and 1% of controls, respectively.
About 18 of 72 (25%) patients with high UAS of >16-42 were compared with 5 of 28 (17.8%)
patients with UAS7 of <15. Patients with elevated plasma D-dimer levels had significantly more
systemic symptoms (86.9% vs. 81.8%) compared with patients with normal plasma D-dimer levels.
Conclusion: A subset of patients with chronic urticaria have elevated plasma D-dimer levels and
exhibit higher UAS7 and systemic symptoms that may influence long-term prognosis and therapeutic
choices. Small number of patients, a cross-sectional nature of study, lack of treatment outcome
measures, information on self-medication, and unavailability of specific parameters for coagulation
pathway activation remain few limitations of this study.

Introduction

While urticaria affects 15%-20% of
population at least once or more during
a lifetime, the prevalence of chronic
spontaneous urticaria characterized by
continuous or recurrent urticarial wheals
with or without angioedema for 6 weeks
or more is estimated at 0.5%-1% in
adults significantly affecting the quality
of life."?] Women are affected more often
than men, and most patients are between
20 and 40 (mean 33 years) years of age."
Recurrences are common for months or
years in about 30% of patients.) Focal
bacterial, viral and parasitic infections,
foods, drugs, inhalants, systemic diseases,
and stress are frequently implicated

Chauhan, et a/.: Chronic spontaneous urticaria and plasma D-dimer

corresponding to the severity of disease compared with
positive autologous serum skin testing (ASST) in 50%
of patients suggests activation of coagulation pathway in
the pathogenesis of chronic urticaria."'?'*! Low-affinity
IgE receptor (FceRII) autoantibodies have been shown
to activate eosinophils to cause mast cell degranulation
through release of major basic protein.''4! Eosinophils
express tissue factor and activate the extrinsic coagulation
pathway resulting in conversion of prothrombin to
thrombin by activated factor X generating PF, ,, during
the process."5!°1 The thrombin thus generated causes
urticaria by increasing vascular permeability and plasma
extravasation followed by degranulation of skin mast
cells.'""91 Thrombin also acts on fibrinogen to convert it
into fibrin that is finally degraded by plasmin to produce
fibrin degradation products and plasma D-dimer which
can be a possible biomarker for disease severity both for
acute and chronic urticaria. This appears plausible given
that patients responding to omalizumab therapy too have
shown a decrease in elevated plasma D-dimer levels
parallel to clinical response when compared with that
in nonresponders.”°*?! Furthermore, these patients also
showed better therapeutic response to heparin, tranexamic
acid, or cyclosporine than antihistamines alone.?°*4] We
evaluated plasma D-dimer levels in Indian patients with
chronic urticaria and their clinicoepidemiologic features.
The knowledge will be useful for patients and clinicians
alike for choice of treatment modalities in terms of need
to recommend antihistamines in higher than recommended
doses, addition of immunomodulator drugs, heparin,
tranexamic acid, or use of omalizumab just on the basis
of signs and symptoms alone for improved therapeutic
outcome and long-term prognosis in patients with raised
D-dimer levels.

Materials and Methods

One hundred patients (male: female ratio of 1:3) aged
18-69 (mean + SD 36.12 + 10.9) years with chronic
spontaneous urticaria not responding to recommended

doses of antihistamines, and equal number of age- and
gender-matched healthy adult controls not on any
medication were studied between April 2016 and March
2017. An episode of urticaria was defined as several
days of urticarial signs and symptoms with intervening
asymptomatic and urticaria-free days. Disease activity
and severity grading were calculated on the basis of
urticaria activity score (UAS) 7 [Table 1].!'?5! Patients with
inducible urticaria, urticarial vasculitis, acute urticaria,
systemic diseases (abnormal thyroid function, hepatorenal,
hematological, infective or autoimmune disorders), or
on medications (aspirin, clopidogrel, warfarin, heparin,
antihistamines, corticosteroids, omalizumab) that could
influence the course of urticaria or coagulation/fibrinolysis
pathway, and pregnant/lactating women were excluded
from the study after detailed clinical history/examination,
provocation tests, and relevant investigations such as
complete blood counts, thyroid and hepatorenal function
tests, antithyroid peroxidase antibodies, fasting blood
glucose estimation, HBsAg, and antistreptolysin O titer,
tests for antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor,
urinalysis, and stool microscopy for ova/cysts. Other
laboratory tests in all patients with urticaria included
C-reactive protein (CRP) and absolute eosinophil
count (AEC), the possible biomarkers of inflammation and
coagulation pathway and urticaria activity.

Plasma D-dimer levels were estimated quantitatively in
all patients and controls by immunometric flow through
method using NycoCard test kits (Nycomed Pharma,
Oslo, Norway) as per manufacturer’s instructions.
Plasma D-dimer levels >0.3 mg/L were considered
elevated (normal levels <0.2 mg/L as per manufacturer’s
manual). Coagulation parameters such as_ thrombin
time (TT), prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial
thromboplastin time (aPTT) were assayed in all study
subjects by the use of calcium thromboplastin to measure
the clotting time of the patient’s plasma using STA
Compact® and STA-R® Neoplastine kit marketed by

with that of a normal standard.

The patients were divided into two groups, Group A and
Group B, for comparison of clinicoepidemiological features
on the basis of patients with elevated and normal plasma
D-dimer levels, respectively.

Statistical analysis

Median + interquartile range (IQR) was calculated in case of
extreme values with wide and uneven distribution (outliers
and non-normal data). Mann-Whitney U test was used
to compare nonparametric and unevenly distributed data.

Chi-square test and Student’s t-test were used for statistical
analysis of the categorical and parametric data, respectively.
A P value < 0.05 calculated at 5% level (95% confidence
limit) was considered statistically significant.

Results

The baseline clinicodemographic and investigative data
for D-dimer and coagulation profile of all patients and
controls are shown in Table 2. The majority of [68 (68%)]
patients were between 18 and 40 years of age with
higher prevalence in women. The duration of urticaria

Chauhan, et al.: Chronic spontaneous urticaria and plasma D-dimer

the majority [85 (85%)] of patients had urticaria for less
than 12 months. The age at onset of urticaria ranged from
3 to 69 (mean + SD = 33.5 + 11.4) years and 84 (84%)
patients started having urticaria at 21-50 years. Only
23 (23%) patients and 4 (4%) controls had elevated plasma
D-dimer levels of 20.3 mg/L and the difference was
statistically significant (P < 0.0001). The mean values for
PT (15.00 + 2.92 vs. 14.27 + 1.93), aPTT (33.15 + 5.25 vs.
31.66 + 4.90), and TT (17.04 + 0.72 vs. 16.92 + 0.86) were
significantly higher in patients than controls (P < 0.05).

Table 3 depicts comparative clinicoepidemiologic features
of patients with elevated plasma D-dimer (Group A) and
normal values (Group B) with no statistically significant
difference in age, gender, age at onset, duration, and mean

number (52.8 + 46.9 vs. 70 + 37.2 episodes per year) of
recurrences of urticaria and/or angioedema. Eighteen of
23 (78.3%) patients with higher UAS7 of >16-42 had
significantly elevated plasma D-dimer levels compared with
5 of 23 (21.7%) patients with UAS7 of <15 (P = 0.0001).

Except for a statistically significant higher percentage, 19
of 23 (82.6%) patients in Group A showing increased PT

coagulation parameters did not differ significantly in both
the groups [Table 4]. There was no statistically significant
difference in CRP or AECs in patients in both the groups.

Clinically, one or more additional systemic symptoms
were present in 20 (86.9%) and 63 (81.8%) patients in

The significantly higher mean levels of PT, aPTT, and TT
in patients indicates activation of extrinsic with intrinsic
coagulation cascade in patients with chronic urticaria.
Similarly, activation of coagulation pathway has been
reported by other researchers marked by significantly
higher levels of D-dimer, a marker of fibrinolysis, and
plasma PF, , ,, marker of thrombin generation, in patients
with chronic urticaria corresponding to disease severity
and UAS."?+!5263°1 Increased levels of plasma D-dimer and

Chauhan, et a/.: Chronic spontaneous urticaria and plasma D-dimer

pathway in urticaria.°’°*! The higher plasma D-dimer levels
in our 23% of patients compared with 4% of controls with
a Statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) also gives
credence to these observations.

Urticaria is reportedly more severe in patients with higher
plasma D-dimer levels and is seen to correspond with
severe urticaria compared with mild disease. A positive
correlation between disease severity and elevated plasma
D-dimer levels in 48.3% of patients was observed as the
levels decreased with reduced urticaria severity in three
patients under follow-up in a_ study." Urticaria also
appears resistant to antihistamines in patients with high
plasma D-dimer levels and said to improve or show better
therapeutic response to treatment with heparin or tranexamic
acid, a plasminogen activation inhibitor." The significantly
higher UAS7 of =16-46 in 18 of 72 (25%) patients with
elevated plasma D-dimer levels and in greater percentage
of patients, 78.3% in Group A, also reflects an association
between disease severity and elevated plasma D-dimer
levels. Similar observations have been made previously
as well.!'53°1 Asero et ail.''’! observed moderate to severe
disease activity in 75% and 38% of patients showing
elevated and normal plasma D-dimer levels, respectively.
Takahagi ef al.?! also observed above normal levels of
plasma D-dimer in 35% of patients with chronic urticaria
and its severity correlating with fibrin degradation products
and plasma D-dimer levels. The systemic symptoms in
our 86.9% of Group A patients were significantly higher
compared with 81.8% of patients in Group B. Although
the difference was not statistically significant, general
symptoms of being unwell, gastrointestinal symptoms,
feeling of hot and cold, flushing, and joint pains were more
frequent in Group A patients, whereas cardiorespiratory
symptoms were comparatively more frequent in Group B
patients.

Limitations

Small number of patients, a cross-sectional nature of
study, unavailability of specific parameters to determine
coagulation pathway activation, and lack of information on
self-medication are some of the limitations of this study.
Treatment outcome measures were not part of the study.

Conclusion

It appears that a subset of patients with chronic spontaneous
urticaria have coagulation cascade activation marked by
elevated plasma D-dimer levels and exhibit a higher UAS
and systemic symptoms. On the contrary, blood levels of
eosinophils may not be elevated as was also observed in
both the groups in this study, and positive CRP was found
only in a minority of our patients as was also seen in a
previous study suggesting a reduced sensitivity of these
parameters.''°?) In light of our observations, we tend to
agree with Farres ef a/.?7 that plasma D-dimer and PF, , ,
may be useful for monitoring disease activity despite a

weak correlation between UAS and plasma D-dimer levels.
However, the exact role of D-dimer in predicting disease
activity needs to be elucidated further after large systematic
studies and long-term post treatment follow-up given that
our 77% of patients also had normal levels.
