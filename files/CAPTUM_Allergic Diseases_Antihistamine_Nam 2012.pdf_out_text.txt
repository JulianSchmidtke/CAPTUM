Purpose: Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common and debilitating disease, and the need for effective treatment has increased. Omalizumab may be an
alternative regimen in patients with CU who do not respond to conventional treatments. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and to
observe the clinical results of omlizumab in patients with refractory CU. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 26 patients with refractory CU who were treated with omalizumab. Omalizumab was administered every 2 or 4 weeks, depending on body weight and the total serum
IgE level, for 24 weeks. Results: Fourteen patients (53.8%) achieved remission after the treatment; they had a significantly higher prevalence of
personal (P=0.033) and family history of allergic diseases (P=0.002) than those who did not achieve remission. During omalizumab treatment, the
urticaria activity score declined significantly (12.11+1.97 to 2.74.23; P=0.001) and the CU-quality of life score improved significantly (34.65 +
13.58 to 60.88 + 11.11; P=0.004). There were significant decreases in the use of systemic steroids (42.3%-11.5%; P=0.027) and immunomodulators
(65.4%-19.2%; P=0.002). The dose of antihistamines required to control CU also decreased significantly (215.66 + 70.06 to 60.85 + 70.53 mg/week
of loratadine equivalents; P<0.001). No serious adverse event was noted. Conclusions: These findings suggest that omalizumab can be an effec
 

tive and safe treatment in patients with refractory CU.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a skin disorder characterized by the
recurrent appearance of wheals and/or angioedema for more
than 6 weeks.'* CU accounts for 25% of urticarial,” and the prevalence of CU is 0.1%-0.6%.** Almost 40% of CU patients continue to experience urticarial wheals 10 years later.* CU has detrimental effects on the quality of life (QOL) and is associated with
poorer general health and reduced emotional well-being;** As
a result, CU has a large impact on society in terms of healthcare
costs.°"” Patients with refractory CU do not respond to standard
treatments with antihistamines or additional immunomodulators that are, in a few cases, unsafe when used for prolonged
times.

CU is a heterogeneous disorder and includes idiopathic, autoimmune, and physical urticaria and vasculitis.'' For more than
50% of patients with CU, the underlying cause has not been identified.’* However, up to one-third of patients with chronic idio

pathic urticaria have autoantibodies to FceRI (a high-affinity receptor for IgE), and about 10% have IgE autoantibodies.'* These
autoantibodies can cause mast cell degranulation, and most
CU symptoms result from the degranulation of skin mast cells.
Omalizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody, forms a biologically inert molecule with free IgE."* Omalizumab selectively binds to the C3 domain of the IgE heavy chain,
where IgE binds to FcéRI, and inhibits the reactions between
anti-IgE and IgE-sensitized mast cells; thus, it can improve CU
symptoms. Omalizumab was shown to be dramatically effec

tive in chronic autoimmune urticaria," chronic idiopathic urticaria,'®"’ and various urticaria subtypes such as cholinergic, cold,
solar, and non-autoimmune urticarial, as well as CU with IgE
autoantibodies against thyroperoxidase.'*” In the present study,
we evaluated the efficacy and safety of omalizumab, and observed the clinical course of omalizumab treatment in 26 patients with refractory CU.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

We conducted a retrospective study of patients who were treated with omalizumab for refractory CU. Patients with refractory
CU were defined as having symptoms for at least 6 weeks with
persistent hives, and not controlled most days of the week, despite the use of a fourth-line therapy for more than 4 weeks, according to EAACI/GALEN guidelines.’® Omalizumab was administered subcutaneously every 2 or 4 weeks for 24 weeks,
dosed according to the patient’s body weight and total serum
IgE levels as described in previous studies.'"”° Atopy was defined
as a positive skin prick test with at least one common aeroallergen or the presence of serum-specific IgE against at least one.

Urticaria activity score (UAS) and chronic urticaria-specific
QOL (CU-QOL) questionnaires were completed every 4 weeks.
The UAS (total score range, 0-15, with higher scores indicating
higher disease activity) was measured using a combination of
pruritus and four characteristics of wheals, including number,
distribution range, mean diameter, and duration.”' The patient’s
health-related QOL was evaluated using a previously validated
scoring system, the CU-QOL, comprising 17 items (total score
range, 0-68, with higher scores indicating higher QOL).” Medications were prescribed and stepped down with monitoring every 4 weeks following the EAACI/GALEN guidelines.” In patients who achieved remission, the medications were stepped
down. Drug requirements for antihistamines and steroids were
calculated as described previously.” Daily doses of H1-antihistamine drugs for the treatment of CU were calculated based on
the equivalent dose of loratadine (10 mg/day), and the required
antihistamine doses were calculated from the total antihistamine
doses used for the control of CU during 4 weeks, presented as
the equivalent dose (mg/week) of loratadine for the H1 antihistamine. Immunomodulators used included leukotriene receptor antagonists, cyclosporine, hydroxychloroquine, and colchicine.

The responses to omalizumab were described as follows: remission, defined as a condition with no symptoms and no requirement for medications for at least 4 weeks; responsive, defined as a step-down of more than one level of therapy compared with the baseline; and refractory, defined as neither remission nor any symptom improvement during the treatment
period. The protocol for the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the hospital (AJIRB-MED-OBS-11-300).

Statistical analysis

Quantitative and qualitative results are expressed as the means
standard deviation (SD) and absolute numbers or frequencies, respectively. Descriptive statistics were performed using
SPSS software ver. 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical
significance was assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test and
Wilcoxon signed rank test for continuous variables and Fisher's
exact test for categorical variables. Values of P<0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.

RESULTS

Patient characteristics

Twenty-six patients were enrolled in the present study. The
mean age was 43.1+8.4 years, and 14 patients (53.8%) were
men. The mean disease duration of CU was 63+72.7 months.
Seventeen subjects (68%) had atopy, 16 (61.5%) had nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) hypersensitivity, and half
of the subjects had angioedema or physical urticaria. Anti-nuclear antibody was detected in five patients (19.2%); antithyroglobulin antibody, in six patients (23.1%); and antimicrosomal
antibody, in one patient (7.7%). The mean total IgE level was
247.7 + 274.6 kU/mL.

Changes in the UAS, CU-QOL, and medication requirements

The UAS [12.11+1.97 to 3.0+4.28 at week 12 (P=0.001) and
to 2.7+4.23 at week 24 (P=0.001)] decreased significantly, while
the CU-QOL score [34.65 + 13.58 to 62.59+8.71 at week 12 (P=
0.001) and to 60.88 + 11.11 at week 24 (P=0.004)] improved significantly during omalizumab treatment (Fig. 1). Eight of 11
subjects (72.7%, P=0.027) discontinued systemic steroid use,
and 12 of 17 (70.6%, P=0.002) discontinued the use of any immunomodulator. The requirements for H1-antihistamines decreased significantly (215.66 +70.06 to 60.85+70.53 mg/week
of loratadine equivalents; P< 0.001; Fig. 2).

Treatment outcomes

Twenty-two patients (84.6%) achieved remission during 24
weeks (remitted group). Ten patients achieved remission at
week 4; four, at week 12; three, at weeks 8 and 16; and one, at
weeks 20 and 24 (total mean, 9.27+6.1 weeks). In the remitted
group, 14 (53.8%) maintained remission throughout the 24week treatment period. However, symptoms recurred in eight
(30.8%) of these subjects; the mean period for recurrence was
11 weeks (range, 4-20 weeks). Five (19.2%) maintained their
baseline therapy, and the other three (11.6%) achieved stepdown therapy. The causes of recurrence were alcohol (two cases), drugs (one case), coldness (two cases), and unknown causes
(three cases). No significant differences were observed in clinical parameters, including age, gender, disease duration, atopy,
angioedema, physical urticaria, and baseline UAS and CU-QOL
score, or in medication schedules between the recurrent and
remission maintenance groups. In the non-remitted group (n=
4, 15.4%), two (7.7%) achieved step-down therapy and two
(7.7%) were still refractory to omalizumab. One refractory patient had atopy and a history of NSAID hypersensitivity, and the
other had atopic dermatitis. In total, 19 patients (73.1%) were
responsive to omalizumab (Fig. 3).

No severe adverse events were observed during the treatment
period. Only mild and tolerable adverse events were noted: facial rash (one case), dyspepsia (one case), weight loss (one case),
and generalized edema (one case). All patients successfully fin

Comparison of clinical parameters according to the response to
omalizumab

The patients were divided into two groups according to whether they achieved remission at week 24:14 subjects with remission (group I) and 12 subjects without remission (group II; Table). No significant difference in age, gender, disease duration,
atopy, angioedema, physical urticaria, or baseline UAS or CUQOL score was observed between the groups. However, group I
had a significantly higher prevalence of personal or family history of allergic diseases compared with group II (P=0.033 and
P=0.002, respectively). NSAID hypersensitivity was higher in
group II, although the difference was not significant (P=0.051).
When comparing the responsive group with the unresponsive
group, no significant difference was detected, except that the
baseline CU-QOL score was lower in the responsive group (29.69
+11.11 vs. 50.75+6.13, P=0.002; data not shown).

DISCUSSION

CU, one of the most frequent skin allergy diseases, is a heterogeneous condition, and prognostic factors for each treatment
are not well known. Symptomatic treatment for CU is the most
frequently used form of management, and a step-wise approach
is recommended.” First-line therapy with an antihistaminebased regimen may not achieve satisfactory control in 5% to as
many as 50% of patients with CU.“” Those with refractory CU
require the addition of cyclosporine, dapsone, or omalizumab
to H1-antihistamines, and frequent exacerbations are treated

with systemic steroids. However, the toxicities and adverse events
associated with cyclosporine and long-term steroid exposure
should be considered carefully.'°”* Thus, a continuing need exists for effective and safe treatments for refractory CU; trials of
several novel therapeutics are in progress.

Recent studies have demonstrated favorable effects of omalizumab in patients with refractory CU. Omalizumab significantly improved the UAS, health-related QOL, and medication use,
with a rapid onset of effects that persisted for the duration of
treatment.'*!°”°”’ The onset of effects occurred after 1-2 weeks,'°
and greater than 50% improvement in health-related QOL was
noted.'*” In the present study, when we analyzed 26 patients
with refractory CU, the effects, including improvement in the
UAS, CU-QOL score, and medication use, were comparable to
previous findings.'*!”*? However, in eight patients, urticaria
symptoms recurred during the treatment period, and medications had to be restarted to control the symptoms, which in half
of these subjects recurred at week 24. These findings suggest
that although long-term study results are needed, omalizumab
may be considered as an alternative regimen for controlling refractory CU in patients who do not respond to conventional
treatments.

A longer duration of disease, concurrent angioedema, the
combination with physical urticaria, and a positive autologous
serum skin test (ASST) are related to severe CU.” While all patients with mild CU were symptom-free after 2 years, more than
30% of patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms appeared
to continue to suffer at 5 years.” At least 50% of patients with
CU have angioedema,” one-third show a positive response on
the ASST,*’ and the prevalence of CU in combination with
physical urticaria is 10% to 50%.*** These patients were more
severely affected and had a longer disease duration.***** Generally, omalizumab could induce clinical remission in 50%-70%
of Western patients with CU.'*”° However, no report has suggested any prognostic factors for predicting the response to omalizumab. In the present study, 53.8% of the patients achieved remission after omalizumab treatment, and half of them exhibited angioedema and physical urticaria. The presence of angioedema, physical urticaria, and the duration of disease were not
related to treatment response. Instead, we found a significantly
higher prevalence of personal or family history of allergic diseases in the remitted group than in the non-remitted group, indicating that a personal or family history of allergic diseases may
be a favorable factor for predicting remission after omalizumab
treatment in refractory CU.

Neither severe adverse reactions nor death have been reported in previous studies. Kaplan et al.'® reported no adverse effects.
In another study, the rate of adverse events was similar between
the omalizumab and placebo groups; the most frequent adverse
events were diarrhea, followed by nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory infection, and headache.” In the present study, minimal adverse reactions were reported in four cases, and no pa

tient discontinued omalizumab treatment.

In conclusion, omalizumab is an effective and safe treatment
for patients with refractory CU. The findings suggest that a personal or family history of allergic diseases may be a favorable
factor for predicting remission. Further studies will be needed
to investigate potential factors for differentiating favorable and
unfavorable responders.
