Abstract

Mast cells play a central role in the pathogenesis of many allergic disorders. They can be activated in different
ways. The present study was focused to evaluate the role of mast cells in acquired chronic urticaria-angioedema
induced by gastroesophageal reflux. Tryptase, an important marker of mast cell activation, was detected with
UniCap™ Tryptase Fluoroenzymeimmunoassay (Pharmacia & Upjohn AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Eight subjects were
studied: four males and four females, aged between 29 and 71 years (mean age: 45 yrs.), suffering from acquired
chronic urticaria-angioedema. Results were compared with the results of seven healthy control subjects. Moreover,
data were compared with those of 13 subjects (10 males and 3 females, mean age: 24.7 years) suffering from allergic
rhinitis. In acquired chronic urticaria-angioedema, serum tryptase levels (mean + S.D.: 9.6 + 4.3 ug/l) were significantly higher (P < 0.007) than those of the controls (mean + S.D.: 3.0 + 1.2 pg/I) and higher also than in allergic
rhinitis (mean + S.D.: 6142.4 pg/I, P<0.03). The results underline the central role of mast cells in the
inflammation of acquired chronic urticaria-angioedema. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction

In a high number of cases the origin of the
acquired chronic urticaria-angioedema is not
known (Kaplan, 1993; Greaves, 1996). Our previous studies demonstrated that idiopathic acquired
chronic urticaria-angioedema syndrome (UAS)
may be often induced by unusual different factors
that have been underestimated or slightly considered for too long a time. These are the focal
diseases, exercise-induced anaphylaxis, or gastroesophageal reflux (Serafini and Coari, 1945;
Bruno et al., 1981; Bruno, 1982, 1984; Bruno et
al., 1993, 1996, 1997a). Independent of the kind of
trigger factors, the inflammation of acquired
chronic UAS is characterized by the involvement
of several cells and different mediators that are
released by immunological or non-immunological
mechanisms. Mast cells play a central role in the
pathogenesis of many allergic disorders and they
can be activated in different ways. Recent studies
have stressed the potential of the neutral proteases to act as important mediators of allergic
inflammation (Schwartz and Huff, 1998), as our
previous studies showed also in allergic rhinitis
(Andreozzi et al., 1998, 1999).

Tryptase is considered to be an important specific marker of mast cell activation induced by
several and different triggers. Up to now few data
are available that concern the role of mast cells in
pathophysiological events that characterize inflammation of acquired chronic UAS. The present study was devoted to evaluate mast cells
activation in acquired chronic UAS.

2. Patients and methods

Eight subjects were studied: four males and
four females, aged between 29 and 71 years (mean
age: 45yrs.), suffering from acquired chronic idiopathic UAS. Results were compared with the
results of seven healthy control subjects and with
13 subjects (10 males and 3 females, mean age:
24.7 years) suffering from perennial allergic rhinitis which was diagnosed by characteristic history,
skin prick test and RAST.

Tryptase FEIA test. Ten millilitres peripheral

blood venipuncture sample was collected from
each patient with acquired chronic UAS, from
each subject with perennial allergic rhinitis, and
from healthy control subjects. The samples were
centrifuged at 1500 rev./min for 10 min at room
temperature in order to aliquot sera which were
stored at —20°C. The test (Schwartz, 1994) was
performed by UniCap™ tryptase fluoroenzymeimmunoassay (Pharmacia & Upjohn AB,
Uppsala, Sweden). Anti-tryptase, covalently coupled to immunoCap, reacted with tryptase in the
patient serum sample. After washing, enzymelabelled antibodies against tryptase were added to
form a complex. After incubation, unbound enzyme-anti-tryptase was washed away and the
bound complex was then incubated with a developing agent. After the reaction was stopped, the
fluorescence in the eluate was measured. Fluorescence was directly proportional to the concentration of tryptase in the serum sample. A UniCap
100 instrument was programmed to calculate data
automatically from the UniCap tryptase assay.

2.1. Statistical analysis

The blood samples were collected always at the
same time to avoid possible variables owing to the
circadian change. Results were analyzed by ‘unpaired t-test’. Probability (P) values < 0.05 were
considered to be significant.

3. Results

No one of the patients with acquired chronic
UAS showed factors related to the most common
causes of urticaria-angioedema (such as drugs,
foods, insect venom, complement deficiency, etc.).
However, the evaluation of other ‘unusual’ trigger factors showed that all the subjects were also
suffering from characteristic symptoms related to
gastroesophageal disorders, such as heartburn,
pyrosis, epigastric pain, and regurgitation, alone
or in any combination. The upper intestinal endoscopy in all the cases showed the presence of
gastroesophageal reflux (GER) with or without
esophagitis of the lower tract, which was related
to the incompetence of the lower sphincter or

hiatal hernia. GER was associated to antrum
gastritis in two cases, to duodenal peptic ulcer in
one case, and to esophageal diverticulum case.
Two out of eight cases showed the presence of
Helicobacter pylori (Table 1).

The healthy control subjects (mean age 30.4
years, range 17-35, 3 males and 2 females) did
not have a personal or relative history of atopy
and the allergic tests for IgE-mediated diseases
were negative in vivo and in vitro.

In perennial allergic rhinitis patients, diagnosis
was based on the characteristic history with symptoms of sneezing, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhoea,
nasal itching. The skin prick test and the RAST
showed a high degree of sensibility to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (D.pt.) in all
patients.

4. Discussion and conclusions

Acquired chronic urticaria-angioedema often
causes considerable domestic, personal, recreational, social, and emotional handicaps (O’Donnell
et al., 1997). Moreover, the causes of acquired
UAS are considered unknown in a high percentage of cases. For these reasons urticaria and
angioedema are often frustrating for patients as
they go from one physician to another in hope of
finding an extraordinary physician who will be
able to identify the cause, eliminate the culprit,
and thus cure their hives (Charlesworth, 1996).
However, our previous study (Andreozzi et al.,
1996; Bruno et al., 1997b,c, 1998) demonstrated
that the occurrence of idiopathic urticariaangioedema is not so frequent as it is reported
(Kaplan, 1993; Greaves, 1996).

The patients selected for the study should be in
the big group of idiopathic UAS, because the
usual findings to ascertain this etiology were negative. But other symptoms reported by patients
were typically to relate with a disorder of the
gastroesophageal tract, as was demonstrated by
the upper intestinal endoscopy. It is well known
that GER is often the cause of a spectrum of
diseases, including UAS (Bruno et al., 1998;
80 G. Bruno et al. / The Science of the Total Environment 270 (2001) 77-81

Castell, 1994; Debonne et al., 1994; Heading,
1994), and it is induced often by physical exercise
(Clark et al., 1989). In predisposed individuals,
inflammation induced by GER is similar to that
mediated by immune reactions. The participation
of several and different cells characterize inflammation, they release many biologically active
substances. Also, mast cells are involved in inflammation. Our results confirmed the central
role of mast cells also in the pathophysiology of
acquired chronic urticaria-angioedema, as the increase of tryptase serum levels showed. Moreover, in acquired chronic UAS, mast cell activation seems to be significantly greater than in
allergic rhinitis. Our data showed that mast cells
can be activated in a way different from nonIgE-mediated mechanisms. In our patients the
trigger factor of acquired chronic UAS was GER.
It must be considered that low molecular weight
peptides, including neuropeptides, complement
components, nerve growth factor, opioid peptides
and histamine releasing cytokines could activate
mast cells independently of FCeRI. These may
well have an amplifying role (Greaves and
O’Donnell, 1997).

In skin there is good evidence that the wheal
and flare response may be mediated by an axon
reflex involving retrograde release of sensory neuropeptides such as Substance P. This is localized
to afferent nerves in skin, and intradermal injection of this peptide causes a flare (due to local
vasodilatation) and also a wheal, which may be
due to histamine release from mast cells, confirmed by a rise in plasma histamine in the draining vein (Heavy et al., 1985; Barnes, 1986). There
is evidence that axon reflexes can also be involved
in the gastrointestinal tract, as they occur in
‘gastric asthma’ (Mays, 1976; Bruno et al., 1999).
Since airways are derived embryologically from
the gut, and there are many similarities in innervation, it would not be surprising if axon reflexes
also operated in airways, skin and mucosa.

The neuropeptides like substance P and neurokinin A, members of the tachikinins, both released by sensory nerves, own potent effects on
inflammation that involve different patterns of
cells including immune cells (Maggi et al., 1995).
Moreover, mast cells have been shown to release

nerve growth factor or brain-derived neurotrophic
factor, which are potent regulators of neuropeptide synthesis (McGillis et al., 1987; Fischer and
Hoffmann, 1996). The high number of immunocompetent cells in the vagus nerve and in the
vagal sensory ganglia indicate further functional
interactions, that so far are only poorly understood (Fischer and Kummer, 1998).

Finally the occurrence of Helicobacter pylori is
also considered. Helicobacter pylori could act as
an inducer or an amplifying agent of neurogenic
inflammation. Recently Helicobacter pylori has
been related to acquired C1-INH deficiency in a
patient with angioedema (Farkas et al., 1999).
Further studies are necessary to evaluate the role
of neurogenic inflammation and Helicobacter pylori in acquired chronic UAS induced by GER.
