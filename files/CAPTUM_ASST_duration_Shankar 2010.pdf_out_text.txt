Abstract

Background:

In 1769, William Cullen introduced the word “urticaria” (transient edematous papules, plaque with
itching). Urticaria affects 15-25% of people at least once in their life time. It is a clinical reaction pattern
triggered by many factors causing the liberation of vasoactive substances such as histamine, prostaglandins
and kinins. Urticaria is classified according to its duration into acute (< 6 weeks duration) and chronic (>6
weeks duration). Various clinical investigations may be initiated to diagnosis the cause.

Aims:

To evaluate the types of chronic urticaria with reference to etiology from history and investigations.

Materials and Methods:

A total of 150 patients with chronic urticaria of more than six weeks were studied. Autologous serum skin
test (ASST) was performed after physical urticarias were excluded. Standard batteries of tests were
performed after ASST in all patients; and other specific investigations were done where necessary. Skin
prick test was done in idiopathic urticaria.

Results:

The study sample consisted of 62 male and 88 female patients with a mean age of 21-40 years. About 50%
of patients showed an ASST positive reaction, 3.9% were positive for antinuclear antibody (ANA), IgE
titer was elevated in 37%, H. pylori antibodies was positive in 26.7%. Thyroid antibodies were positive in
6.2%. Giardia and entamoeba histolytica was reported in 3.3% on routine stool examination and on
urinalysis 8% had elevated WBC counts; 12% showed para nasal sinusitis, with maxillary sinusitis of
7.3%. Random blood sugar was high in 5.3%. Four patients had ASOM, two had positive KOH mount for
dermatophytes, abdominal USG showed cholecystitis in two patients. Recurrent tonsillitis was noted in
two patients. Urticaria following intake of NSAIDs was observed in four patients and with oral

contraceptive pills in one patient. Contact urticaria to condom (latex) was seen in one patient. Cholinergic
(4.7%) and dermographic (4.7%) urticaria were the predominant physical urticarias. Prick test was
performed in idiopathic urticaria with maximum reactions to food antigens (25%) where brinjal was the
commonest, 9% to dust in which spider web was the most common, 8% to pollen where parthenium and
amaranthus were the commonest, followed by A. flavus in fungi, pigeon in epithelia and cockroach in
insects.

Conclusion:

Nearly half of the patients had chronic autoimmune urticaria on the basis of ASST. A significant number
of them had serological makers of autoimmune activity. ASST provides an easy, inexpensive investigation
in CU and helps direct attention to underlying systemic auto immune diseases. The presence of these auto
antibodies was significantly associated with more frequent and longer lasting urticarial attacks. Exhaustive
work ups with extensive laboratory diagnostics, challenge tests, and prick testing should be reserved for
individual cases following detailed history.

Introduction

In 1769, William Cullen introduced the word “urticaria” (transient edematous papule, plaque with itching).
Urticaria affects 15-25% of people at least once in their life time.[1] It is a clinical reaction pattern
triggered by many factors causing the liberation of vasoactive substances such as histamine, prostaglandins
and kinins.[2] Clinically, uritcaria is classified into acute (duration <6 weeks) and chronic (duration >6
weeks) type.[3] Etiologically, urticaria is classified broadly into immunological mediated (IgE dependent
and non-IgE dependent) and non-immunological mediated. After physical exertion as well as mechanical,
thermal or electromagnetic stimuli (cold, heat, pressure, water, UV light) various forms of physical
urticaria can occur due to non specific mast cells activation.[2] In the etiology based classification of
urticaria, the idiopathic form is where no cause is found and is the most frequent, constituting up to 70% of
cases.[2] About 30-50% of patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria have circulating histamine releasing
auto antibodies to the high affinity IgE receptor FceRI on the basophil and mast cells, or less commonly,
antibodies to IgE.[4,5] The term autoimmune urticaria is increasingly being accepted for this subgroup of
patients.[4] The autologous serum skin test (ASST) as defined by Sabroe et al.[6] is currently the best in
vivo clinical test for detection of in vitro basophil histamine releasing activity with 65-71% of sensitivity
and 78-81% specificity.

The diagnostic approach to urticaria is very broad and includes a comprehensive clinical, chemical and
serological laboratory work-up. Prick test is performed for suspected foods, food additives along with
allergy to dust, mites, fungi and epithelia. Challenge test is used to identify triggers in physical urticaria.

Materials and Methods

A prospective observational study of 150 patients including 62 male and 88 female between the age of 1070 years; with CU was conducted in the department of dermatology and venereology at Manipal Hospital,
Bangalore. Clinical details of all patients were recorded using a standard proforma and an informed
consent was taken from those who underwent investigations [Table 1]. Selected patients were subjected to
a physical challenge test and laboratory investigations based on his/her history including: X-ray of paranasal sinuses prick test with a panel of common food allergen, dust, mites, pollen, fungi.

ASST was performed as follows: About 5 ml venous blood was collected in a sterile vacutainer and
allowed to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes. Serum was sent to the clinical laboratory for
centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 15 minutes and 0.05 ml of autologous serum (test) was then injected
intradermally using a 1 ml insulin syringe (30 gauge needle) to the right forearm 2 cm below the cubital
fossa and similarly 0.05ml of 0.9% sterile normal saline (control) was injected intradermally to the left
forearm [Figures | and 2]. 0.05 ml of histamine (10 pg/ml) was injected into volar aspect of the left
forearm as a positive control. A serum induced erythematous wheal with a diameter of 1.5 mm more than
the saline induced response within 30 minutes was taken as a positive test. In all subjects, antihistamine
and steroids were withdrawn at least 72 hours and one week prior to skin test, respectively.[7]

Methodology for prick test

Prick test was performed in patients with idiopathic urticaria with history of allergic reactions to food, dust
and mites to trace out Type I hypersensitivity reaction (IgE mediated). Detailed history regarding antigens
was recorded in the proforma, and consent was obtained. Emergency drugs (for anaphylaxis) were kept
ready before starting the procedure. The preferred test sites are the back and forearms.[8] Histamine
solution (H) was used as a positive control and a buffer solution (S) was used as a negative control.
Readings were taken after 30 minutes and 60 minutes. Positive reactions manifest in the form of erythema,
wheals, papules and vesicles. Positive controls should show reactions and negative controls should not
show any reaction. Using the help of a dropper, the antigens are placed 3 cm apart and are number
according to the present code. Using a lancet a superficial prick is made 45 degrees tangentially to the skin
surface, with out bleeding or pain [Figure 3].

Interpretation of prick test
A wheal of 3 mm diameter with surrounding edema can be recorded as a positive reaction.
Exclusion criteria in this study were

1) urticaria less then 6 weeks, 2) patients taking antihistamines or steroids or any other medications, 3)
pregnant or lactating women, 4) severely ill patients and immuno-compromised patients, 5) patients with
irregular follow up.

Statistical methods

Descriptive statistical analysis has been carried out. Chi- square and Fisher Exact test have been used to
find the significant association of ASST with the ANA, Thyroid- antibodies, IgE and Helicobacter pylori.

Result

The male:female ratio among all urticaria subgroups was about 1:1.3. The average age in all urticaria
categories belonged to the reproductive age groups (20-40years). Patients <20 years old show mostly
infective focus.

ASST was performed in all patients of CU after excluding physical urticaria. 65/127 patients who
underwent ASST showed a positive reaction (51.1%). H. pylori antibodies were significantly higher
(46.2%) for ASST positive patients when compared to ASST negative patients, which show significant P
value (<0.001) [Table 2 and Graph 1]. Similarly, antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were positive in 7.7% of
patients who were ASST positive, which showed moderately significant P value (0.026). On further
investigation for autoimmune diseases systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was diagnosed in two patients.
Thyroid antibodies were present in 10.8% of patients with positive ASST, which showed moderately
significant for P value (0.034). IgE was elevated in only 35% of patients with ASST positive which is not
significant.

Giardia and E. histolytica were present in 3.3% of patients on routine stool examination. On analysis of
urine 8% of patients showed a high WBC count. Random blood sugar levels were significantly elevated in
5.3% of patients, and they were started on anti diabetic therapy following further investigations.
Gingitivitis with dental caries was observed in 10 patients. Acute suppurative otitis media (ASOM) was
present in four children with history of ear discharge. Dermatophytes were present in KOH mount from
two patients and antifungal therapy was given. The patients responded well. Throat pain with enlarged,
inflamed tonsils was noted in two patients.

In two patients with abdominal pain following fatty food intake, cholecystitis was diagnosed based on the
abdominal ultrasonogram report; 7.3% of patients showed maxillary sinusitis followed by frontal sinusitis
in 2% and ethmoidal sinusitis in 2.7%. IgE was significantly high in patients with ethmoidal sinusitis
compared to sinusitis at other sites [Table 3].

Challenge tests [Graph 2] were performed in 23 patients with clinical features of physical urticaria. 4.7%
of patients showed cholinergic urticaria, 4.7% showed symptomatic dermographism, 2% showed cold
urticaria with ice cube test, 10.2% showed delayed pressure urticaria, 1.3% showed with solar urticaria and
0.7% of patients showed localized heat Urticaria.

Skin Prick test was done in 22 patients who had idiopathic urticaria, six patients had a strongly suggestive
history of food and dusts induced aggravation and were subjected to prick testing, out of which 10 were
males and 18 females. Among them 60.7% patients showed reactions to more than five antigens, and
maximum reaction was seen for foods, followed by dust, pollen, mites, fungi, epithelia and lastly insect [
Table 4], and three patients did not show any reaction.

Discussion

Chronic Urticaria is a common disease that can persist or recur over long periods of time spanning years
causing distress and at times being life threatening. As a cause is often not found, it presents the physicians
with a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.

To evaluate the role of a comprehensive diagnostic approach, a prospective evaluation of 150 patients was
done over a period of one year. The youngest patient was a one-year-old and the oldest was 70, with mean
ages of 25- 40 years. Eighty eight patients were male. Male to female ratio was 1:1.3. The most frequent
areas of involvement were arm > back > legs. There was no significant difference between patients with or
without auto antibodies regarding sites.

There is now growing evidence that 30-50% of CIU results from an autoimmune process involving
functional histamine-releasing anti FceRI, auto antibodies or less commonly, anti IgE-autoantibodies.[9]
As patients with autoimmune antibodies have no distinctive diagnostic clinical features, current clinical
diagnosis depends on autologous serum skin test. A positive test is suggestive but not diagnostic of an
autoimmune basis.[10]

Although western blot analysis or an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test was developed to
detect auto antibodies, these tests do not distinguish functional histamine-releasing antibodies from
nonfunctional antibodies.[10] These time consuming tests are only performed in a few specialist
laboratories and are not available in our department or in majority of the dermatological clinics. It has
already been reported that the ASST with positive test being defined as one with serum induced wheals,
which is both erythematous and has a diameter of 1.5 mm greater than saline response at 30 minutes is a
reasonably predictive clinical test to reveal functional circulating antibodies with a sensitivity of 65-71%
and specificity 78-81%.[7Z] Thus we relied on ASST, the only available and practical test, to demonstrate
those patients with auto antibodies.

In our study a higher incidence H. pylori antibodies were detected in ASST positive patients in comparison
to ASST negative patients. It is postulated that H. pylori infection may induce development of pathogenic
auto antibodies by molecular mimicry.[11,12] Appelmelk et a/.[11,12] first demonstrated the molecular
mimicry between H. pylori and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) anti Lewis antibodies in autoimmune type-B
gastritis. Four per cent of patients with a positive ASST showed antinuclear antibodies and two of these
patients on further evaluation were diagnosed to have SLE.

Thyroid antibodies were observed in ASST positive patients who showed a moderately significant P value,
but any clinical abnormalities at the time of examination were not displayed. Isolated association with
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus was observed in two ASST positive patients.

In this study lesions lasting for a significantly longer duration and frequency correlated to a higher
incidence in ASST positive patients as compared to ASST negative patients.

A study by Sabroe et a/. concludes that patients with auto antibodies show frequent attacks.[9] There is a
statistically significant difference in TSH, thyroid antibodies and ANA between the ASST positive and
negative groups, indicating a correlation between a positive ASST and auto immunity. This implies that
markers of autoimmunity may be found in many types of chronic urticaria, but ASST is the only clinically
demonstrable evidence of autoimmunity. ASST positives had higher IgE titers. This may indicate
induction of autoimmunity through cross reactivity or other mechanisms in a population prone to
immunological hyper reactivity. Autoimmune disease like thyroid disease, vitilligo, diabetes mellitus,
pernicious anemia and rheumatoid arthritis were reported more commonly in patients with autoimmune
urticaria.[13] Patients with autoimmune urticaria have no distinctive, diagnostic clinical or
histopathological features which differentiate it from non autoimmune cases, although they tend to have
more severe urticaria.[2]

In our setting, ASST is the only available test for diagnosis of auto immune urticaria. It is simple,
inexpensive, semi-invasive and an easy to perform test which can be done and recorded by the
dermatologist. Since conventional approaches of management are frequently unsuccessful, the ASST is
especially important from the therapeutic point of view, as it can help the dermatologist to commit himself
to initiate immunosuppressive therapies in such patients.

In our study 38% show infective focus on routine screening investigation, CU frequently flared by
intercurrent infection. This is due to non-specific effect of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines or
chemokines, either on mast cells or leading to the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells.
[14] In only 4-35% of such affected patients did cure of infections lead to improvement of urticaria,[15]

On medical and economic grounds it appears prudent to perform comprehensive laboratory diagnostics
only to exclude a particular; individually suspected causative factor and in routine cases, limit the
laboratory work up.

Urticaria followed by non steroidal anti inflammatory drug (NSAID) was observed in four patients and one
patient presented with urticaria followed by intake of oral contraceptives pills. Withdrawal of these
medicines helped to improve of urticaria with in a week. Many drugs can induce urticaria mainly
penicillins, salicylates and NSAIDs by non-immunological mast cell activation with a variety of
substances including neuropeptides, such as substance P.[15] Neuropeptides elicit histamine but not
prostaglandin and leukotriene release. Similarly by inhibiting the cyclo-oxygenase pathway of arachidonic
acid metabolism, diverting it to proinflammatory lipoxygenase pathways products and reducing PGE,
which is inhibitory for immunological mast cell degranulation.[16] Asprin is the most common drug
causing urticaria[16] and accounts for 30-60% of all NSAIDs implicated.[17]

In our study both cholinergic urticaria and dermographism account for 4.7%, which are most common

physical urticaria. This corresponds to the study done by Buss ef al. Cholinergic urticaria occurs due to

stimulation of sweating, whether induced by a rise in core temperature, emotion or gustatory stimuli.[18] It
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2856370/?report=printable 5/18
11/14/2020 ETIOLOGICAL APPROACH TO CHRONIC URTICARIA

is thought to be related to stimulation of cholinergic postganglionic sympathetic nerve supply to sweat
glands, itchy wheals appear within minutes of exertion with small 1-3 mm flares that persist for a few
minutes to an hour. Dermographism is due to triple response consisting of a local erythema due to capillary
vasodilatation, followed by edema and a surrounding flare due to axon reflex induced dilatation of
arterioles. This reaction is normal but in 5% of the normal population this physiological response is
sufficiently exaggerated to warrant a medical consultation.

Cold urticaria was diagnosed in 2%, corresponding to reports in literature of about 1-3%. It is due to
release of histamine, PGD2,[19] leukotrienes, platelet activating factor,[20] TNFa, autoantibodies like IgE
and IgM has been recorded.[21] Delayed pressure urticaria was diagnosed in 2% as in the literature and is
estimated to be between 2-5% and is due to the release of chemo attractant factors with the up-regulation
of vascular adhesion molecules, E-selectin and VCAM 1.[22]

Skin prick test is the most convenient and least expensive method of allergy testing and result can be made
available with in 60 minutes. Prick testing helps to trace out type 1 (immunoglobulin E) mediated
hypersensitivity specifically.[23,24] Patients with idiopathic urticaria, who were willing and had a high
degree of suspicion towards particular food items or aero allergens, an in whom all other clinical and
laboratory findings were non contributory, underwent skin prick testing. Standardized extracts for many
antigens are readily available. These tests are generally well tolerated with mild erythema and edema that
usually subsides within one to two hours. More severe swelling is treated with oral antihistamines, topical
steroids and ice-packs.

A positive skin test indicates that the subject is allergic to the particular substance. Bigger papules usually
indicate a greater degree of sensitivity. The accuracy of skin tests can vary. Patients react differently to the
same test performed at different times or may react positively to an allergen during the test but may not
react to it in everyday life.[25] In general, skin tests are most reliable for diagnosing allergies to airborne
substances, such as pollen, epithelia, and dust mites.

Diagnosing food allergies can be complex, and may need additional tests or procedures. In our study
maximum number of patients reacted positively to brinjal out of the food allergens but due to the small
case numbers for prick test, no conclusion can be made. In pollen, maximum number of patients reacted
positively to parthenium which is the most common aeroallergen in India.

Conclusion

Urticaria affects 15-25% of people at least once in their lifetime. It is a frustrating condition for both
patient and physician. It is more common in the reproductive age group with a female predominance. In
our study, lesions lasted for a significantly longer duration and a higher frequency of attacks in ASST
positive patients. Markers of autoimmunity may be found in many types of chronic urticaria, but ASST is
the only clinically demonstrable evidence of autoimmunity. ASST provides an easy inexpensive
investigation in chronic urticaria and helps direct attention towards the underlying systemic auto immune
diseases. It also provides evidence for the rational use of immunomodulators to modify the course of
chronic urticaria. Exhaustive work ups with extensive laboratory, technical diagnostics, challenge tests and
skin prick testing should be reserved for individual cases following detailed history.
