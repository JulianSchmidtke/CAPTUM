Background: Our knowledge of autoimmune characteristics of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is limited.

Objective: To study the demographic, laboratory, and clinical patterns of a cohort of patients with CIU.

Methods: We evaluated 236 patients with CIU seen in a recent 2-year span. For serum basophil activation testing
(BAT-CD203), the samples were sent to the National Jewish Medical and Research Center for donor basophil CD203 expression
assay (5% cell surface expression was considered a positive result).

Results: Of the 236 patients with CIU, 77% were females with a mean age of 39 years. The mean age of males was 43 years.
Of patients tested for BAT-CD203 (50 females and 8 males), 38% of females (n = 19) and 13% of males (n = 1) had positive
test results. Of the 146 females and 42 males tested for thyroid autoimmunity (TA), 34% of females (n = 50) and 17% of males
(n = 7) had underlying TA. Nine BAT-CD203-positive females (47%) had TA compared with 11 of 30 BAT-CD203-negative
females (37%). No correlation was found between antinuclear antibodies and BAT-CD203. Cyclosporine or corticosteroids were
used in 28% of the study population, with another 16% requiring a trial of additional third-line agents with or without
prednisone/cyclosporine. There was no significant difference in the maximum number of medications used in subgroups based
on the presence or absence of BAT-CD203 and TA.

Conclusions: The frequency of TA in patients with CIU was 30%, which is higher than that previously reported. The
frequency of TA and BAT-CD203 positivity was higher in females. In this clinical cohort, there was no correlation between

BAT-CD203 and TA.

INTRODUCTION

Urticaria is a common dermatologic condition that affects
15% to 25% of the population at some point in life.! Chronic
urticaria (CU) is defined as the occurrence of continuous, or
intermittent, hives for at least 6 weeks. The lesions are
typically edematous pink or red wheals of variable size and
shape, with surrounding erythema, and are generally pruritic.
Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) constitutes 80% to 90% of
patients with CU! and affects up to 0.5% to 5% of the
population at some time in life.2~4 Up to 20% of patients with
CIU can have symptoms for longer than 10 years. CIU is
more common in adults than in children. There is a female to
male ratio as high as 4:1, with the highest incidence in
middle-aged women. Almost 50% of patients with urticaria
present with associated angioedema, whereas 40% have urticaria alone and 10% have isolated angioedema without
urticaria.' It has been reported that CIU is a major affliction

that causes serious disability to a degree equal to that experienced by patients with 3-vessel coronary artery disease.>

Studies in recent years have shown that up to 30% to 50%
of patients with CIU have autoantibodies to the a-chain of the
high-affinity receptor for IgE (FceRIa).° Therefore, a high
proportion of CIU is now thought to be an intrinsic autoimmune condition. It is hypothesized that these IgG autoantibodies react specifically with the FceRla on dermal mast
cells and basophils, evoking release of histamine and other
mediators, which cause urticaria and angioedema, although
conclusive proof of this mechanism in vivo has not yet been
reported. Further evidence to support an autoimmune basis
for urticaria in some patients is the close association with
thyroid autoimmunity (TA).’ Such patients have autoantibodies directed against thyroid proteins but may be euthyroid.
However, there is conflicting evidence that treating the underlying thyroid dysfunction alters the course of the accompanying urticaria.*°

The severity and clinical pattern of CIU can vary considerably from patient to patient, resulting in treatment regimens
that need to be individualized. Antihistamines are the cornerstone of the therapeutic approach. Although short tapering
courses of oral corticosteroids may be reasonable in emergency situations, long-term corticosteroid therapy can have
serious associated adverse effects and is recommended only

This retrospective analysis sought to collect and summarize
the baseline demographic, laboratory, and clinical characteristics in a large cohort of patients with CIU and to review the
various medication groups used to treat the study population.
A particular interest of the study was to evaluate the relationship of CIU to functional autoantibodies against the FeeRla
and the association with TA.

METHODS

Study Design

Patients who met the diagnostic criteria for CIU and who
were evaluated between April 1, 2006, and March 31, 2008,
at the Division of Allergy and Inflammation, Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, were
included in the study, and the clinical records were extensively evaluated retrospectively.

Patient Selection

Individuals were included in this study if they had CIU, ie,
episodes of hives (characteristic wheal and flare of <24—48
hours’ duration), occurring at least 3 times a week for at least
6 weeks without an identifiable exogenous cause. Other
forms of CU, such as physical, drug-induced, cholinergic, and
acute urticaria, were excluded. Systemic disease and dermatologic disease that could have interfered with evaluation of
the symptoms (such as erythema multiforme, bullous pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis, mastocytosis/urticaria pigmentosa, pruritic urticarial papules, and plaques of pregnancy) were also criteria for exclusion. Patients with a
possible infectious cause of their urticaria (such as Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B and C, Epstein-Barr virus, and
herpes) were also excluded. Patients with documented vasculitis on skin biopsy specimens were excluded, but some
patients with features of vasculitis but not meeting the full
pathologic criteria for vasculitis were included (n = 4). A
detailed review of the clinical records of more than 500
patients seen for urticaria was performed, resulting in the
selection of 236 study participants based on the inclusion
criteria. The study protocol had the full approval of the
institutional review board of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center.

Methods

Clinical and laboratory data pertaining to baseline characteristics, treatment modalities used, and treatment responses
were collected via medical record review, were entered into a
database program (Microsoft Excel 2003; Microsoft Corp,
Redmond, Washington), and were compiled for analysis.
Collection of data from the clinical evaluation focused particular attention on the severity and distribution of body areas
affected by CIU, along with associated conditions, such as
angioedema and dermographism. Collection of data from the
laboratory evaluation included a review of all tests performed

as part of the urticaria workup. These tests generally included
a complete blood cell count with a differential count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, antithyroid peroxidase antibodies,
antithyroglobulin antibodies, and thyrotropin, at a minimum.
Results of the autologous serum skin test (ASST) and the
basophil activation test (BAT-CD203) were also included in
the analysis. For BAT-CD203, the samples from patients seen
during this period were sent to the Clinical Reference Laboratories at National Jewish Medical and Research Center,
Denver, Colorado, where measurement of donor basophil
CD203 expression was used as a basophil activation marker,
and more than 5% cell surface expression was reported as
positive! (test name “anti-FceR1 antibody”; test code IGERAB). Because of the retrospective nature of the study,
certain laboratory tests were not available for all patients.

A detailed analysis of all the agents used for treatment was
performed, which included determination of the various
groups of the administered medications, the average number
of medications from all the various groups used in the study
cohort, and the maximum number of medications from various groups used simultaneously. Various correlations of the
treatment patterns among subgroups of patients based on
demographic distributions and duration of disease activity
were also performed. Nonparametric comparisons of group
means were made using the Mann-Whitney test. Proportions
were compared using the x” test. P < .05 was considered
significant for all tests.

RESULTS

Baseline Characteristics

Of the 236 patients with CIU, 181 were females (77%) and 55
were males (23%) (Table 1). The mean patient age at the time
of evaluation was 39 years (range, 16—87 years) for females
and 43 years (range, 19-78 years) for males. The mean
duration of symptoms before evaluation was 35.6 months
(range, 0.25-552 months) in females and 30.8 months (range,
0.25-216 months) in males. Eighty-three of the 236 patients
(35%) exhibited angioedema along with urticaria, which was
less than expected.' Sixty-one females (73%) and 22 males
(27%) had associated angioedema, which was proportional to
the overall sex distribution. Associated dermographism was
present in 58 patients (25%), of which 41 were females (71%)
and 17 were males (29%), also in correlation with the overall
sex distribution. Thirty-seven of 211 patients (18%) who
were tested for erythrocyte sedimentation rate had a raised

similar distribution in the group with only urticaria (18%) and
in the group with urticaria along with associated angioedema
(16%).

Frequency of Autoantibodies

The gold standard for detecting autoantibodies to the FeeRIa
in CIU is the functional in vitro donor basophil histaminereleasing activity (HRA) assay.'*!° BAT-CD203 (measuring
CD203 expression) was used as a marker to identify autoantibodies to the FeeRIa considering the reasonable correlation
of BAT-CD203 with HRA cited in the literature (r = 0.6;
P = .001; sensitivity = 77%; specificity = 82%; positive
predictive value = 83%; and negative predictive value =
75%).'* BAT-CD203 was measured in 58 of the 236 patients
using an assay offered by a commercial laboratory (see the
“Methods” section), and the results were found to be positive
in 20 patients (34%) (Table 2). Of the 50 female and 8 male
patients tested for BAT-CD203, a larger proportion of females demonstrated evidence of autoimmunity, with 38% of
females (n = 19) and 13% of males (n = 1) showing a
positive result. TA was tested in 146 females and 42 males
and was defined by the presence of elevated levels of either
or both anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (>35 IU/mL) and
antithyroglobulin antibodies (>40 IU/mL). TA was found to
be present in 34% of females (n = 50) and in 17% of males
(n = 7). Because the number expected by chance alone was
11, given that less than 6% of healthy individuals have TA,
the association proves significant for males and females (P <
.01). Evidence of TA was present in 47% of BAT-CD203positive females (n = 9), and there was no evidence of TA in
the 1 BAT-CD203-positive male tested. Conversely, 37% of
BAT-CD203-negative females (n = 11) and 14% of BATCD203-negative males (n = 1) had TA. There was no
statistically significant correlation between the presence of
TA and evidence of basophil activation in patients tested for
TA and BAT-CD203.

Owing to the availability of in vitro assays in the past 2
years, ASST was less frequently performed than it was previously, particularly owing to the technical challenges of
performing skin testing in patients with CU, including the
confounding nature of concomitant dermographism and the

need to stop antihistamine treatment to obtain reliable skin
test results. Therefore, only 8 patients, 7 females and | male,
underwent ASST. Four of the 7 females had positive test
results (57%), whereas the only male patient who underwent
ASST showed a negative result. Correlations among ASST,
BAT-CD203, and TA results are given in Table 3. The small
number of patients who underwent ASST renders the results
insufficient to draw any meaningful conclusions.

Serum IgE level was measured in 105 of the 236 patients
and was found to be elevated (=200 kU/L) in 25 (24%). Four
of 10 patients (40%) with an elevated IgE level showed a
positive BAT-CD203 result, whereas 13 of 34 patients (38%)
with a normal IgE level showed a positive BAT-CD203
finding (Table 4). The results, therefore, seem to show no
correlation between BAT-CD203 results and IgE level. Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) were tested in 69 patients (57
females and 12 males). A positive result was found in 22
patients (32% of females and 33% of males). A detailed
description of all the ANA-positive patients according to the
titer measurement and the presence of basophil activation or
TA is given in Table 5. No correlations were found between
ANA and BAT-CD203 or between ANA and TA (Table 5).

Treatment Analysis

The wide range of disease severity in this patient population
resulted in a variety of treatment regimens. However, antihistamines remained the mainstay of treatment, with the
addition of prednisone and other agents when a more aggressive approach was required to control the symptoms (Table
6). H, antagonist monotherapy was used and continued in 83
of 225 patients (37%). Second-generation H, antagonists,
which are long acting and minimally sedating, were generally
used as first-line agents, with the first-generation H, antagonists added only if the disease was not controlled with use of
the second-generation H, antagonists or H, antagonists. Combined H, and H, antagonists were administered to 80 of 225
patients (36%).

Patients with CIU who had not responded to H, antagonists
(even in high doses), either alone or combined with H,
antagonists, used corticosteroids or cyclosporine. Prednisone/
cyclosporine was used in addition to H, antagonists in 23 of
225 patients (10%) and in addition to H, + H, antagonists in

39 of 225 patients (17%). Prednisone or cyclosporine was
used in 28% of patients. Additional third-line agents were
administered in patients with severe CIU who were nonresponsive to the previously mentioned medications. Such
third-line pharmacotherapy options were used with or without
prednisone/cyclosporine in 37 of 225 patients (16%). These
agents mainly included thyroxine and leukotriene receptor
antagonists, with rare use of agents such as intravenous
gamma globulin, mycophenolate, colchicine, and hydroxychloroquine.

Additional pharmacotherapy agents tended to be added in
a step-up manner as needed to control the disease. Thus, the
treatment regimens ranged from H, antagonist monotherapy
to therapy with multiple agents, including prednisone, cyclosporine, and other third-line agents. The maximum number of
agents administered to a patient to control disease symptoms
at any time during treatment was recorded. The control of
disease symptoms was determined clinically and resulted in
stepping up (increasing doses to published maximums or
adding another agent) or stepping down (decreasing doses or
discontinuing use of an agent) medical therapy. The maximum number of agents used ranged from | to 7, with a mean
of 2.6 for 225 patients. Patients with urticaria alone required
an average of 2.4 agents, whereas patients with associated
angioedema required 2.9 agents (P < .01).

Analysis was also performed for the number of agents used
in subgroups of patients based on the duration of symptoms
(Table 7). There seemed to be no correlation between duration of symptoms and the maximum number of medications
used or between duration of symptoms and use of prednisone/
cyclosporine.

The maximum number of medications used and the use of
prednisone/cyclosporine were also studied in subgroups
based on the presence or absence of basophil activation and
TA. The results showed a trend toward more medications
used in the BAT-CD203- and TA-positive subgroups (BATCD203 positive = 3.7, BAT-CD203 negative = 3.2; TA
positive = 2.8, and TA negative = 2.6) and a similar greater
use of prednisone/cyclosporine (BAT-CD203 positive =
60% of patients, BAT-CD203 negative = 58%; TA positive = 40%, and TA negative = 28%); however, the differences were not statistically significant. Use of multiple agents
in subgroups based on patient age was also studied (Table 8).

 

The data suggest that more agents were used to control CIU
in patients older than 55 years compared with the other age
groups (P < .01).

DISCUSSION

This study shows a 30% frequency of TA in patients with
CIU, which is higher than that previously reported. In early
studies,’ the frequency of TA in patients with CIU is 12% to
20%, but some recent studies'”'* showed a frequency as high
as 20% to 30%. The frequency of TA was seen to be higher
in females (34% in females compared with 17% in males).
This is in accord with findings of a higher prevalence of TA
in women in cross-sectional studies.!? Other investigators??
have also shown that the association of CIU with TA is higher
in females. The mechanism whereby TA is associated with
CIU is poorly understood. The presence of elevated antithyroid antibody levels may not be directly involved in the mast
cell degranulation and pathogenesis of CIU but may serve
only as a marker of autoimmunity.

The present study shows that approximately 34% of patients with CIU and available results exhibit autoantibodies to
the FceRla (as identified using BAT-CD203), and the frequency was found to be higher in females. This finding
corresponds to the considerable evidence that up to 30% to
50% of patients with CIU have autoantibodies to the
FceRIa.® In approximately 5% of patients with CIU demonstrating autoimmunity by means of ASST, there is no evidence of autoantibody to the FeeRIa, and in these cases, it is
thought that the serum may contain autoantibodies to the IgE
molecule itself.° However, there is currently no commercially
available assay for these anti-IgE antibodies.

Results of previous studies! have suggested that there is a
close association between TA (or abnormal thyroid function)
and HRA. We used donor basophil CD203 expression as a
marker to identify autoantibodies to the FeeRla considering
its reasonable correlation with HRA (r = 0.6; P = .001;
sensitivity = 77%; specificity = 82%; positive predictive
value = 83%; and negative predictive value = 75%)'*; however, we found no significant correlation between CD203
upregulation and TA in patients tested for both. No previous
data are available for the correlation between CD203 upregulation and TA in patients with CIU. However, some other
recent studies” have also failed to show a strong relationship
between HRA and TA. We also found no relationship between ANAs and BAT-CD203.

The associations of angioedema and dermographism with
CIU have been documented to be 50% for each condition.'3
The present study showed a lower rate of association, with
angioedema being present in 35% of the study population
(n = 83) and dermographism in approximately 25% (n = 58).

Cyclosporine or corticosteroids were used in 28% of the
study population, with another 16% requiring a trial of additional agents (such as thyroxine, intravenous gamma globulin, colchicine, antileukotrienes, hydroxychloroquine, and
mycophenolate) used with or without prednisone/cyclosporine. This shows that in more than a quarter of the patients

with CIU, adequate control of disease symptoms is not
achieved with antihistamine therapy alone and that additional
pharmacotherapy options need to be used. We did not have
sufficient data available to evaluate the efficacy of each
particular agent.

The present data demonstrate that prednisone/cyclosporine
was more likely to be used in the first 6 months or after 5

years of disease duration (approximately 29%-30% of patients each). The present study also reveals that significantly
more therapeutic agents were used in older patients (=55
years) compared with younger age groups. However, the
retrospective nature of this analysis makes it difficult to draw
meaningful conclusions.

TA or the presence of autoantibodies to the FceRla (as
measured using a reasonably representative assay) is often
considered to be evidence of an autoimmune cause of CIU,
and these cases are often considered to be more difficult to
control.*4?5 However, the present study found that patients
with TA or CD203 upregulation did not require significantly
more agents to control their symptoms than did patients
without TA or CD203 upregulation. The exact role of autoantibodies to the FceRIa or IgE in the pathogenesis of CIU
has not yet been fully elucidated. It is still possible that TA
and HRA are epiphenomena associated with CIU but that
they are not directly involved in the pathogenesis of the
disease.

Although the present study has limitations owing to its
retrospective design (with missing data points for some patients) and its potential for selection bias in what tests were
performed in which patients (because there were no prospective protocols for the use of diagnostic tests such as BATCD203, antithyroid peroxidase/antithyroglobulin antibodies,
and ASST), it provides insight into the demographic distribution, clinical presentation, pertinent laboratory findings,
and pattern of treatment options used to control CIU. Furthermore, this study highlights the need for a large-scale,
prospective study of patients with CU to fully evaluate the
correlations between positive test values and responders to
individual therapies, which may help develop detailed treatment algorithms for this disorder.
