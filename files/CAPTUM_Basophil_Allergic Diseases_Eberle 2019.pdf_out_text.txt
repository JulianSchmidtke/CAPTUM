The mechanisms leading to allergic skin inflammation, such as atopic dermatitis or urticaria, are poorly defined.
Here we used a mouse model for IgE-dependent chronic allergic inflammation to study the role of basophils
and eosinophils for induction of pathology. FceRI expression in basophils was required for the ear swelling
response, and basophils promoted the expression of eosinophil-recruiting chemokines in the ear. The ear
swelling response could be prevented by prior infection of mice with helminths in an IgE-dependent manner.
Impaired skin eosinophilia and reduced ear swelling was further observed in IL-4/IL-13—deficient and STAT6deficient mice. In addition, eosinophil-deficient AdbIGATA mice showed only weak ear swelling response,
which could be enhanced by eosinophil transfer. This suggests that IgE-activated basophils orchestrate the
recruitment of eosinophils by secretion of IL-4/IL-13, which leads to STAT6-dependent expression of CCL24
from endothelial cells and extravasation of eosinophils into the ear pinna. Eosinophils are then the critical
effector cells that cause pathology. Therefore, combined therapeutic approaches that block basophil activation
and reduce eosinophil numbers could be efficient strategies to improve treatment of chronic allergic disorders
of the skin.

Role of Eosinophils and Basophils in IgE-CAI

STAT6-deficient (STAT6ko) and mice, suggesting that eosinophils are the critical terminal effector cells in this model.
Indeed, eosinophil-deficient AdbIGATA mice showed only
weak ear swelling, which could be restored by adoptively
transferred eosinophils. These results indicate that IgEactivated basophils elicit the terminal effector phase by
orchestrating recruitment of eosinophils, which then cause
pathology in the skin.

RESULTS

Expression of activating Fc receptors and IL-4/IL-13 by
basophils is required for IgE-CAI

Previous studies have demonstrated a critical role for basophils in IgE-mediated chronic allergic skin inflammation at
the late phase (day 2—3 after challenge) (Mukai et al., 2005;
Ohnmacht et al., 2010). However, it remained unclear
whether basophils have to be directly activated by IgE and
whether basophils are required for causing vascular leakage
in the skin. To address these points, we injected Mcpt8Cre
and wild-type (WT) mice with IgE anti-trinitrophenyl (TNP)
intravenously, followed by intradermal injection of TNP-OVA
into the ear pinnae on the next day. The ear thickness was
measured every day and we observed a prominent ear
swelling response in WT mice, peaking on day 2 after challenge and going back to normal at day 5—6, whereas no
swelling was detected in basophil-deficient Mcpt8Cre mice
(Figure 1a). By intravenous injection of Evans Blue at 20
minutes before harvesting the ears on day 2 after TNP-OVA
challenge, we could visualize and quantify the leakage of
blood vessels at the site of inflammation of WT mice, while
no vascular leakage was found in Mcpt8Cre mice (Figure 1b).

To further investigate whether the ear swelling response
requires direct binding and cross-linking of IgE anti-TNP on
the cell surface of basophils, we created mixed bone marrow
(BM) chimeras lacking FcRy on basophils by mixing
Mcpt8Cre BM with FcRyko BM in a 4:1 ratio. As control WT
BM was used instead of FcRyko BM. Like in the complete
absence of basophils, mice lacking FcRy on basophils show
an impaired ear swelling response when compared to BasoWT chimeras (Figure 1c).

This indicates that basophils have to be directly activated
by the high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) to elicit the ear
swelling response. We further investigated the role of IL-4/IL13 from basophils for the ear swelling response by generating
mixed BM chimeras with BM from Mcpt8Cre mice and 413ko mice mixed in a 4:1 ratio. Mice lacking IL-4/IL-13
expression by basophils developed a significantly reduced
ear swelling response compared to control mice (Figure 1d).

 

 

Helminth-elicited IgE ameliorates IgE-CAI
Based on the observation that basophils have to be directly
activated by IgE anti-TNP bound to FceRI, we next investigated whether high levels of polyclonal IgE can saturate
FceRI receptors and thereby prevent basophil activation in
this model. To address this point, we infected mice with the
gastrointestinal helminths Nippostrongylus brasiliensis or
Heligmosomoides polygyrus. Thirteen days later, serum IgE
levels were measured by ELISA and IgE anti-TNP was
injected into the infected mice or naive mice as controls,
followed by intradermal injection of TNP-OVA into the ear
on the next day. Helminth-infected mice showed high serum

IgE levels and were protected from the ear swelling response
compared to uninfected control mice (Figure 2a, 2b). The
protective role of helminth-elicited IgE in IgE-CAl was
further confirmed by analysis of N. brasiliensis—infected
IgE-deficient mice, which developed a normal ear swelling
response (Figure 2c). By staining of basophils with fluorescently labeled IgE anti-TNP antibody, we could demonstrate that binding of this antibody to the surface of
basophils isolated from helminth-infected mice was
impaired (Figure 2d). Therefore, we can conclude that helminth infection leads to saturation of the FceRI on basophils
and thereby prevents their sensitization with the administered IgE anti-TNP antibody.

 

 

Basophils enhance expression of TSLP, CCL3, and CCL24 in
the ear pinna
To further investigate the mechanisms by which activated
basophils orchestrate the ear swelling response, we analyzed
basophil-dependent expression of chemokines, TSLP, and
VCAM-1 in the ear pinna by quantitative reverse transcriptase
PCR on day 2 after TNP-OVA challenge. No changes were
detected for CCL5 (RANTES), CCL11 (eotaxin-1), and VCAM1 expression, but expression levels of TSLP, CCL24 (eotaxin2), and CCL3 (MIP-1a) were significantly lower in the
absence of basophils compared to WT mice (Figure 3a).

We further determined the CCL24 protein level in the ear
pinna by ELISA and observed significantly reduced levels in
Mcpt8Cre compared to WT mice (Figure 3b). This result
suggests that basophils promote the recruitment of other
effector cells that could contribute to the ear swelling
response.

 

IL-4/IL-13 and STAT6 signaling promotes ear swelling and
effector cell recruitment during IgE-CAI

Basophils are an important source of IL-4 and IL-13, which
signal through STAT6 and induce expression of chemokines
and adhesion molecules in endothelial cells. To investigate
the role of IL-4/IL-13 and STAT6 for the ear swelling response
and recruitment of effector cells, we studied the IgE-CAl
response in 4-13ko and STAT6ko mice. Ear swelling was
significantly decreased in 4-13ko and STAT6ko mice
(Figure 4a, 4b). Furthermore, to study the gene expression
and recruitment of innate effector cells into the ear pinna,
reverse transcriptase PCR and flow cytometric analysis of WT,
4-13ko, and STAT6ko ears was performed on day 2 after TNPOVA challenge. We observed no significant increase of M2
macrophage marker in WT compared to 4-13ko and STAT6ko
mice at this early time point (Supplementary Figure $1 online). We further revealed a trend toward higher CCL24 and
TSLP levels in WT compared to 4-13ko and STAT6ko mice
(Supplementary Figure $1). No difference in percentages and
total numbers of neutrophils and basophils was detected in
the ears of WT, 4-13ko, and STAT6ko mice. However, percentage and also total numbers of eosinophils in the ears
were significantly reduced in both knockout strains
compared to WT mice (Figure 4c—4g).

reduced numbers of eosinophils in the ear pinna, we hypothesized that eosinophils could play an important role in
this model of skin inflammation. To prove this hypothesis,
we analyzed eosinophil-deficient AdbIGATA mice and
observed that in the absence of eosinophils, no ear swelling
was elicited while adoptive transfer of BM-derived eosinophils was sufficient to promote the ear swelling response in
AdbIGATA mice (Figure 5a). This effect could not be
explained by reduced basophil numbers or impaired basophil function in AdbIGATA mice (Supplementary Figure S2
online). The eosinophil cultures contained negligible
numbers of basophils so that the transfer did not artificially
increase the number of basophils (Supplementary Figure $3
online). On the other hand, Mcpt8Cre mice showed no
defect in generation of eosinophils (Supplementary
Figure $2).
To visualize the distribution and accumulation of eosinophils in the ear parenchyma, two-photon imaging of
unfixed ear of EpxCre_R26""™*° mice was performed on
day 2 after challenge and compared to untreated EpxCre_R26'47™="'© mice. Prominent extravascular accumulation of eosinophils was apparent in the ear of challenged
mice, while only few eosinophils were found in the ear of
untreated control mice (Figure 5b). Next, we addressed
the activation status of recruited eosinophils in the ear in
comparison to eosinophils in the peripheral blood by flow
cytometry. We used IL-4eGFP reporter mice (4get mice) to
facilitate the gating of eosinophils as IL-4eGFP*SSC™ cells
with a parental gate on live CD45" cells. The samples
were stained for CD62L and Siglec-F to differentiate between resting (Siglec-F'° CD62L") and activated (Siglec-F™
CD62L") eosinophils. As expected, recruited eosinophils
in the ear showed an activated phenotype, while blood
eosinophils were not activated (Figure 5c). Finally, we
performed adoptive transfers of eosinophils into
AdbIGATA mice and analyzed the role of G-protein—coupled chemotactic receptors on eosinophils for
recruitment to the ear pinna. Therefore, we transferred
1.5 x 107 eosinophils that had either been treated with
pertussis toxin to inhibit G-protein—coupled chemotactic
receptors or were left untreated. Right after the eosinophi
transfer, mice were subjected to the IgE-CAI model. Efficient recruitment of eosinophils was observed after transfer of untreated eosinophils into TNP-OVA challenged
mice, which could be inhibited by prior pertussis toxin
treatment (Figure 5d).
Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that eosinophils are recruited to the ear pinna, acquire an activated
phenotype, and promote the ear swelling response. Therefore, a two-step model is likely to operate in this setting,
where basophils get first activated by cross-linking of IgE on

CCL24 and probably other chemoattractants in endothelial
cells to recruit eosinophils that finally cause pathology in the
skin (Figure 6).

DISCUSSION

Basophils are indispensable for IgE-CAI in the ear skin, as we
demonstrate by comparing ear swelling and dye extravasation in WT and basophil-deficient Mcpt8Cre mice and
thereby largely confirm previous studies (Cheng et al., 2015;
Mukai et al., 2005; Ohnmacht et al., 2010). It was previously
shown that mice deficient for the signal transducing subunit
FcRy of the FceRI develop no IgE-CAI and reconstitution of
irradiated FcRy-deficient mice with total or basophilenriched BM from WT mice was sufficient to restore the
response (Mukai et al., 2005). By generating mixed BM chimeras, we could now demonstrate that FCRY expression on
basophils is required for IgE-CAI. We previously observed a
similar importance for activation of basophils via this receptor during secondary helminth infections, where only
mice with FceRlI-expressing basophils were able to clear
worms efficiently (Schwartz et al., 2014).

Interestingly, not only the lack of FceRI on basophils
protects against pathology in the IgE-CAI model, but also
high levels of helminth-elicited IgE. We observed the
ameliorated ear swelling response in two different gastrointestinal helminth infection models. A protective effect was

only observed in WT but not in IgE-deficient mice, which
demonstrates that indeed helminth-induced IgE rather than
other helminth-elicited suppressive cell types or factors are
accountable for the effect. The IgE saturation hypothesis
suggests that high levels of helminth-elicited polyclonal IgE
saturates the high-affinity receptor for IgE (FceRI) on mast
cells and basophils and prevents binding of allergenspecific IgE (Godfrey and Gradidge, 1976; Stanworth
et al., 1967). Here we used a mouse infection model to
provide further experimental evidence that helminthelicited IgE does saturate the available FceRI on the surface of basophils so that the sensitizing IgE anti-TNP antibody cannot bind. However other studies could not confirm
a blocking effect by helminth-elicited IgE (Flohr et al.,
2009). They rather indicate that helminth-induced suppression of allergy is caused by increased numbers of regulatory T cells, IL-10—producing T cells, and alternatively
activated macrophages (Flohr et al., 2009; Wilson et al.,
2005). Possible explanations for the apparent discrepancies between different studies include the experimental
protocols (active vs Passive sensitization), investigated organs (skin, lung, vascular system), and differences in serum
evels of IgE. With regard to the human population, the low
incidence of allergic inflammation in countries with poor
sanitary conditions and high prevalence of helminth infections suggests that helminths can protect against allergy,
supporting the hygiene hypothesis (Wills-Karp et al., 2001).

A large cohort study demonstrated that de-worming leads to
increased incidence of skin prick test positivity against
house dust mite allergens (van den Biggelaar et al., 2004).
Several other studies have confirmed the effect, but the
mechanism of protection remains poorly defined (Flohr
et al., 2009).

IgE-mediated basophil activation in the skin causes
release of lipid mediators, cytokines, chemokines, and
histamine, which can directly or indirectly result in pathology. Moreover, recent studies could show that the
release of basophil-specific proteases, like mMCP-8 and
mMCP-11, increases microvascular permeability in an
activity-dependent manner to induce allergic inflammation
(Iki et al., 2016; Tsutsui et al., 2017). Acting on tissueresident cells, like fibroblasts and endothelial cells, we
found that basophils enhance expression of TSLP, CCL3,
and CCL24 (eotaxin-2) in the ear pinna. We have previously
shown that TSLP is required for the ear swelling response
elicited by topical application of the vitamin D analogon
MC903 to the ear skin (Schwartz et al., 2016). However, we
observed no difference in the IgE-CAI ear swelling response
when comparing TSLP-deficient to WT mice, indicating that
TSLP is not a major pro-inflammatory factor in this model
(data not shown). A recent study demonstrated basophildependent upregulation of VCAM-1 in a similar model of
ear skin inflammation induced by topical application of
DNEFB in anti-DNP IgE-sensitized mice (Cheng et al., 2015).
Consistent with this report, we observed massive recruitment of eosinophils into the ear pinna, and although
VCAM-1 expression was not induced in the IgE-CAI model,
eosinophil recruitment could be explained by induction of
CCL24 expression in a basophil-dependent manner. The
chemokine CCL24 binds to CCR3, which is highly

expressed on resting eosinophils and promotes transendothelial migration (Shahabuddin et al., 2000). CCL24 is
further known to be regulated by STAT6, which gets activated in response to IL-4 and IL-13 signaling (Neilsen and
Bryce, 2010; Walker et al., 2009; Zimmermann et al.,
2000). Because basophils are a major source for IL-4 and
IL-13, they probably directly induce expression of CCL24 in
endothelial cells of the ear. Our results demonstrate an
important role of basophil-derived IL-4/IL-13 and expression of STAT6-regulated genes for eosinophil recruitment
and the ear swelling response in the IgE-CAI model. Interestingly, basophil and neutrophil recruitment was not
affected by the lack of IL-4/IL-13 or STAT6. Despite the
profound reduction in eosinophil recruitment, the ear
swelling was only partially reduced in STAT6ko and 4-13ko
mice, indicating that even low numbers of eosinophils can
be sufficient to elicit a weak skin inflammation. Interestingly, others have shown that STAT6 can also dampen
the inflammatory skin response to repeated TNP-OVA
challenge at later phases of the response, probably by induction of M2-polarized anti-inflammatory macrophages
(Hashimoto et al., 2015).

Further analysis of eosinophil-deficient AdbIGATA mice
revealed a critical role for eosinophils in addition to basophils for induction of the ear swelling response in IgE-CAI. In
contrast to blood eosinophils, the recruited eosinophils in the
skin had an activated phenotype with high expression levels
of Siglec-F and downregulation of CD62L, as we previously
defined in a helminth infection model (Voehringer et al.,
2007). Recently, this subset has been further characterized
and termed inflammatory eosinophils in a murine model of
allergic asthma (Mesnil et al., 2016). In the IgE-CAI model,
it is likely that circulating eosinophils get recruited
via CCL24 and other chemoattractants that signal via
G-protein—coupled chemotactic receptors, because the
ear swelling response could be reconstituted in AdbIGATA
mice by transfer of untreated BM-derived eosinophils
and pretreatment with pertussis toxin, which blocks
G-protein—coupled chemotactic receptor signaling, resulting
in an ameliorated response.

In conclusion, we demonstrate that allergic skin inflammation in the IgE-CAl model requires both basophils and
eosinophils. Basophils first get activated by crosslinking of IgE
bound to FceRI, and this response can be blocked by saturating levels of unspecific serum IgE elicited by helminth
infections. Basophil-derived IL-4/IL-13 then promotes CCL24
expression to induce recruitment of eosinophils, which are
required for downstream execution of the ear swelling
response by release of pro-inflammatory mediators. Based on
these observations, the role of basophils and eosinophils in
human allergic skin diseases should be further investigated,
and combined therapeutic interventions that inhibit basophil
activation and lower eosinophil levels in the skin might be a
promising approach in the future.

mixed BM chimeras, respectively. Mice were kept with antibioticscontaining drinking water (2 g/L neomycin sulfate, 100 mg/L polymyxin B sulfate; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) for 8 weeks after
reconstitution.

Adoptive transfer of eosinophils
Eosinophils were generated from BM as described previously (Dyer
et al., 2008) or isolated from IL-5 transgenic mice (Lee et al., 1997).
To block signaling of G-protein—coupled receptors mature eosinophils where incubated with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin (Calbiochem at
Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) for 2 hours at 37°C, washed
with phosphate buffered saline and 1.5 x 10” of pertussis toxin
treated or untreated cells were transferred intravenously into
AdbIGATA mice simultaneously with starting the IgE-CAl model.

 

IgE-CAI experiments

Mice were injected via the tail vein with 33 fg monoclonal IgE—anti-TNP antibody (clone IgElb4) and challenged the next day via
intradermal injection of 10 [ig TNP;2-coupled OVA (TNP;2-OVA;
LGC Biosearch Technologies, Petaluma, CA) in 10 ul phosphate
buffered saline into the ear pinna. Ear thickness was measured daily
with a digital thickness gauge and the change in percentage
compared to the thickness on day 0 was calculated.

In some experiments, 1 mg Evans blue (Sigma-Aldrich) was
injected intravenously in 200 ul phosphate buffered saline on day 2
after challenge and mice were analyzed 20 minutes later. Vascular
leakage was measured after dye extraction from ear pinnae with
formamide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24—48 hours at 55°C. Light absorption was measured at 620 nm using a Multiskan FC Microplate
Photometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).

Helminth infections

Third-stage larvae of N. brasiliensis were washed extensively in
sterile 0.9% saline at 37°C and 500 third-stage larvae were injected
subcutaneously into mice. Mice were provided antibiotics containing water (2 g/l neomycin sulfate, 100 mg/l polymyxin B sulfate) for
the first 5 days after infection. For the Heligmosomoides polygyrus
bakeri infection model, 200 third-stage larvae were administered by
oral gavage. Thirteen days later, mice were subjected to IgE-CAI, as
described.

ELISA

IgE concentrations were determined by conventional ELISA procedure using anti-lgE clone R35-72 for coating and biotinylated antiIgE clone R35-118 (both from BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA) for
detection, followed by streptavidin-coupled alkaline phosphatase

Figure 6. Model for basophil-elicited and eosinophil-dependent IgE-mediated chronic allergic skin inflammation. (a) In the absence of helminth infection,
FceRI on basophils is not saturated and can bind injected hapten-specific IgE. Antigen-induced IgE cross-linking then activates basophils to release IL-4/IL-13,
which leads to induction of CCL24 expression in endothelial cells. This results in recruitment of eosinophils, which are required for induction of the ear swelling
response. (b) Prior infection with helminths leads to high serum IgE levels, resulting in saturation of FceRI on basophils so that subsequent injection of haptenspecific IgE will not lead to sensitization of basophils and therefore inhibits the ear swelling response. TNP, trinitrophenyl.

(SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL) and para-nitrophenyl substrate
(Sigma-Aldrich). Absorbance at 405 nm was determined using a
Multiskan FC Microplate Photometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). For
CCL24 ELISA, ears were homogenized in RIPA buffer with protease
inhibitors (Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail; Roche, Basel,
Switzerland) with the gentleMACS Octo Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and suspensions analyzed according to manufacturer's instructions (Mouse Eotaxin-2 ELISA Kit
[ab206985]; Abcam, Cambridge, MA).

Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR

RNA of total ear pinnae 2 days after TNP-OVA challenge of IgE-antiTNP-sensitized mice was extracted using TRIsure (Bioline, Luckenwalde, Germany) and gentleMACS Octo Dissociator (Miltenyi
Biotec) according to manufacturer's protocol. Quantitative reverse
transcriptase PCR was performed with primers

Antibodies, cell preparation, and flow cytometry

Single-cell suspension of total ear pinnae was prepared using the
Multi Tissue Dissociation Kit | (Miltenyi Biotec) and gentleMACS
Octo Dissociator with heaters (Miltenyi Biotec) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Single-cell suspensions from spleen were prepared with 100-m cell strainers before an erythrocyte lysis was
performed. Cell suspensions were stained with diluted antibody
mixtures on ice. Antibodies against the following antigens were
used: APC anti-mouse CD49b (HMa2; Biolegend, San Diego, CA),
PE-Cy7 anti-mouse FceRla (MAR-1; eBioscience at Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA), BV421 anti-mouse Siglec-F (E50-2440;
BD Pharmingen at Thermo Fisher Scientific), PerCP-Cy5.5 antimouse CD45 (30-F11; BD Pharmingen), APC/Cy7 anti-mouse Ly-6G

A647, and purified rat-anti-mouse CD16/32 (2.4G2; Bioxcell,
West Lebanon, NH). To exclude dead cells, fixable ViaDye eFluor
506 (eBioscience) was used. Cell populations in ear tissue and blood
on day 2 after TNP-OVA were defined as follows: basophils
(CD49b*IgE*) gated on live CD45" cells, eosinophils (SiglecF*ssch') and neutrophils (Ly6G") gated on live CD45" cells. Flow
cytometry data acquisition was performed on a MACSQuant (Miltenyi Biotec) or BD LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences) instrument. Files
were analyzed with FlowJo software (TreeStar Ashland, OR).

Two-photon microscopy

Two-photon microscopy of unfixed ear pinnae of EpxCre_R26'™"°
mice was performed on day 2 after challenge and compared to
untreated EpxCre_R26'10ma"e mice using a Zeiss LSM880 NLO
Intravital Microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Acquired
data were analyzed with ZEN (blue edition) 2.5 software (Carl Zeiss).

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed with SigmaPlot 12.3 (Systat Software, San Jose, CA) or PRISM 5.02 (GraphPad, La Jolla CA). For ear
swelling curves, data points at each time point were directly
compared between groups of indicated experimental and control
mice if not stated differently in figure legends.
