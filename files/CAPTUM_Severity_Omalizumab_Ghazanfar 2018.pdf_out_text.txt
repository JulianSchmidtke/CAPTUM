Abstract

Aim: To examine the effectiveness of omalizumab (anti-lgE) on symptoms and disease-related
quality of life in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), and to identify possible patient specific factors

associated with response to omalizumab in patients with antihistamine refractory CSU.

Methods: Six months prospective trial of omalizumab 300 mg every four weeks among patients with
CSU from a dermatological university department. The primary outcome was the urticaria activity

score in the past week (UAS7) at three months.

Results: A total of 117 patients (39 men and 78 women) with a mean age of 42 years were included.
The mean baseline UAS7 score was 29.3 points (SD=10.8), which improved to 11.9 points (SD=12.9)
at three months follow up, difference=17.4 points (95% Cl: 14.8-19.9), p<0.0001. Other patientreported outcomes (PROs) also improved significantly during three months of treatment. No
significant further improvement was seen between three and six months follow up. None of the
following patient specific factors: sex, age, age of onset of CSU, symptom duration, presence of
chronic inducible urticaria (CINDU), comorbidities, positive urticaria HR test, smoking, ethnicity,
angioedema, serum total IgE level, CRP, leukocytes, absolute neutrophil count or previous treatment
with prednisolone or montelukast were significantly associated with response to omalizumab at
three months, p>0.05 for all comparisons. Previous treatment with traditional immunosuppressant
drugs (azathioprine, cyclosporine or methotrexate) was associated with poorer treatment response
to omalizumab at three months, p<0.001. A strong correlation was seen between different patient
reported outcomes (PROs) at baseline and three months follow up. Fifteen patients (12.8%) reported

side effects of the treatment.

Conclusion: Omalizumab is a highly effective therapy for antihistamine refractory CSU with
treatment effects similar to those observed in randomized controlled trials. Validated PROs to assess
disease activity, disease control and impairment of quality of life are valuable tools in the clinical
management of CSU. Identification of patient specific predictors of effect and safety of omalizumab

in CSU is still warranted.

Introduction

Chronic urticaria is a common itching skin disease characterized by wheals and/or angioedema for
more than six weeks. Chronic urticaria is divided into chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and
chronic inducible urticaria (CINDU), which is induced by specific stimuli such as heat, cold, sun

exposure or pressure [1].

The recommended treatment of chronic urticaria is oral antihistamines once daily. The dose of
antihistamines can be increased up to fourfold in case of lack of response. If symptoms still persist,

add-on therapy with omalizumab is third-line therapy, whereas cyclosporine is fourth-line [1].

Omalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, which binds to immunoglobulin E (IgE) and
thereby inhibits its binding to the high affinity receptor, FceRI on the surface of mast cells and
basophils. Thus, omalizumab reduces the level of free IgE and downregulates IgE receptors on these

cells [2].

Clinical trials have shown that treatment with omalizumab is effective on urticaria symptoms and
disease-related quality of life and also reduces the need for additional medication [2-10]. Out-of-trial
data have shown that approximately 65% of patients with CSU report complete response to
omalizumab, while 25% obtain partial response and around 15% have no or very limited response

[11]. However, prospective data on real-life response to omalizumab in CSU is still lacking.

Response patterns to omalizumab treatment in CSU vary and can be categorized as fast when
occurring already within 2-4 weeks after initiation and as slow when observed after 12-16 weeks
after initiation of treatment [12]. It is therefore recommended that omalizumab treatment is
continued for at least 6 months before considering other treatment options. The majority of patients
who show complete response to omalizumab experience relapse of symptoms within 2-8 weeks
after receiving the last dose of omalizumab; however re-treatment with omalizumab is as effective

as initial treatment [13].

Only a few patient specific factors have been shown to influence the response to omalizumab in
CSU. One retrospective study indicated that better response to omalizumab treatment is seen
among patients with a negative urticaria histamine release (HR) test, no history of angioedema and
no previous treatment with systemic immunosuppressants [14]; whereas Gericke et al. [15] and
Palacios et al. [16] found that a negative basophil activation test was associated with better
response to omalizumab. Furthermore, Ertas et al. [17] found that increased levels of serum IgE
were linked to faster relapse in CSU patients, who discontinued omalizumab treatment. However, at
present more information is needed regarding reliable biomarkers or patient specific factors, which

can be used to predict a favorable response to omalizumab in the clinical setting.

The aim of this prospective trial was to: 1) examine the effectiveness of omalizumab on CSU
symptoms and disease-related quality of life, and 2) identify possible patient specific factors

associated with response to omalizumab in patients with antihistamine refractory CSU.

Methods

All patients with CSU from a dermatological university department (Department of Dermatology,
Bispebjerg Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark) who were refractory to high-dose antihistamines and

who initiated treatment with add-on therapy of omalizumab (300 mg every four weeks) between

January 2015 and May 2017 were included in the study. The patients were evaluated before
treatment and at three and six months with patient reported outcomes (PROs); i.e. urticaria activity
score in the past week (UAS7), urticaria control test (UCT), chronic urticaria quality of life
questionnaire (CU-Q,o0L), and dermatology life quality index (DLQI). Patients were advised to
continue with high-dose antihistamines during treatment with omalizumab. Patients who were not
able to complete the PROs either by themselves or with help from health care personnel or a family

member were excluded.

Patient reported outcomes (PROs)

The UAS7 prospectively documents signs and symptoms of urticaria for seven days. UAS7 is based on
intensity of itch, which ranges from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) and number of wheals, which range from
0 (none) to 3 (>50 wheals per day). The score is summed over seven days giving a UAS7 score of 0 to
42 points. A UAS7 score of <6 corresponds to minimal disease activity; a UAS7 score of 7-15 indicates
mild urticaria, a score of 16-27 points indicates moderate urticaria, whereas severe urticaria is
characterized by a UAS7 score of 28-42 points [18]. The minimal clinically important difference in
UAS7 is equivalent to 10 points [19, 20]. The UCT is a retrospective 4-item questionnaire, which
documents control of urticaria in the past four weeks. Each question is scored from 0 to 4. A UCT
score >11 indicates well controlled disease. The minimal clinically important difference is 3 points
[21-23]. The CU-Q,oL consists of 23 questions, each ranging from 1 to 5 points. A higher score
indicates a more severe impact of the disease on quality of life. The minimal clinically important
difference is determined to be a reduction of 15 points [24, 25]. The generic DLQI is based on 10
questions and is a widely used questionnaire in dermatology for measuring quality of life. It covers
aspects such as symptoms, social activity, personal relationships and treatment associated problems.
Each question in the DLQI is scored from 0, which indicates no impact to 3, which indicates very high

impact on quality of life. The minimal clinically important difference is from 2.24 to 3.10 points [26,

27]. Another study determined the minimal clinical difference in inflammatory disease to be 4 points

[28].

Medical history

Before initiating treatment with omalizumab complete medical history and blood samples were
obtained. Physical tests for CINDU such as cold, heat or UV provocation were performed if indicated.
For each patient the following data were recorded: sex, age, age of onset of CSU, ethnicity,
comorbidities, smoking habits, presence of CINDU, presence of angioedema, result of the seruminduced basophil HR test, serum total IgE, CRP, leukocytes, absolute neutrophil count, previous
treatment with: oral corticosteroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists (montelukast), traditional
immunosuppressant drugs, administered dose of omalizumab, side effects of omalizumab and

reasons for discontinuation if treatment was discontinued.

Statistical analysis

Data were analysed with IBM SPSS Statistics (version 22). Scores of UAS7, UCT, CU,-QoL and DLQI
questionnaires were evaluated at baseline, three and six months with explanatory covariates in
linear regression analysis. The primary outcome was the UAS7 score at three months. In a previously
performed retrospective study [14] by the authors it was seen that CSU patients with a positive
urticaria HR test responded poorer to omalizumab treatment compared to patients with a negative
urticaria HR test. Therefore, this study was powered to detect at least a 10 point difference in UAS7
score (minimal clinically important difference [19, 20]) between patients with a positive urticaria HR
test compared to patients with a negative urticaria HR test from baseline to three months assuming
a standard deviation in UAS7 of 8 points, a power of 80% and a p-value of 0.05. For missing

observations data were analysed with the baseline score of UAS7 carried forward corresponding to

non-response imputation. A total of 12 patients in each group are needed to detect this difference,
and patients were sampled consecutively until 12 subjects with a positive urticaria HR test were
included. Secondary outcomes were UCT, CU-Q,o0L, and DLQI scores at three months and all PRO

scores at six months.

Results

In total 120 patients initiated treatment with omalizumab for CSU from January 2015 to May 2017
and were included in the study (Figure 1). Three patients were excluded due to missing baseline
data. Another three patients had missing data at three months, whereas seven patients were

treated with omalizumab less than three months.

Patient characteristics at baseline

There were 39 men (33.3%) and 78 women (66.7%) with a mean age of 42 years (SD=15.3, range 1277 years) (Table 1). The mean age at disease onset was 34.8 years (SD=16.9, range 4-72 years) and
the average age when treatment with omalizumab was initiated was 40.3 years (SD= 15.2, range 1073 years). The average duration of symptoms before initiation of treatment with omalizumab was
5.4 years (SD=7.5, range 0-36.5 years). Nineteen patients (25.3%) were smokers; however smoking
history was only available for 75 patients. A history of angioedema was present in 34 patients
(29.1%) and 12 patients (10.3%) had a positive serum-induced basophil histamine release (HR) test.
A total of 63 patients (53.8%) had at least one significant comorbidity. The most common
comorbidities were atopic dermatitis (14 patients), inhalant and food allergies (10), asthma (10) and
psychiatric disorders such as depression (4), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (3) and

anxiety (2).

The mean baseline score of UAS7 was 29.3 points (median=28.0; standard deviation, SD=10.8
points), and 115 patients (98.3%) reported a UCT score < 11 points (mean score=2.9, SD=2.8 points).
Mean scores of CU-Q,oL and DLQI at baseline were 70.9 (median=70.0, SD=18.9 points) and 15.8
(median=16, SD=7.6 points), respectively. Patients with a positive urticaria HR test had a higher
baseline UAS7 score compared to patients who had a negative urticaria HR test (35.4 (SD=6.1) vs.
28.6 (SD=11.0) points), p=0.041. None of the following factors were associated with UAS7 score at
baseline: sex, age, age of onset of CSU, symptom duration, presence of CINDU, angioedema,
comorbidities, ethnicity, smoking, serum total IgE, CRP, leukocytes, absolute neutrophil count or
treatment with montelukast, prednisolone or traditional immunosuppressants. At baseline the UAS7
score was significantly correlated with UCT (r=-0.426, p<0.001), CU-Q,0L (r=0.369, p<0.001) and DLQI
(r=0.439, p<0.001) (Table 3). Significant correlations were also observed between UCT, CU-Q,o0L and

DLQI (p<0.001 for all comparisons) at baseline.

Primary outcome

The mean value of UAS7 improved from 29.3 points (SD=10.8) at baseline to 11.9 points (SD=12.9) at
three months follow up; difference in UAS7=17.4 points (95% Cl=14.8-19.9 points), p<0.0001 (Figure
2). A total of 49 patients (41.9%) achieved a UAS7 score of 6 or less at three months follow up,
indicating minimal disease activity; 40 patients (34.2%) achieved a UAS7 score of 0 at three months
follow up, while nine patients (7.7 %) reported a UAS7 score between 1 and 6 points. The minimal
clinical important difference of 10 points in UAS7 was achieved in 77 patients (65.8%) at three

months follow up.

Secondary outcomes

All PROs improved significantly from baseline to three months with mean changes exceeding the
minimal clinically important difference (Figure 2). UCT improved from 2.8 to 11.0 points (SD=4.6) at
three months follow up; difference=8.2 points (95% Cl=7.2-9.2 points), p<0.001, CU2-QoL improved
from 70.9 to 43.5 points (SD=20.5); difference=27.4 points (95% Cl= 23.3-31.5 points), p<0.001 and
DLQI improved from 15.8 to 5.8 points (SD=6.6); difference=9.9 points (95% Cl= 8.3-11.5 points),
p<0.001. A significant correlation was seen between all APRO values between baseline and three
months follow up (p<0.001 for all comparisons) (Table 3). The minimal clinical important difference
in UCT, CU2-QoL and DLQI was achieved in 96 (82.1%), 81 (69.2%) and 85 (72.6%) patients,
respectively, at three months follow up. A total of 45 patients (38.5 %) achieved a DLQI score of 0 or

1 at three months.

None of the following patient specific factors: sex, age, age of onset of CSU, symptom duration,
presence of CINDU, angioedema, comorbidities, ethnicity, smoking, serum total IgE, CRP, leukocytes,
absolute neutrophil count or treatment with antihistamines, montelukast, or prednisolone were
associated with response to omalizumab at three months assessed by change in mean UAS7,
whereas a higher mean change in UAS7 score from baseline to three months was observed in
patients who were naive to traditional immunosuppressant drugs such as azathioprine,
methotrexate or cyclosporine compared to patients who had previously received traditional
immunosuppressant treatment, difference in UAS7=14.47 (95% Cl=-22.32; -6.63), p<0.001 (Table 4).
This was also observed when analysing patient specific factors in relation to changes in mean scores

of UCT, CU-Q,o0L and DLQI from baseline to three months follow up.

The above mentioned patient specific factors were also analysed with Chi-square test (categorical
factors) and unpaired t-test (continuous factors) according to response to omalizumab based on
“non-responders” vs. “responders”, i.e. patients achieving a UAS7 score of 6 or less at three months
and patients achieving the MCID in UAS7 of at least 10 points at three months. However, no

significant difference was seen between patient specific factors and responders and non-responders.

At six months follow up a total of 84 patients were still treated with omalizumab, whereas 23
patients had terminated treatment (Figure 1). No significant further improvement in PRO scores was

seen between three and six months follow up (Figure 2).

Adherence and side effects

The majority of the patients (n=114, 97.4%) were treated with omalizumab in the recommended
dose of 300 mg every 4 weeks, whereas three patients were treated with a reduced dose of 150 mg
omalizumab every 4 weeks. All three patients were under the age of 18. During omalizumab
treatment only 57 patients (48.7%) reported use of oral antihistamines although omalizumab was
intended as add-on therapy. Some patients used them daily while others used them during flare-ups.
For thirty-three patients (28.2%) treatment intervals were prolonged from every 4 weeks to every 6
weeks and further to every 8 weeks. One patient was prolonged to every 12 weeks. Side effects
were reported by 15 patients (12.8%). The most common side effects were transient hair-loss (3

patients), arthralgia (6), palpitations (2), headache (2) and fatigue (1).

Discussion

The fluctuating nature of urticaria symptoms makes it difficult for physicians to evaluate the activity
and severity of the disease. This prospective trial of the effectiveness of omalizumab in patients with
antihistamine refractory CSU showed that omalizumab treatment is highly effective in patients with
CSU and that validated PROs to assess disease activity, disease control and impairment of quality of

life are valuable tools in the clinical management of CSU.

Patients with CSU in this study had significant disease activity, low disease control and severely
affected quality of life before omalizumab treatment. Significantly reduced disease activity, well
controlled symptoms and better quality of life were achieved within three months after initiating
treatment with omalizumab and approximately 45% of the patients reported a good or very good
clinical response to omalizumab after three months of treatment (UAS7 score <7). However, further
significant improvement was not observed between three and six months of treatment. Similar
observations were reported in a retrospective study, where most patients reached a plateau of
treatment effectiveness around four to five months after initiating treatment [29]. The clinical
effectiveness of omalizumab in the current study is comparable to the observed efficacy in
randomized control trials [2-5]. We found a significant correlation between the various PRO scores
(UAS7, UCT, CU-Q,0L and DLQI) at baseline and also between the mean change in the various PRO
scores between baseline and three months follow up. These results were similar to those previously

reported [21, 30].

Side effects were reported by approximately 13% of the patients during treatment with omalizumab.
The most common side effects were transient hair loss, arthralgia, palpitations, headache and
injection side reactions. No serious side effects were reported consistently with the observations in

previous randomized controlled trials [2-5, 10].

We found that patients with a positive urticaria HR test had more severe disease activity (a higher
UAS7 score) at baseline compared to patients with a negative urticaria HR test. However, the clinical
response to omalizumab was the same in patients with a positive urticaria HR test compared to
patients with a negative urticaria HR test. In a recent study by Berti et al. [31] similar observations
were reported. However, a larger reduction in disease activity and a more frequent spontaneous
disease remission at 12 months were reported by patients with a positive urticaria HR test. This is
not congruent with several other previous studies [14-16], which have found that a positive urticaria

HR test was associated with poorer response to omalizumab treatment.

In our study we found no correlation between total serum IgE levels at baseline and response to
omalizumab, however in recent studies [32, 33] it was seen that the clinical response to omalizumab
treatment in CSU patients was linked to IgE levels. It was seen that non-responders had significantly
lower IgE levels than partial responders and complete responders. Furthermore, it was seen that IgE
levels increased in the first week after omalizumab treatment among responders, while IgE levels in

non-responders did not [32].

Patients who were previously treated with traditional immunosuppressant drugs such as
azathioprine, methotrexate or cyclosporine had a significantly poorer response to omalizumab
treatment in the present trial. Similar observations were reported in a retrospective study [14]. The
reasons for a poorer response among these patients could be more severe disease activity at onset
or long standing refractory disease. Furthermore, presence of angioedema is seen as a significant
predictor of impaired quality of life in CSU patients [34] and low response to omalizumab treatment
[14]. In our study almost 30% of the patients reported presence of angioedema, which is a bit less

compared to previous studies where almost 40-55% of the patients reported angioedema [2-4, 7-8];

however it was not possible to predict a significant difference in clinical response to omalizumab
between patients with or without angioedema. Our results were similar to the post hoc analysis
based on the randomized controlled trials [7]. The analysis reported a similar improvement in DLQI

scores regardless of whether angioedema was present at baseline or not.

The most common comorbidities in this trial were atopic dermatitis, allergies (pollen, dust, and
food), asthma, and psychiatric disorders such as depression, ADHD and anxiety. However, no
significant association was seen between comorbidities and disease activity/control or response to
omalizumab. In a population based study from Taiwan [35] the prevalence of comorbidities
increased steadily with duration of chronic urticaria. The most commonly reported comorbidities in
the Taiwan population were (non-specified) inflammatory disease followed by psychiatric disorders,
rheumatic diseases and thyroid disorders. Furthermore, in a systematic review it was seen that CSU

patients, especially females, have an increased risk of concomitant autoimmune diseases [36].

This trial was a prospective study in which validated PROs were used. Furthermore, it had a prespecified primary outcome. There were also some limitations: (1) It was carried out in only one
dermatological centre, (2) Some patients were missed during follow up, and (3) there was no control

group.

In conclusion, omalizumab is a highly effective treatment for antihistamine refractory CSU.
Furthermore, validated PROs are valuable tools in the clinical management of CSU and should be
used regularly to assess disease activity and control. Previous treatment with traditional
immunosuppressant drugs was associated with poorer treatment response to omalizumab and this

finding deserves further merit. Further studies are needed to investigate the long-term effectiveness

and response patterns of omalizumab in CSU patients and to identify patient specific factors

associated with response to omalizumab.
