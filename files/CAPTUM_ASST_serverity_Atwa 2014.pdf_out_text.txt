Abstract

Background Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common skin disorder, which is considered in a subset of
patients to be an autoimmune disorder. T helper 17 (Th17) cells are crucially involved in the pathogenesis of some autoimmune diseases.

Objectives Our aim was to test the association of Th17 with CSU. We examined interleukin (IL)-17, IL-23 and tumor
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) serum levels in CSU patients and studied their association with urticaria activity and autologous serum skin test (ASST).

Subjects and methods Serum concentration of IL-17, IL-23 and TNF-« were measured in 75 patients with CSU and
30 healthy control subjects. Disease activity was assessed by using urticaria activity score (UAS) as recommended by
EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF/WAO Guidelines.

Results Serum concentration of IL-17, IL-23 and TNF-a were significantly higher in CSU patients as compared with the
healthy control subjects (mean: 35.51 + 31.14 vs. 4.60 + 1.38 pg/mL; P < 0.001, 38.95 + 27.82 vs. 9.87 + 4.62 pg/
mL; P > 0.001 and 17.93 + 6.05 vs. 6.87 + 3.73 pg/mL; P = 0.004, respectively). There were significant positive correlation between serum IL-17, IL-23, TNF-« and disease activity assessed by cumulative UAS for 7 days before blood
sampling. The Serum concentration of IL-17, IL-23 and TNF-« were also significantly higher in ASST positive patients
than in ASST negative patients.

Conclusion Our results showed high serum levels of IL-17, IL-23 and TNF-x among CSU patients which may highlight
a functional role of these cytokines in the pathogenesis of this important and common skin disease. It also may provide
the rationale for new treatment strategies in chronic urticaria.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), formerly also known as
chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) and chronic urticaria (CU), is
a common skin disorder defined by the rapid appearance of
highly pruritic weals lasting <24 h for a time period of at least
6 weeks.’ An autoimmune etiology due to histamine-releasing
autoantibodies directed against the « subunit of high-affinity
IgE-receptor (FceRI) or IgE has been found in approximately
45% of CSU patients.” ” The autologous serum skin test (ASST)
is an in vivo screening test for histamine releasing autoantibodies

and other vasoactive factors®® and it has a high negative
predictive value (NPV).’ The inflammatory infiltrate in CSU
includes mast cells, basophils, T lymphocytes (CD4+ more than
CD8+), monocytes, neutrophils and eosinophil granulocytes.'!! Studies did not establish CSU to be associated with a
polarized T helper 1 (Th1) or Th2 milieu but demonstrated a
mainly ThO or mixed ThY/Th2 profile? As IL-17A-producing
CD4 T cells (Th17) are crucially involved in the pathogenesis of
some autoimmune diseases,'* !° CSU could be associated with
the Th17. Th17 cells are a unique subset of T helper cells

identified on the basis of their ability to produce IL-17A, IL-17F,
IL-21, IL-22, IL-6 and TNF-o.'°*° Th17 cell differentiation is
initiated by transforming growth factor-B signaling in the context of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6 as well as
IL-1 and TNF-«. Maintenance and survival of Th17 cells, in
contrast, are dependent on 1103.73

Interleukin-17 family cytokines consist of six structurally
related members, namely, IL-17A through IL-17F. IL-17A, also
called CTLA-8™* or IL-17°°, is the founding member of this family
of cytokines. IL-17A and IL-17F elicit broad proinflammatory
responses from the various tissues and cell types known to express
the IL-17R complex. IL-17A and IL-17F induce the expression of
many genes involved in tissue-mediated innate immunity. These
genes can be categorized as proinflammatory chemokines, cytokines, antimicrobial peptides, and proteins involved in tissue
remodeling and acute phase response.”° Elevated IL-17A and
IL-17F have been detected in many human autoimmune diseases,
including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and
inflammatory bowel disease,”® *° suggesting that the IL-17 pathway may play a potential pathogenic role in human diseases.

Interleukin-23 is a proinflammatory cytokine that consists of
a specific p19 subunit associated with the shared IL-12p40 subunit also called IL-12 betal subunit which associates with
IL-12p35 to form IL-12 (p70).°° IL-23 is produced by macrophages and dendritic cells and appears to play a supporting role
in the continued stimulation and survival of Th17 cells.'”*!
TNF-o is released by human skin mast cells and other inflammatory cells which can be found at the site of urticarial lesions.**
Therefore, TNF-« is a candidate mediator of urticaria.

As CSU is considered in a subset of patients to be an autoim
mune disorder® °

and Th17 cells are crucially involved in the
pathogenesis of some autoimmune diseases,'* '° Th17 may be a
possible instigator of CSU. In the present study, we aimed to
determine whether CSU is associated with alterations in IL-17,
IL-23 and TNF-a. We examined serum levels of IL-17, IL-23 and
TNF-o among CSU patients and studied whether they were

associated with urticaria activity and ASST.
Subjects and methods

Study setting

This is a case-control study of serum concentration of IL-17,
IL-23 and TNF-« in CSU patients. The study was conducted in
the dermatology clinic at Riyadh National Hospital, Riyadh,
Saudi Arabia. It was approved by the local Institutional Review
Board.

Subjects

Patients who were 12 years or older attending the dermatology
clinic who themselves or their legal guardian consented to participate after having received full information on the setup and the
purpose of the study were enrolled in this study. All of these

Atwa et al.

atients had CSU, which was diagnosed on the basis of the recurrence of spontaneous weals lasting <24 h for a time period of at
least 6 weeks.' Patients with clinical evidence of urticarial vascuitis or physically induced urticaria, patients who received corticosteroids or immunosuppressant drugs during the last 6 weeks,
and those who cannot discontinue H1 antihistamines for 7 days
efore blood sampling were excluded. In all patients, any known
causes of CU, associated inflammatory diseases or autoimmune
diseases were ruled out by appropriate investigations. Each
atient underwent the following routine laboratory tests: full

 

blood count, urine analysis, stool analysis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, hepatic functions and serum creatinine. In addition, hepatitis serology (anti-HCV, HBsAg),
tolysin-O, complement 3 (C3), C4,
antinuclear antibodies, antithyroid microsomal antibodies and

rheumatoid factor, antistre

Helicobacter pylori antigen stool test were performed to all CSU
patients. All patients had active urticaria at the time of the study
and were being treated with H1 antihistamines (cetirizine, levocetirizine, loratadine, desloratadine or fexofenadine in all
cases). These drugs were stopped 7 days before blood samples
for assay of IL-17, IL-23 and TNF-a and for ASST were taken.
Healthy, age-matched and sex-matched blood donors were
recruited as a control group after having received full information on the setup and the purpose of the study. They underwent
the same laboratory tests to exclude any inflammatory or auto
 

immune diseases.

Morning venous blood samples (5-10 mL) were taken in a
pyrogen free vacutainer tubes under sterile conditions from
patients and controls. Serum was obtained from freshly drawn,
rapidly centrifuged sample. Part of fresh serum of patients was
used for immediate ASST. Serum samples from patients and controls were quickly frozen at —70°C and stored until processed.

Assessment of urticaria activity score

Urticaria activity score (UAS) was used for assessment of disease
activity in all patients. It was calculated as recommended by
EAACI/GA?LEN/EDE/WAO Guidelines.** Weekly UAS was estimated according to the number of weals and pruritus intensity,
which had appeared during a week before the day of blood sampling. Patients were asked to document 24-h self-evaluation
scores for 7 days applying the following scheme: no weals = 0,
<20 weals/24 h = 1, 20-50 weals/24 h = 2, >50 weals/24 h = 3
and pruritus _ intensity:
severe = 3. Weekly UAS equals the sum score of 7 consecutive

no=0, mild=1, moderate = 2,
days with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 42.
Consequently, weekly UAS were graded as follows: 0-14 (mild),
15-29 (moderate) and 30-42 (severe).

Autologous serum skin test

Intradermal ASST was performed following the method recommended by EAACI/GA*LEN.’ An intradermal injection of
0.05 mL of fresh autologous serum (ASST) was carried out for

all patients at least 7 days after stopping the antihistamine therapy, and reading the weal and flare reaction at 30 min. Intradermal injection of saline solution (0.9% weight/volume NaCl) was
performed as a negative control and skin prick test with 10 mg/
mL histamine as positive control. Patients showing a red weal
with a mean diameter at least 1.5 mm greater than the control
saline solution were considered positive.

IL-17, IL-23 and TNF-a assessment

Interleukin-17 was measured by a commercial kit (IL-17 Cytoscreen, Nivelles, Belgium). This is an immunoenzymometric
assay for the quantitative measurement of human IL-17 in
serum from Biosource Europe S.A. with catalogue number
KAC1591. The minimum detectable concentration (MDC) was
2 pg/mL. IL-23 was measured by a commercial kit (Invitrogen
Human IL-23 ELISA kit, Grand Island, NY, USA). This is a solid
phase sandwich enzyme immune sorbent assay for the quantitative measurement of human IL-23 in serum from Invitrogen
Corporation USA with catalogue number KHC0231. The MDC
was <20 pg/mL. TNF-o% was measured by a commercial kit
(DIAsource TNF-« EASIA, Nivelles, Belgium). This is an immunoenzymometric assay for the quantitative measurement of
human TNF-« in serum from DIAsource S.A Rue de IIndstrie,
8, B-1400 Nivelles, Belgium with catalogue number KAP175I.
The MDC was 0.7 pg/mL. The fully automated micro-plate analyzer (Personal LAB ADALTIS machine, Rome, Italy) was used
for the three assays. An ELISA-AIDTM software used for data
processing and generating the standard curves. The software
read automatically the concentration of the assays in unknown
samples and control.

Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed using spss Software (version 17.0, SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA).** Frequency tables were produced. Test of
normality was done for collected data and for each variable, and
was not statistically significant meaning that collected data was
normally distributed. Student’s t-test was used for test of difference for quantitative variables between two groups and one-way
ANOVA (F-test) was used to compare between more than two
groups. Chi squared test was used as a test of significance for categorical variables. Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) was used
to test correlation of continuous variables. The calculated study
power exhibited that the probability is 80% that the study will
detect a relationship between the independent and the dependent variables at a two-sided 0.5 significance level, if the true
change in the dependent variables is 0.175 SDs per one SD
change in the independent variable.

Results

This study included 75 patients with CSU, and 30 healthy controls matched for age and sex. The mean age for patients and
controls were 31.8 + 10.3 and 29.7 + 9.1 years, respectively.

 

JEADV 2013

Fifty-two (69.3%) of the patients and 24 (80%) of the controls
were females. The duration of urticaria ranged from 2 to
30 months with mean duration 8.880 + 6.369 months. According to cumulative UAS for 7 days before blood sampling, the
ercentage of CSU patients with mild, moderate or severe urticaria were 29.3%, 50.7% and 20.0%, respectively. ASST was
done for all patients and showed that 33 (44%) of the patients
were positive (ASST*). Among ASST* patients, 3 (9.1%) had
mild disease, 21 (63.6%) had moderate disease and 9 (27.3%)
ad severe disease. While among ASST™ patients, 19 (45.2%)
ad mild disease, 17 (40.5%) had moderate disease and 6
(14.3%) had severe disease. This difference between ASST*
atients and ASST™ patients regarding disease activity was statistically significant (P = 0.002). ASST* patients had significantly
igher weekly UAS than ASST~ patients (mean: 27.182 + 7.724
vs. 17.405 + 8.329; P < 0.001).

 

Serum IL-17 concentration and association with disease
activity and ASST

Serum concentration of IL-17 was significantly higher in CSU
patients as compared with the healthy control subjects (mean:
35.51 + 31.14 vs. 4.60 + 1.38 pg/mL; P < 0.001). There were
statistically significant differences in serum IL-17 concentration
between the CSU patients with mild, moderate and severe symp(mean: 12.77 + 14.56, 40.32 + 28.29 and 56.67 +

functional autoantibodies against high affinity IgE receptor and/
or IgE.*° Most studies have recognized that the ASST has limited
positive predictive value for a positive basophil histamine release
assay (BHRA), ranging from 13.8% to 85%.’ However, the average NPV is 92.8% (range 81.4-100%).’ This means that a negative ASST is a useful surrogate marker of the absence of
circulating functional autoantibodies. Therefore, ASST is
recommended as a reliable clinical tool to exclude the presence
of functional circulating autoantibodies detectable by the
BHRA.’ In the present study, 56% of CSU patients had negative
ASST which pointed to lack of functional circulating autoantibodies in them, while 44% of patients had positive ASST which
may indicate the presence of functional circulating autoantibodies and an autoimmune basis for their disease.

A full understanding of the pathogenesis of CSU has yet to be
achieved. Examination of biopsies from urticaria patients demonstrated that most of the infiltrating T cells possessed a CD4+
helper phenotype.*° The cytokine pattern showed that skin biopsies of patients with CU resemble the Th0 cytokine profile with
increased levels of IL-4, IL-5 and interferon (IFN)-y messenger
(m)RNA+ cells.'' Thi and Th17 cells may collaboratively contribute to human autoimmune diseases.*” These observations
support the notion that Th17 may be a possible instigator of CSU.

In the present study, to gain better understanding of the proinflammatory process in CSU or the possible autoimmune basis in
some patients we aimed to determine whether CSU is associated
with alterations in IL-23/IL-17 axis and TNF-o We found that
CSU patients as a whole had significantly high serum levels of
oth IL-17 and IL-23, and ASST CSU patients had higher levels
than those with negative ASST. Elevated IL-17A and IL-17F have
een detected in many human autoimmune diseases, including
soriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease,”° *° This role in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases may explain the high serum level of IL-17 in CSU
atients and higher level in ASST* CSU patients compared to
ASST CSU patients. To our knowledge, no study has reported
increased levels of this cytokine in CSU. Inconsistent with our
results, Daschner et al.*® found lower serum IL-17 levels in

 

atients with CU with sensitization against Anisakis simplex
(CU*) and CU patients without sensitization against Anisakis
simplex (CU) compared with patients without history of urticaria and patients with past gastro-allergic anisakiasis. The
authors suggested that diminished IL-17 levels are because of consumption in the inflammatory process. In addition, the study was
conducted on a small number of patients (19 CU patients without
sensitization against Anisakis simplex). In another study, Azor et
al.*? found that levels of IFN-y, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-17A induced
by peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated by phytohaemaglutinin (PHA) did not differ between healthy control or CIU
patients and were decreased significantly by simvastatin.

Recent reports have indicated that, in humans, increased
amounts of IL-23 have been associated with the several auto
JEADV 2013

immune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, Lyme arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn’s disease, psoriasis,
dermatomyositis and multiple sclerosis.*° ” The present study
showed that ASST* CSU patients had higher serum IL-23 levels compared to ASST” CSU patients. Also, IL-23 level correated with urticaria activity in CSU patients as a whole which
suggests that it may play a role in CSU pathogenesis; especially
in patients with functional autoantibodies. This is the first
study to report on the serum level of IL-23 in CSU. IL-23 is a
ey cytokine for the generation of peripheral effector Th17
cells.*? It can induce chronic inflammation through two indeendent pathways. One pathway is by the activation of Th17
cells and the second by the induction of the secretion of IL-17
y non-T cells.'**4

Our results also showed high levels of serum TNF-o in CSU
atients as a whole, and its level was positively correlated with
UAS. TNF-a is released by human skin mast cells and other
inflammatory cells which can be found at the site of urticarial
esions.”? Th17 cells produce IL-17A, IL-17E, IL-21, IL-22, IL-6
and TNF-«.'° °° Tillie-Leblond et al.*° found that TNF-a release
during a systemic reaction occurring after cold immersion test
in two patients with cold urticaria. An increased immunoreactivity for TNF-« and IL-3 was detected on endothelial and perivascular cells of the upper dermis in skin lesions from CU
patients.*° In a study by Piconi et al.*”, IL-10 production after
stimulation with PHA was elevated together with TNF-o, MIPla and RANTES. In agreement with our results, Dos Santos et
al. found that cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-1b, IL12p70 and IL-6
have been elevated in most patients with CU.** On the other
hand, no evidence of detectable TNF-« in serum could be stated

 

in another study by Tedeschi et al.”

In summary, our results showed high serum levels of IL-17,
IL-23 and TNF-« among CSU patients which may highlight a
functional role of these cytokines in the pathogenesis of this
important and common skin disease, and may provide another
valuable insight into the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of CSU. However, more studies are needed on more patients
to study different Thl, Th2 and Th17 cytokines in serum and
skin of CSU patients. Our results also may support the trial of
therapeutic approaches targeting IL-17, IL-23 and TNF-o in
patients with recalcitrant CSU.
