Basophil count is a sensitive marker for clinical progression in a
chronic spontaneous urticaria patient treated with omalizumab

Dear Editor,

Omalizumab is a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody that has been
approved to treat antihistamine-refractory, chronic spontaneous
urticaria (CSU). By blocking circulating IgE, omalizumab can prevent IgE attaching to the high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) on
mast cells, basophils, and probably other FceRI-expressing cells,
including antigen-presenting cells. Because peripheral IgE levels
are highly associated with FceRI cell surface expression, the efficacy
of treatment with omalizumab may also be due to secondary suppression of cell function by reducing this receptor's expression.
However, the precise mechanism of how omalizumab improves
CSU remains largely unclear.'?

A 67-year-old male with a 6-year history of severe CSU had undergone treatment with antihistamines, then up-dosing of antihistamines alone, and finally switched to combination with H2
blockers and cyclosporine. Due to being refractory to all previous
treatments, the patient was started on omalizumab therapy at a
dose of 300 mg every 4 weeks, which showed a curative effect after
only one dose in the first week. Since wheals appeared on his body
ten weeks after the fourth treatment, we restarted omalizumab at
the same dose and his symptom was relieved again within 3 days.

During omalizumab treatment, we followed basophil behavior
by flow cytometric analysis after obtaining informed consent,
which was approved by the IRB of Kansai Medical University. One
hundred microliters of whole EDTA blood were incubated with
CRA1-Billiant violet (BioLegend, San Diego, CA), CRA2-biotin (Bio
Academia, Osaka, Japan), streptavidin-APC (BD, San Jose, CA) and
antibodies for CRTH2-FITC, CD203c-PE and CD3-PECy7 (Allergenecity kit, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) for 15 min. Cells were then lysed
and fixed for 10 min, and analyzed on a FACS Canto II (BD). Forward
scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) were used to select the cell population, and then basophils were identified as CD3-negative and
CRTH2-positive cells (Fig. 1(a)).

Both CRA1 and CRA2 are anti-FceRI antibodies.’ Since CRA1 reacts with a region other than the IgE binding site, we can evaluate
total expression levels of IgE receptor by CRA1. One week after the
initiation of omalizumab, his symptoms were relieved with an
accompanying dramatic decrease of the cell surface CRA1 levels
on peripheral basophils. After 4 doses of treatment, the mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of CRA1 remained low (Fig. 1(b),(c)). In parallel with his CSU symptoms, 10 weeks after ceasing omalizumab

treatment, the MFI of CRA1 increased with the relapse of wheals,
and decreased again once the treatment was restarted. Conversely,
CRA2 recognizes the IgE binding site and competes with IgE;
thereby, we can estimate the free receptor not bound to IgE by
CRA2 expression.’ Before omalizumab treatment, we did not find
any CRA2-positive basophils, indicating that all FceRI on the circulating basophils were occupied with IgE. We can observe CRA2positive basophils only after the initiation of omalizumab, clearly
demonstrating that omalizumab treatment sufficiently neutralized
circulating IgE in this patient (Fig. 1(d)).

CD203c, a multifunctional ectoenzyme involved in the clearance of extracellular nucleotides, has been used as an activation
marker for basophils, and in this study we used this activation
marker for the evaluation of peripheral basophil condition without
any stimuli. CD203c intensity increased after the initiation of omalizumab (Fig. 1(e)), even though CSU eruptions were dramatically
improved after omalizumab treatment. This paradoxical phenomenon suggests that peripheral circulating basophils seem to be
activated after omalizumab treatment, which has also been reported by others.*

Interestingly, the peripheral basophil count had been persistently low at almost 0 cells/l for at least 1 year prior to omalizumab
treatment. One week after omalizumab injection, basophil
numbers increased to 8.4 cells/l. During treatment with omalizumab, the number of basophils was between 8.4 cells/yl and
18.8 cells/ul. Ten weeks after stopping omalizumab, wheals
appeared again and basophil numbers returned to 0 cells/l. Three
days after resuming omalizumab, the basophil count once again
increased to 9 cells/,l (Fig. 2). Thus, basophil count was well correlated with the clinical course of CSU, and restoring basophil
numbers may indicate that CSU is under control. The underlying
mechanism may be explained by the recruitment of peripheral basophils into the tissue, which evokes hives reactions during the
active phase of CSU. We believe in this situation that activated basophils migrate into local sites and only non-activated basophils
remain in the peripheral blood when the patient shows CSU symptoms. This may explain the paradoxical phenomenon that CD203c
expression actually increased after omalizumab treatment when
hives were under control and basophil numbers remained normal
in peripheral blood. Our findings are consistent with other previous
reports showing an increase in the basophil count in peripheral
blood during treatment with antihistamines.” We should point

out that there is a limitation in our studies because we substitute
peripheral basophils instead of dermal mast cells or local basophils
migrated into the tissue in order to evaluate the effectiveness of
omalizumab.

In conclusion, we believe that peripheral basophil count may
be a potential and easy marker for assessing the condition of
CSU. We hope our findings aid in the discovery of more insights
into the underlying mechanisms of how omalizumab actually
works in treating this challenging disease. Further long-term
follow-up investigations including a large number of patients
will be required in order to validate the value of basophil counts
in clinical practice.
