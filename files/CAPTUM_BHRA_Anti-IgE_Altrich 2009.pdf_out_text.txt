urticaria

ABSTRACT

Previous studies indicate that 30-50% of chronic urticaria patients have an autoimmune etiology. Clinical diagnosis of
autoimmune urticaria is supported with the autologous serum skin test. The purpose of this study was to compare two
laboratory tests for measurement of IgG autoantibodies to IgE or IgE receptors and compare the results with the autologous
serum and plasma skin tests. We performed skin tests and two functional in vitro tests, basophil histamine release, and CD63
up-regulation to detect autoantibodies relevant to autoimmune urticaria. Both sera and citrated plasma were evaluated in the
autologous skin test and histamine release assay. Thyroid autoantibodies were also measured. Basophils were incubated with
patient plasma, sera, buffer, or anti-IgE. The cells were analyzed for CD63 expression and the supernatants were recovered for
histamine analysis. There was high correlation between CD63 up-regulation and histamine release assays, but histamine release
was more sensitive. There was a high concordance between sera and citrated plasma for the skin test. Sera from chronic urticaria
patients produced higher mean histamine release (23%) compared with citrated plasma (12%). Thirty-one percent of patients
positive in the histamine release assay were also positive for thyroid autoantibodies. This compares with 12% who were negative
in the histamine release assay. These data show that in vitro basophil histamine release can be used to measure antibodies to
FceRI, FceRU/CD23, or IgE and identify patients with autoimmune urticaria.

chronic urticaria is not life-threatening, it can adversely
affect a patient’s quality of life. One report relates the
stress from chronic urticaria as equivalent to that of a
patient waiting for bypass surgery and indicates that
chronic urticaria affects the quality of life in multiple
areas including work, social life, home relationships,
and_hobbies.** Although chronic urticaria primarily
affects adults, recent reports document that it is also
prevalent in children.*° Although the cause of urticaria
is often unclear; multiple investigators have indicated

an autoimmune etiology in 30-50% of chronic urticaria
patients.”-'9 Recent evidence has also suggested that
the basophils in patients with chronic urticaria may be
disregulated.'4~'®

The first reports of autoimmune chronic urticaria
were indirect. In the 1960s there were reports that
antibody-antigen interactions could cause basophil/
mast cell degranulation.'” Moreover, an association between chronic urticaria and autoimmune thyroid disease has been recognized since the early 1980s.7°?!
Specifically, it has been shown that a higher percentage
of patients with chronic urticaria show autoantibodies
against either thyroid peroxidase (TPO) or thyroglobulin (Tg)” than a normal healthy population. There is
also evidence that HLA DRB4 class II alleles may predispose individuals to autoimmune chronic urticaria.?*

The earliest direct evidence for autoimmune chronic
urticaria comes from studies that showed that the injection of patient serum into the dermis of the skin
caused a wheal and flare response. This in vivo test, the
autologous serum skin test (ASST), was first used in
the 1940s to diagnose autoimmune chronic urticaria.”*
A later report found that this response was only detected if the disease was active.?°”° The active factor in
the serum was shown to be heat stable at 56°C. Subsequent work identified the serum factor as an IgG autoantibody, which, in most cases, was directed against

the IgE receptor on cutaneous mast cells and less frequently to IgE itself.2”-3! A recent report by Asero ef al.
suggested that the autologous plasma skin test (APST)
was a more sensitive assay than the ASST for detecting
autoantibodies in chronic urticaria. This report has
not been confirmed by others.

Detailed analysis has shown that the antireceptor
autoantibodies bind to either the a2-subunit of the IgE
receptor and compete with IgE for binding or to the
al-subunit, in which case they are noncompetitive.
Other studies have suggested that only IgG1 and IgG3.
subclasses are responsible for autoimmune chronic urticaria and that complement activation is involved.
IgG1 and IgG3 are efficient in activating the complement cascade leading to C5a generation and this peptide is a potent histamine releaser from mast cells.°°

Performance of the ASST is time-consuming and requires an on-site laboratory to prepare the serum and
experience performing immediate allergy skin testing.
There is also a risk of injecting the wrong serum into a
patient. Therefore, the availability of a commercial in
vitro diagnostic test would facilitate the diagnosis of
autoimmune chronic urticaria. In vitro assays for the
diagnosis of autoimmune chronic urticaria have been
used for several years but heretofore have only been
available in research facilities. One obstacle that has
slowed the development of routine clinical tests for
autoimmune chronic urticaria is the lack of a gold
standard test to establish positive and negative predictive values. Some consider the ASST to be that standard; and others feel the basophil histamine test should
be considered the gold standard.

These prior research studies used both donor mast
cells and basophils to look for autoantibodies in patient
sera. In addition, basophils from both atopic and
nonatopic donors have been used and some reports
indicate that basophils from atopic donors are more
sensitive.°° Initial experiments used histamine release
to measure the degree of basophil activation, hence, the
presence of autoantibodies. More recently, up-regulation of basophil surface activation markers CD63 or
CD208c has been used.°3°-°?

In the current study we compared two in vivo and
two in vitro diagnostic tests for autoimmune chronic
urticaria. The in vivo autologous skin test compared
both serum and citrated plasma, and the in vitro tests
compared histamine release with CD63 up-regulation.
We also evaluated thyroid function and antithyroid
autoantibody levels in the same group of chronic urticaria patients.

We found a high degree of concordance with serum
and plasma in the autologous skin test, but a higher
percentage of histamine release with serum. In vitro,
histamine release and CD63 were both useful in the
diagnosis of autoimmune chronic urticaria, but histamine release was more sensitive. Similar to other in
 

Allergy and Asthma Proceedings

vestigations, we found that chronic urticaria patients
had a higher incidence of thyroid autoantibodies. This
study indicates that serum and plasma are comparable
for in vivo skin testing but serum is better than plasma
for performing in vitro assays. Furthermore, in vitro
basophil histamine release is a useful diagnostic test for
confirming the diagnosis of autoimmune chronic urticaria.

METHODS

Patients and Controls

One hundred one patients from an allergy practice
who fit established criteria for chronic urticaria and 11
healthy controls were selected for study. Patients had
no identifiable trigger in any case. Patients had autologous skin testing performed and serum and plasma
samples were taken for in vitro analysis. Controls were
not skin tested but provided specimens for use in vitro.
All study participants provided informed consent.

Skin Testing

To perform the ASST and APST, 50 wL of autologous
serum (ASST) or plasma (APST) was injected intradermally into the patient’s forearm. Equal volumes of
histamine (0.10 mg/mL; Hollister-Stier Laboratories,
Spokane, WA) and saline served as the positive and
negative controls. Immediately after injection the sizes
of the wheal and flare in millimeters at each site were
recorded. Measurements were made again after 15
minutes, and in some individuals readings were also
taken at 30 minutes. In preliminary studies skin tests
were read at 15, 30, and 60 minutes. All positive reactions were observed within 30 minutes and longer
observation did not alter the results. A positive result
was defined as an increase in the wheal reaction size of
>3 mm with no change or reduction in size of the
saline control.

In Vitro Autoimmune Chronic Urticaria Testing

CD63 Up-Regulation. Sodium heparinized whole
blood collected from a single nonatopic donor was
used as a source of basophils throughout the study.
Basophils were enriched by an initial slow 200 x g
centrifugation; the plasma and buffy coat were removed and centrifuged at 500 x g. After the second
centrifugation, the plasma was discarded. The enriched basophil preparation was diluted in stimulation
buffer containing IL-3 (FLOW CAST kit; ALPCO, Salem, NH) and incubated with either patient sera, a
buffer control, or anti-FceRIa (FLOW CAST kit) as a
positive control for 30 minutes at 37°C. Cells were
stained with anti-IgE fluorescein isothiocyanate and
anti-CD63 phycoerythrin (FLOW CAST kit) and analyzed on the FC500 (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA).

Basal level of CD63 expression was determined with
the negative control.

Histamine Release. Enriched basophils prepared as
described previously were diluted in stimulation
buffer containing IL-3 and incubated with patient or
control sera or plasma, buffer control, or anti-IgE (2
g/mL; Beckman Coulter) as a positive control for 30
minutes in a 37°C water bath. The cells were then
centrifuged and the supernatants were recovered. Two
aliquots of cells were lysed by three rounds of freeze
and thaw for determination of total histamine content.
Using a quantitative enzyme immunoassay (Beckman
Coulter), the histamine released into the supernatant
was measured and compared to the total histamine in
the basophils to generate a percent histamine release.

Thyroid Autoantibody Measurement

Levels of serum antibodies against TPO and Tg were
measured on the Immulite 2000 (Siemens, Los Angeles,
CA). Normal reference values were based on manufacturer’s recommendation. Normal values are <35
IU/mL for anti-TPO and <40 IU/mL for anti-Tg. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in serum were
measured using the Rapid TSH kit (Siemens) also on
the Immulite 2000. For this method the normal reference range is between 0.4 and 4.0 mIU/mL.

Statistics

Regression analysis was used to compare the CD63
and histamine assays. Technologists who performed
the in vitro assays were blinded to the skin test results.

RESULTS

Comparison between Histamine Release and CD63
Up-Regulation

A single donor was used for the studies illustrated in
this article. The donor went through a qualification
process before his basophils were selected for in vitro
assays. Initially, donor basophils were incubated with
a panel of control (nonchronic urticaria) sera and the
positive control, anti-IgE. To qualify the donor’s basophils for testing, the cells had to show low percent
histamine release and CD63 expression when incubated with control sera and high percent histamine
release and CD63 expression in response to anti-IgE.

A positive result in each test was based on the mean
plus two standard deviations of a control population.
For the histamine release assay the mean plus two
standard deviations was 12.9% and 16.4% for CD63.
Validation of the histamine release assay showed an
intra-assay variability of 8% and an inter-assay variability of 5.3%. Sera from ASST* chronic urticaria (CU)
patients (n = 24) produced a mean histamine release of
28.4% compared with 9.5% with sera from ASST” CU

donor basophils to up-regulate CD63, compared with
11.9% for ASST” CU sera and 9.0% for control sera
(Fig. 1 B). In this study, 55% of ASST* CU and 14% of
ASST” CU patients were positive in the histamine

ASST” CU patients were positive in the CD63 assay.
Although the correlation coefficient between the results of the two assays was low (7 = 0.54; Fig. 2), the
concordance (positive versus negative) was higher
(75%; Table 1). The histamine release assay showed
higher sensitivity.

Comparison between ASST and APST

A recent report suggested that performing the autologous skin test with citrated plasma rather than serum
resulted in a higher percentage of positive results.°* We

mean histamine release of 22.7%, and citrated plasma
induced a mean histamine release of only 11.5% (p <
0.01). This lower mean percentage of histamine release
with citrated plasma also resulted in a lower percentage of samples that were scored positive; 41.5% of
serum samples resulted in a positive result compared
with only 20% with citrated plasma. Figure 3 is a
graphic representation of these data. This indicates that
functional autoantibodies can be detected with both
serum and citrated plasma; however, serum is the better specimen and the only specimen accepted for clinical testing.

Correlation between Autoimmune Thyroid Disease
and Chronic Urticaria

Previous studies have found a higher occurrence of
autoimmune thyroid disease in chronic urticaria patients compared with healthy controls.”” In this study
we measured the levels of anti-Tg, anti-TPO, and TSH
in a subset of chronic urticaria patients. A greater percentage of patients that tested positive in the histamine
release assay had thyroid autoantibodies (Table 3). The
presence of these autoantibodies did not result in abnormal TSH levels in most patients. This indicates that
patients remained euthyroid despite the presence of
circulating thyroid autoantibodies. The same correlation held true when patients were grouped based on
reactivity in the ASST (Table 3).

DISCUSSION

Chronic urticaria is a difficult disease in which to
establish the etiology. A major advance in recent years
has been the recognition that 30-50% of chronic urticaria patients have an underlying autoimmune disease
causing the disorder.” However, diagnosis of the
autoimmune form has been limited to specialty clinics
with in-house laboratories able to perform the autologous skin test and university research groups that are
capable of performing in vitro testing to identify relevant autoantibodies. This has left a deficit in routine
clinical practice. Here, we describe the standardization
of the in vitro histamine release test for use in routine
diagnostic testing. Also, we compared the use of serum
and plasma for performing in vivo and in vitro tests and
verified previous reports that document elevated thyroid autoantibodies in patients with chronic urticaria.

Our results extend the findings of other groups indicating that in vitro functional tests can be used in the
diagnosis of autoimmune chronic urticaria.'’!* Our
results agree with others in the literature and an imperfect correlation between in vitro functional tests and
the results of the ASST test. The reason for these differences is unclear. One explanation may be that the
skin test measures the response of mast cells, whereas
the in vitro assays use basophils.’ It is interesting to
note that patients with chronic urticaria have involvement of skin mast cells but have less involvement of
other tissue mast cells such as those in the lung and
gastrointestinal tract.

Both histamine release and CD63 up-regulation are
useful assays to measure the activation of donor basophils. However, because of the availability of a standardized histamine ELISA, the ease of batching samples and a better concordance of histamine release and
ASST results rather than CD63 up-regulation and
ASST results, we have standardized the histamine
ELISA for commercial use. In this study we also performed further analysis comparing citrated plasma
and serum as specimens for use in the assay. Our data
indicate that both specimens can induce histamine release from donor basophils; however, serum results in
a higher percentage of positive results. The reason for
this difference is not clear.

When comparing serum and citrated plasma in the in
vivo autologous skin test we found a high 87.7% concordance between the matched sets of specimens. This
is in contrast to a recent report from Asero et al. suggesting that the use of citrated plasma was more sensitive in detecting autoantibodies against IgE and/or
IgE receptors.*? We have no clear explanation why
there is a discrepancy between the Asero study and
ours; however, our finding agrees with most of the
published literature that used serum to perform this
test. The presence of the citrate in the plasma may
increase the threshold necessary for histamine release
in the donor basophils. It appears that either serum or
citrated plasma can be used in the skin test to diagnose
autoimmune chronic urticaria.

It may also be useful to evaluate all patients with
chronic urticaria for thyroid function and thyroid-specific autoantibodies. Previous studies”* have shown a
higher frequency of thyroid-specific autoantibodies in
chronic urticaria patients when compared with the
general population and our data show that a higher
percentage of patients with autoimmune chronic urticaria, confirmed either with a skin or in vitro test, have
thyroid antibodies than chronic urticaria patients with
negative skin or histamine release tests. This does not
suggest a cause and effect relationship between autoimmune chronic urticaria and autoimmune thyroid
disease. It more likely suggests that individuals that
are predisposed to one autoimmune disease are at risk
of other types of autoimmune pathology. Although
most patients with thyroid autoantibodies are euthyroid, there are isolated case reports of chronic urticaria
patients improving with thyroxin treatment.°” Furthermore, the detection of thyroid autoantibodies may precede the development of hypothyroidism and this test
can serve as a marker to be followed serially over time.

Diagnosis of autoimmune chronic urticaria is important in clinical practice. First, it gives the patient peace
of mind by understanding the etiology of their disease.
Second, it should reduce the use of allergy skin tests to
foods or aeroallergens that are often incorrectly identified as causal factors. In addition, by providing a
mechanistic explanation it should eliminate unproven
treatments such as rotation diets, food elimination tri

als, and preservative and dye-free diets. For the same
reason, the test result may prevent patients from
searching for treatments from alternative practitioners.
Patients with chronic urticaria may require immunomodulatory therapy such as cyclosporine, methotrexate, or hydroxyc! hloroquine.**~*° These medications
can be used if patients fail to respond to front-line
treatment with non- or low-sedating antihistamines
such as cetirizine, levocetirizine,’”** fexofenadine,*” loratadine,° desloratadine,*! or sedating antihistamine
such as hydroxine or doxapim even at higher than
recommended doses.** Cyclosporine has been studied
extensively with chronic urticaria patients in combination with antihistamines. A double-blind study with
ASST" patients found significant benefit with the use
of 4 mg/kg of daily cyclosporine.*! Cyclosporine has
also been shown to be effective in ASST* patients at
doses of 2.5-5 mg/kg.*?4

Methotrexate***> and hydroxychloroquine*® have
also been shown to be effective in limited studies. In
clinical practice, weekly pulse therapy with methotrexate has been beneficial in producing control and/or
complete remission in ~70% of patients.’° The drug is
given weekly starting at 7.5 mg the Ist week and 15 mg
each week thereafter. Once control is complete, antihistamines should be gradually reduced and stopped,
and if the patient is symptom free without antihistamines, methotrexate can be reduced by 2.5 mg weekly.
Hydroxychloroquine has also been used with benefit,
but controlled studies are lacking. The usual adult dose
is 200 mg twice daily.

Many physicians now recognize autoimmune urticaria as a distinct subgroup of chronic urticaria patients and exclude them from the “idiopathic” category. Practicing allergists report that the determination
of an autoimmune etiology is clinically helpful because, as mentioned, it reduces the need for extensive
testing in search of an exogenous cause and, ultimately, may reduce unnecessary laboratory testing. In
addition, immunomodulatory drugs may be initiated
sooner in chronic urticaria patients who are known to
have an autoimmune process. For these reasons, a
widely available in vitro test to identify the autoantibodies to FceRI, IgE, or FceRII/CD23 should be very
useful to all physicians treating patients with chronic
urticaria.
