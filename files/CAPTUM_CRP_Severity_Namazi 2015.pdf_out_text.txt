Serum levels of hypersensitive-C -reactive
protein in moderate and severe acne

VI. R. Namazi'2, A. R. Parhizkar?, FE Jowkar

ABSTRACT

 

Background: Elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP) has been reported to occur in psoriasis, urticaria, acne,
rosacea and many other dermatological and nondermatological conditions. Chronic systemic inflammation has
been implicated in the development of neuropsychiatric/degenerative disorders, atherosclerosis, coronary artery
disease, diabetes mellitus and even carcinogenesis. The present study is designed to determine whether the
level of inflammation created by acne vulgaris could be high enough to raise the serum levels of high-sensitive
CRP. Materials and Methods: Forty-two patients with moderate and severe acne vulgaris were enrolled,
along with 44 age and sex matched healthy blood donors as controls. Hypersensitive-CRP (Hs-CRP) was
measured in both groups. Results: Hypersensitive-C-reactive protein levels in the case group varied between
0 and 28.1 ug/ml with an average of 2.24 + 4.87 g/ml (mean + standard deviation) and a median of 0.6 g/ml
(interquartile range [IQR] =0.3, 1.4 g/ml). Hs-CRP levels of the control group varied between 0 and 14 ttg/ml
with an average of 3.12 + 3.67 ug/ml and a median of 1.5 ug/ml (IQR = 0.55, 5.0 ug/ml). No significant difference
of Hs-CRP level between the two groups was seen (¢ = —0.961, 95% confidence interval: Lower = —2.6942,
upper = 0.9377; P = 0.339). Additionally, no significant difference in the level of Hs-CRP was noted between
the moderate and severe acne groups (95% confidence interval: Lower = —5.2495, upper = 1.6711; P= 0.165).
Conclusion: Acne vulgaris, even in its severe grades (excluding acne fulminans and acne conglobata), does not
induce significant inflammation at the systemic level.

 

Key words: Chronic inflammation, hypersensitive-C-reactive protein, inflammatory acne

INTRODUCTION

Acne vulgaris is one of the most common skin
disorders to affect humans, characterized
by both inflammatory (papules, pustules,
nodules and cysts) and non-inflammatory
lesions (comedones). Propionibacterium acnes
is known to be implicated in the pathogenesis
of inflammatory acne. Infiltration of CD4* T-cells
of «B* phenotype and T-helper 1 (Th1) cytokine
profile (high levels of interferon-y and low levels
of interleukin-4 [IL-4]) have been demonstrated
within the acne follicle. This could be regarded as
a cellular immune response against the P. acnes
antigens within the follicular lumen. Furthermore,
P. acnes contributes to the inflammatory
nature of acne by inducing monocytes via toll
like receptor 2 dependent pathways to secrete
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8, and
IL-12.! IL-8 along with other P. acnes-induced
chemotactic factors may play an important role
in attracting neutrophils to the pilosebaceous
unit. Consequent release of lysosomal enzymes

Indian Dermatology Online Journal - July-August 2015 - Volume 6 - Issue 4

by the neutrophils leads to rupture of the
follicular epithelium and further inflammation.
IL-12 promotes the development of Th1-mediated
immune responses. In addition, P. acnes
releases lipases, proteases, and hyaluronidases
that contribute to tissue injury and potentiate the
inflammation further.2! Furthermore, P. acnes
induces the monocytes in acne lesions to
produce high levels of IL-1 and tumor necrosis
factor-a (TNF-a).®! Thus, acne is local chronic
inflammatory state that could potentially become
systemic.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is one of the best
indicators of systemic inflammation, considering
that its serum levels show no circadian change
across the 24 h."! IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-o that are
found in the acne lesions are also major inducers
CRP production by the liver. Thus, CRP levels
could be elevated in acne if the amount of
local inflammation is high enough. The present
study was designed to test the aforementioned
theory. The advent of highly sensitive methods

Namazi, et al.: HsCRP in moderate to severe acne vulgaris

to measure CRP has made it possible to detect very small
increases of this inflammatory marker.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This was a case-control study. Because CRP distribution
is positively skewed and statistical analysis on the basis
of available data from other studies stipulated a very large
sample size that would be impractical, our statistical consultant
suggested that all eligible cases and controls reporting within
a predicted period of six months be selected. We arrived at a
minimum sample size of 40 each for cases and controls.

Forty-two otherwise-healthy patients with moderate to severe
inflammatory acne vulgaris living in Fars province, Iran
were sequentially enrolled in the study. Exclusion criteria
included systemic or topical anti-acne therapy in the previous
month and conditions that could affect CRP levels such as
smoking, hypertension, sedentary life-style, elevated body
mass index, strict diet, moderate alcohol consumption,
increased activity/endurance exercise, coexistent chronic
inflammatory conditions other than acne such as rheumatic
disease, chronic infections, cancer, sleep disorders, diabetes
mellitus, polycystic ovary syndrome, metabolic syndrome,
hyperlipidemia, and intake of estrogen/progesterone pills,
statins, fibric acid derivatives or niacin." Additionally, patients
with acne fulminans and acne conglobata were excluded from
the study. Participants were excluded by meticulous history
taking and physical examination; no laboratory investigations
were done in this regard.

Severity classification of patients was done using a modification
in Combined Acne Severity Classification system: As
comedones are not inflammatory lesions, comedonal criteria
were omitted and only inflammatory lesions were taken into
account. Lesions of chest and back were also included.
Acne was regarded as severe if there were more than
50 inflammatory or 5 cystic lesions. Patients with inflammatory
lesion count ranging between 20 and 50 were labeled as
moderate acne vulgaris. Informed consent was taken of both
cases and controls. The study was approved by local University
Ethics Committee.

Forty-four age and sex matched voluntary blood donors
from Fars province, Iran who reported to the regional Blood
Transfusion Organization were included as a control group.
Blood donor controls were screened according to the available
data in their pre-phlebotomy assessment charts.

The selected participants were referred to the laboratory
for hypersensitive-CRP (Hs-CRP) measurement. The blood
samples (5 cc clotted blood) were centrifuged, and the resultant
sera were frozen at —70°C and kept refrigerated till the time
of measurement. The serum from blood donors are also

254

transferred to the selected laboratory to be frozen and kept till
the time of measurement.

Hypersensitive-C-reactive protein levels of the sera of case
and control groups were measured using ELISA method
(Sandwich ELISA) in one session using standard calibration
solutions provided by the manufacturer (Product Code:
3125-300, Monobind Inc., Lake Forest, CA 92630, USA). CRP
levels were quantified by a microplate reader that measured
the amount of light being absorbed at 450 nm. CRP levels are
calculated as ug/ml of serum. ELISA kit sensitivity for CRP
measurement was 0.2 ug/ml.

Statistical analysis of the results was performed using SPSS
software (version 15 for IBM; SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois).
Because the CRP distribution is positively skewed, median,
as well as mean, standard deviation (SD) and interquartile
range (IQR) of the data were calculated. Unpaired t-test was
used to compare the means of the two groups. Because the
number of cases and controls was above 30, skewness of CRP
distribution had negligible effect on the results of the t-test.
Comparison of CRP levels between moderate and severe acne
cases was achieved using nonparametric methods (comparison
of medians by Mann-Whitney U-test) because the number
of samples for each group was below 30. P < 0.05 were
considered significant.

 

RESULTS

There were 42 cases and 44 controls. No significant statistical
differences with respect to sex and age were noted between
the two groups (P = 0.598 for a sex difference in the Chi-square
test and P = 0.501 for mean age difference in t-test).

Hypersensitive-C-reactive protein levels in the case
group varied between 0 and 28.1 g/ml with an average
of 2.24 + 4.87 ug/ml (mean + SD) and a median of
0.6 ug/ml (IQR = 0.3, 1.4 ug/ml). CRP levels of the control
group varied between 0 and 14 ug/ml with an average of
3.12 + 3.67 g/ml and a median of 1.5 g/ml (IQR = 0.55,
5.0 ug/ml). Table 1 summarizes all the available data for the
two groups. Histograms of CRP distribution in the case and
control groups are presented in Figure 1.

Statistical analysis using two independent sample t-test showed
no significant difference in the mean level of Hs-CRP between
case and control groups (ft = —0.961, 95% confidence interval:
Lower = —2.6942, upper = 0.9377; 2-tailed, P = 0.339).

There were 22 cases with moderate acne and 20 cases with
severe acne. Chi-square test for sex difference between the
two groups was statistically significant (P = 0.002), indicating
that the two groups were not sex matched. No significant
statistical difference was noted in terms of age between the two

groups (P= 0.250). The medians of CRP levels in the moderate
and severe acne groups were 0.45 pg/ml (IQR = 0.275,
0.90 pg/ml) and 0.7 ug/ml (IQR = 0.40, 3.25 g/ml) respectively.

upon nonparametric analysis by 2-tailed Mann—Whitney U-test
(95% confidence interval: Lower = —5.2495, upper = 1.6711;

DISCUSSION

C-reactive protein is an acute-phase protein that appears after
injury, infection, or inflammation and disappears when the injury
heals, or when the infection or inflammation subsides. CRP is
synthesized exclusively by the liver in response to inflammatory
cytokines, especially IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-o. Although IL-6 levels
display circadian variability, CRP levels have been shown
to be quite stable across 24 h.!451 When measured with
high-sensitivity assays, the population distribution of CRP
has generally been consistent across sex and ethnic groups:
Values of 0.3, 0.6, 1.5, 3.5, and 6.6 g/l have been reported
as estimates of the 10", 25", 50", 75", and 90" percentiles
respectively for middle-aged people. Furthermore, CRP
levels are not altered by food intake.) Thus, CRP can be
considered a perfect marker for assessment of systemic levels
of inflammation.

 

Recently CRP is being shown to be more than a mere indicator
of inflammation. Prospective epidemiological studies have
demonstrated that CRP level is a strong predictor of future
cardiovascular events'*! that most cases has been proved to
occur independently of age, smoking, cholesterol levels, blood
pressure, and diabetes. Possible mechanisms of cardiovascular
dysfunction with increased levels of CRP have been described:
CRP is found within atheromatous plaque, correlates with

vascular dysfunction, promotes secretion of inflammatory
mediators by vascular endothelium, has a direct role in cell
adhesion molecular expression, and opsonizes low density
lipoprotein for uptake by macrophages in the atherosclerotic
plaque." In addition, CRP is a powerful, independent risk
determinant of insulin resistance, a known risk factor for
cardiovascular disease.!"] Thus, CRP may be one of the
mediators of chronic systemic inflammation.

Namazi, et al.: HsCRP in moderate to severe acne vulgaris

The skin is the largest organ of the body, and the inflammatory
skin conditions have the potential to induce systemic
inflammation. However, little work has been done in this
important domain.

Psoriasis is one of the major dermatological disorders with
potential to involve a large surface area of the body. It also
may involve the articular system. Interestingly, patients with
psoriasis are at higher risk of cardiovascular disorders which
could be due to the effect of chronic systemic inflammation.
Even greater risk can be seen with involvement of joints.
Studies have shown that serum CRP levels in patients
are increased up to 20-fold during acute exacerbations of
psoriasis and decline after remission; however, levels remain
continuously elevated in comparison to the normal population.
Furthermore, CRP levels have a correlation with the extent of
the disease and could be used as a blood marker to evaluate
the severity of the disease.!'?14]

Another dermatologic disease with an increased level of CRP is
chronic ordinary urticaria. Studies have shown that circulating
levels of CRP and IL-6 are significantly elevated in chronic
urticaria patients, and these increases corresponded to the
severity and activity of the disease. Data suggests that there
is a systemic inflammatory reaction in chronic urticaria."

Studies have shown elevation of IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6,
IL-8, IL-10, TNF-a and IFN-y in the blister fluid of bullous
pemphigoid patients as compared to their serum levels.!'7"8
D’Auria et al., showed an increase serum levels of IL-6 and
TNF-c in BP patients. There was significant correlation between
serum levels of the aforementioned cytokines and disease
activity in terms of lesion count. Expectedly, the significant
correlation of serum IL-6 and CRP concentrations in this study
can clearly explain the observed increased level of CRP in BP
patients.!"9!

Inflammation is thought to contribute to the development
and progression of various cancers.” Study of Trichopoulos
et al., indicated that elevated plasma CRP level is a marker of
cancer risk in healthy individuals. They assessed cancer risk
of many organs and for the first time reported an association
of non-melanoma skin cancer with elevated plasma CRP.!")

In this study, we chose acne vulgaris because it is a very
common dermatologic disease affecting many young
individuals and in some cases, the involvement of skin can be
very severe with intense inflammation and disfiguring scars. In
addition, acne is a chronic disease which may last for a decade
or more after puberty.!772)

A similar dermatologic condition to acne vulgaris for which
CRP data is available is rosacea. One study showed that
CRP level in rosacea patients was clearly above that of

256

the control group (0.429 vs. 0.243 ug/l, P = 0.007). Only in
10% of patients was it above 0.8 ug/l. Interestingly there is
evidence that patients with rosacea may be at increased risk
of cardiovascular problems despite the fact that CRP is not
elevated above 1 g/I.'2°!

Complicated variants of acne that may report increased
levels of CRP such as acne fulminans, acne conglobata and
hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa) were excluded from
the present study.

Vergou et al., conducted a study to evaluate the correlation of
thyroid disorder with the presence of acne. They did not find any
significant statistical difference in the CRP levels between case
and control groups, although they found higher median levels of
CRP in the control group than in the acne group (0.8 t1g/ml vs.
0.57 ug/ml), similar to our findings (1.5 ,xg/ml vs. 0.6 tg/ml).!4)
While their study included adult women with post-adolescent
acne, our study included both male and female participants,
of both adolescent and adult age groups. In addition, our
study applied strict exclusion criteria in order to eliminate the
confounding effects of other possible elevators of CRP.

Other studies wherein CRP levels of acne patients were assessed
involved those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
Increased levels of CRP were reported in such studies:
Alemzadeh et al., reported a mean CRP level of 3.0 g/ml
and Keskin Kurt et a/., reported mean CRP level of 5.5 ug/ml
among participating PCOS patients.'*°75! In the present study,
we excluded cases of PCOS because our goal was to assess
the exclusive impact of acne-induced inflammation upon serum
levels of CRP, while in the PCOS there is a mixture of hormonal
imbalances and metabolic derangements that could exert
unknown, confounding effects upon the serum level of CRP.

Our data showed that the mean CRP level in the acne group
is 2.24 mg/l that is far higher than the result reported in the
rosacea study. Thus, one can infer that there is more severe
inflammation in the skin of acne patients than in those with
rosacea. Another finding in our study was that the mean
CRP level in severe acne group was higher than that of the
moderate acne group (3.006 vs 1.217 mg/l). The above data
potentiates the notion that Hs-CRP measurement is a practical
tool to assess the severity of cutaneous inflammation in acne.
In addition, 13.6% (3/22) of cases with moderate acne and
35% (7/20) of cases with severe acne had CRP levels of more
than 1 g/ml indicating possibly increased risk of cardiovascular
disease.

Given that the effect of local inflammation induced by acne
may induce very subtle changes in the CRP level as also the
presence of many factors that may influence the CRP level,
the importance of choosing an exactly matched control group
appears to be very critical and must be addressed with scrutiny.

Namazi, et al.: HsCRP in moderate to severe acne vulgaris

Therefore, choosing a control group comprising blood donors
could be one of the limitations of our study that could have
contributed to non-significant differences between the case
and control groups. Another limitation could be the lack of a
group of participants with mild acne that could have been used
as a matched control group for comparison with the moderate
to severe acne group.

Although the median CRP level in the severe inflammatory acne
group was clearly above the moderate inflammatory group in
our study, the lack of statistically difference between the severe
and moderate acne groups could be simply due to the small
number of cases in each group or the inappropriateness of the
acne severity classification. Accordingly, statistical calculations
based on the results of the present study propose a very large
number of cases and controls (around 750).

A large study involving adequate numbers of participants
with an exactly matched control group would be appropriate
to elucidate the effect of inflammatory acne on CRP levels.
Measuring other cytokines including IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-c. would
also be more informative. Delineating a serum marker for the
severity of acne can help dermatologists to assess the validity
of current acne severity scoring systems (more than 20) and
choose the most accurate one for everyday practice.
