Abstract

Background: Real-world evidence describing the benefits of recommended therapies and their impact on the quality of life (QoL) of chronic urticaria (CU) patients is
limited.

Objective: To investigate disease burden, current treatment schedule, and the use of
clinical resources by patients with H,-antihistamine-refractory CU in Europe.
Methods: AWARE (A World-wide Antihistamine-Refractory chronic urticaria patient
Evaluation) is a global, prospective, non-interventional study in the real-world setting, sponsored by the manufacturer of omalizumab. Disease characteristics, pharmacological treatments, and health-related QoL of patients (N = 2727) 218 years of
age diagnosed with H,-antihistamine-refractory chronic spontaneous urticaria (without inducible urticaria) for >2 months are reported here.

Results: Of the 2727 patients included, 1232 (45.2%) and 1278 (46.9%) were
successfully followed up for any assessment and for the key outcome, the urticaria control test (UCT) score, respectively, and patients with complete remission
(14.1%) were excluded from analyses.The proportion of patients with uncontrolled
CSU (UCT score <12) dropped from 78% (n/N = 1641/2104) at baseline to 28.7%
(n/N = 269/936) after two years of participation in the AWARE study. In addition,
the proportion of patients with no impact of CSU on their QoL (assessed by the
Dermatological Life Quality Index) increased to 57% (n/N = 664/1164) from 18.7%
(n/N = 491/2621) at baseline. Emergency room visits (2.4% [n/N = 7/296] vs 33.5%
[n/N = 779/2322]) and hospital stays (1.7% [n/N = 5/296] vs 24.2% [n/N = 561/2322])
reduced at Month 24 vs baseline. Overall, 23.2% (n/N = 26/112) patients on nonsedating H,-antihistamines (nsAH) and 41.9% (n/N = 44/105) patients on up-dosed
nsAH had uncontrolled CSU (UCT <12) at Month 24. In omalizumab-treated patients,
27.1% (n/N = 78/288) had uncontrolled CSU at Month 24.

Conclusion: These data confirm improvements for most patients with CSU over a
2-year follow-up period. Further studies are needed to understand the differences

between guideline recommendations and reported management.

1 | INTRODUCTION

Chronic urticaria (CU) is characterized by itching, burning or sometimes painful hives (wheals), and/or angioedema (swelling in the
deeper layers of the skin) for at least 6 weeks.’ The estimated
prevalence of CU varies from 0.1% in North America to 1.4% in the
Asian population.” In patients with CU, symptoms may occur spontaneously without a definite trigger, known as chronic spontaneous
urticaria (CSU), or in response to a specific trigger, known as chronic
inducible urticaria (CIndU).?* About 20% of CU patients may experience CSU and CindU concurrently.°

Chronic urticaria has a negative impact on the quality of life
(QoL) and hampers work productivity and daily activities.“® The
international guideline for urticaria (EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF/WAO)
recommends a stepwise treatment approach to improve symptom control and reduce disease burden among patients with CU."
Second-generation non-sedating H,-antihistamines (nsAH) at approved doses are the first-line therapy; however, up to 60% of patients do not respond adequately within 2-4 weeks of starting the
treatment and require increased doses (upto 4-fold of the licensed
dose), which is the second-line recommendation.” At the time
the AWARE study was initiated, the EAACI/GA7LEN/EDF/WAO
urticaria guideline recommended third-line add-on therapy with
ciclosporin, leukotriene receptor agonists such as montelukast, or
omalizumab, if no adequate response was achieved with higher than
standard doses of H,-antihistamines; however, this recommendation
was changed in the 2017 update and revision of this guideline.*?°
The 2017 guideline provides a strong recommendation for the use
of omalizumab as third-line add-on therapy to H,-antihistamines,
if no adequate response is observed after 2-4 weeks (or earlier if
symptoms are intolerable) of treatment with an up-dosed nsAH.
Patients who remain inadequately controlled with omalizumab after
6 months (or earlier if symptoms are intolerable) are recommended
to receive add-on therapy with ciclosporin A as a fourth-line agent
(off-label).

Real-world evidence on the benefits of the recommended
therapeutic medications and their impact on the QoL of CU patients in Europe is limited. Previous reports suggest that physicians show poor adherence to guidelines in the diagnosis and
therapeutic management of CSU leading to an unmet need in the
CU patient population."? Baseline findings of the AWARE study in
Europe revealed that CU is largely uncontrolled, undertreated, and
associated with a high healthcare resource use burden, and that
it has a large effect on QoL, work, and activity.!? Furthermore,
the majority of data on CU that is inadequately controlled with
H,-antihistamines are limited to patient populations derived from
specialized urticaria centres such as Urticaria Centers of Reference
and Excellence (UCAREs),!? which may not represent the general
CU population.**4* AWARE is a prospective, non-interventional
study that examines real-world treatment patterns, burden of disease, and rates of healthcare resource utilization of patients with
CU that is inadequately controlled with H,-antihistamines. Here,

we report any changes in the treatment regimen, symptoms, and

health-related QoL (HR-QoL) throughout the 2-year period of
the study with patients with CSU inadequately controlled by H,
antihistamines in 12 European countries.

2 | METHODS
2.1 | Patients and study design

AWARE was a multicentre, prospective, non-interventional study
that followed patients with CU for 2 years, who were inadequately
controlled with at least one approved dose of H,-antihistamine.*®
This report focuses on patients enrolled in urticaria centres and
office-based dermatological and allergological practices across 12
European countries (Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy,
Greece, Russia, France, Denmark, Belgium, Portugal, Norway, and
Sweden) at 418 sites between March 2014 and October 2015.
Patients were included if they had physician-confirmed CU for
at least 2 months with inadequate response to standard-doses of H,antihistamine treatment. Patients were also required to be 218 years
of age and be able to provide informed consent. Enrolled patients
were followed up for at least 2 years. Patients were excluded from
the study if urticaria was present for less than 2 months or due to
unanticipated difficulties in the follow-up of the patient in the 2-year
study period, or if they were simultaneously participating in any
other clinical CU study. All patients met the following criteria: fulfilment of all inclusion criteria, no violation of any exclusion criteria, written informed consent prior to study enrolment, and all core
baseline characteristics (gender, age, and diagnosis) available.
Although patients with ClndU were also included in the AWARE
study, this manuscript focuses on patients diagnosed with CSU (with
or without angioedema). The study protocol was approved by the
institutional review board of each participating centre. The trial was
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good
Clinical Practice (GCP) and in compliance with all federal, local, and
regional requirements. AWARE was sponsored by the manufacturer

of omalizumab.

2.2 | Patient-reported outcome measures

Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures were used to assess disease activity, to measure the impact on the QoL as recommended
by international guidelines and control CU.!° PROs included the
7-day Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7; weekly diary for disease activity),°?® Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI; questionnaire for
psychosocial effects of chronic skin disease),’? Chronic Urticaria
QoL Questionnaire (CU-Q,oL),7° Angioedema QoL Questionnaire
(AE-QoL),21? Urticaria Control Test (UCT; to assess urticaria control: UCT 212, poorly controlled disease: UCT <19) eet Work
Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI),2° and
monthly Angioedema Activity Score (AAS).2° Each patient was
observed for a period of 2 years. After the baseline visit (Visit 1),

3.1. | Demographics and clinical characteristics

Patient disposition and diagnostic groups are shown in Table 1. Of
the 3683 patients included in the analysis, 74.0% (n = 2727) had
only CSU, 5.3% (196) had only ClndU, and 20.6% (n = 760) had
concomitant CSU and ClndU. The mean + SD age of CSU patients
was 46.7 + 15.7 years, and 70.9% (n = 1933) of patients were female (Table 2). The mean + SD for total duration of disease was
4.7 +7.2 years. In all, 1589 (43.5%) patients discontinued the study.
Lost to follow-up (62.9%) of patients was the main reasons for discontinuation, followed by withdrawal of informed consent (20.3%)
and spontaneous remission of CU (14.1%). The total patients available for assessment at each visit are described in Table S1.

3.2 | Symptom control (wheals and angioedema)
after 2 years in AWARE

At baseline, 89.4% (n/N = 2419/2706) of CSU patients experienced
wheals (within the last 6 months before baseline). At Months 3 and
24, 74.3% (n/N = 1529/2058) and 47.5% (n/N = 589/1241) of patients reported wheals (in the 3 previous months), respectively
(Figure 1A). Correspondingly, the mean UAS7 score declined over
the study period from 17.5 (+12.4) (N = 589) at baseline to 4.5 (+7.5)
(N = 724) at Month 24.

At baseline, 45.0% (n/N = 1219/2706) of CSU patients experienced angioedema during the last 6 months; this decreased to 25.8%
(n/N = 526/2042) at month 3 and continued to improve across visits.
At Month 24, 13.1% (n/N = 162/1232) of CSU patients experienced
angioedema (Figure 1B). Substantial improvement in monthly mean
(+SD) AAS (baseline: 122.9 + 111.3 [N = 116], Month 24:83.1 + 110.9
[N = 42]) was observed (Figure 1D).

3.3 | Disease control after 2 years in AWARE
(UCT) at baseline, 78.0%

(n/N = 1641/2104) of patients had poorly controlled CSU (UCT <12).
At Month 3, 51.3% (n/N = 844/1645) had poorly controlled CSU

(Figure 1C) and, the UCT score improved over time, and at Month
24, 28.7% (n/N = 269/936) of CSU patients showed poor disease
control.

3.4 | HR-QoL over 2 years in AWARE

Baseline DLQI scores indicated that merely 18.7% (n/N = 491/2621)
of CSU patients experienced no impact on their QoL (DLQI band
O-1) (Figure 2A). This markedly improved over the 2-year study period: 50.3% (n/N = 773/1538) of patients reached this goal after
1 year and 57.0% (n/N = 664/1164) after 2 years. At Month 24,
18.5% (n/N = 216/1164) of CSU patients experienced moderate to
extremely large effect on their QoL compared to baseline (54.1%,
n/N = 1419/2621). Substantial improvement in mean (+SD) CUQ,oL (baseline: 35.1 + 20.2 [N = 1928], Month 24:16.3 + 16.1 points
[N = 824]) and AE-Qol (42.4 + 23.6 [N = 1178] to 22.7 + 19.7 points
[N = 409]) was seen (Figure 2B-C).

3.5 | Healthcare resource utilization over
2 years of treatment

Emergency room visits and hospital stays were frequent at baseline
and reduced at the end of the study: emergency room visits (33.5%,
n/N = 779/2322 at baseline down to 2.4%, n/N = 7/296 at Month
24) and hospital stays (24.2%, n/N = 561/2322 at baseline down to
1.7%, n/N = 5/296 at Month 24). General practitioners and additional
visits to dermatologists/allergists were seen for CSU symptoms by
65.0% (n/N = 1510/2322) and 53.1% (n/N = 1232/2322) patients
at baseline, respectively. At Month 24, 22.3% (n/N = 66/296) and
23.6% (n/N = 70/296) CSU patients were still consulting additional
general practitioners and dermatologists/allergists.

3.6 | Work productivity impairment over
2 years of treatment

Asubstantial improvement of total activity impairment measured by
the WPAI was seen from 32.5 + 30.1% [N = 2437] at baseline down
to 12.3 + 21.3% [N = 1069] at Month 24 in CSU patients. Similarly,
impairment of total work productivity improved from 26.7 + 27.5%
[N = 1321] down to 10.7 + 18.9% [N = 561] within 2 years. The
CSU-induced impairment while working (presenteeism) reduced
from 24.5 + 25.7% [N = 1331] at baseline to 9.4 + 17.4% [N = 562] at
Month 24. The mean (+ SD) percentage of work time missed (absenteeism) due to CSU was also reduced from 7.3 + 19.7% [N = 1360] to
2.1 + 10.0% [N = 714] at Month 24.

3.7 | Treatment pattern over 2 years in
AWARE study

With regard to medication groups, 17.3% (n/N = 473/2727) of CSU
patients were treated with approved doses of nsAH (Figure 3), and
23.2% (n/N = 26/112) of these patients had poorly controlled disease
(UCT < 12) at month 24. Overall, 22.3% (n/N = 609/2727) of CSU
patients used up-dosed nsAH (Figure 3), and 41.9% (n/N = 44/105)
of these patients had an uncontrolled form of the disease at Month
24. While 32.3% (n/N = 881/2727) of CSU patients were treated
with omalizumab (Figure 3), 27.1% (n/N = 78/288) of CSU patients
had uncontrolled disease at Month 24. Of 945 CSU patients who
received omalizumab during the study, only 34.4% (n = 325) continuously received the drug prior and during the course of study,
3.1% (n = 29) had only received prior treatment, and 18.3% (n = 173)
started treatment during the study (no prior treatment). 44.2% of

patients underwent other treatment schemes.

Other treatments, suchas ciclosporin and sedating antihistamines
(sAH), were rarely used, and none of them were prescribed in more
than 5% of patients (Figure 3). Interestingly, the non-recommended
use of “on-demand” nsAH increased from 3.1% (n/N = 85/2727) before enrolment to 12.8% (n/N = 163/1278) at Month 24. The number of patients on “no treatment” was small throughout the study
and decreased from 37.0% (n/N = 1008/2727) prior enrolment to
17.9% (n/N = 229/1278) at Month 24. As shown in Figure 4, the majority of the patients requiring treatment due to poorly controlled
disease at baseline, either continued to receive treatment with nsAH
or received no treatment at all during subsequent visits.

In some countries (Greece, Portugal, Belgium, Denmark, and
Norway), patients were frequently escalated to up-dosed nsAH (between 12.8% [n/N = 10/78] in Belgium and 22.0% [n/N = 11/50]
in Norway) and switched to third-line therapies at high rates (between 79.3% [n/N = 115/145] in Greece and 60.5% [n/N = 46/76]
in Portugal) (Figure 5). Non-recommended therapies, such as

CSU, chronic spontaneous urticaria. Other third-line treatment options (as defined in 2014 guidelines) were rarely used. Prior to AWARE
enrolment, ciclosporin was prescribed in 2.6% (n = 71) of patients, which reduced to 0.3% (n = 4) at the end of the observational period.
Similarly, montelukast was prescribed for 3.6% (n = 97) of patients with chronic urticaria before enrolment and prescriptions reduced to
1.9% (n = 24) at Month 24 (Figure 4). The non-recommended sedative antihistamines were similarly rarely prescribed, with 4.1% before

combination of nsAH and sAH, were rarely used and rates of patients reported as receiving “no treatment” were low to none.

In Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Sweden, patients
were frequently up-dosed to nsAH, but a substantial amount of
patients were either not up-dosed at all (Germany with 19.4%
[n/N = 431/2226]) or escalated to off-label third-line therapies
(montelukast: the United Kingdom 19.8% [n/N = 50/252] and
Sweden 35.7% [n/N = 10/28]). Escalation to omalizumab varied in
this group (United Kingdom 20.2% [n/N = 51/252], Sweden 25%
[n/N = 7/28], Germany 30.9% [n/N = 687/2226], and Spain 44.7%
[n/N = 122/273).

In France, Italy, and Russia, relatively high rates of patients remained on approved doses of nsAH, despite the fact that they were inadequately controlled with them, with levels of 23.9% [n/N = 22/92],
27.9% [n/N = 69/247], and 29.1% [n/N = 39/134], respectively.
Likewise, up-dosing of nsAH was observed less frequently, with
levels ranging between 14.1% [n/N = 13/92] in France and 17.4%
[n/N = 43/247] in Italy. Up-dosing to omalizumab occurred in only
14.2% [n/N = 19/134] (Russia) to 22.8% [n/N = 21/92] (France) of
cases. The use of montelukast varied between 4.0% [n/N = 10/247]
(Italy) and 20.9% [n/N = 28/134] (Russia). Additionally, the non-recommended combination of nsAH and sAH was chosen in 4.3%
[n/N = 4/92] (France) up to 12.6% [n/N = 31/247] (Italy) of patients.

4 | DISCUSSION
The present study aims to prospectively collect real-world data to
evaluate disease burden and treatment in CU patients inadequately
treated with H1-antihistamine. The 2-year results from AWARE in
Europe confirm that CSU remains undertreated. The baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of patients with CSU documented in the study, in general, are similar to the patient population
included in omalizumab clinical trials.2”?” Concomitant angioedema
was reported in almost half of enrolled CU patients within the last six
months. At baseline, 89.4% and 45% of patients reported hives and
angioedema, respectively. Although there was improvement in the
disease condition over time, a substantial proportion of patients continued to have hives and/or angioedema after 2 years. Angioedema
plays a significant role in the burden of CSU, with a negative impact
on HR-QoL and is known to drive direct costs.° The frequency of
CSU with comorbid ClndU has not been well-documented to date;
however, in this broad observational study, the rate of comorbid
ClndU in these patients with CSU inadequately controlled with H,antihistamines was 20.6%."

At baseline, patients with CSU were undertreated and had high
medical resource utilization. Also, 4 of 5 patients had poorly controlled CSU (UCT <12). Nearly 55% of CU patients had at least a

moderate, large, or extremely large impact on their QoL. The CUQ,oL score at baseline confirmed a moderate to high impact of urticaria on patients’ QoL.

The most frequent medications reported prior enrolment were
CU guideline-recommended nsAHs. According to the 2014 urticaria
guidelines established at the time of the AWARE study,,° patients
not responding to first-line (approved dose of nsAH) and second-line
treatment (up-dosed nsAH) were to be prescribed third-line add-on
therapy with omalizumab, montelukast, or ciclosporin. Since individual CSU patients differ in their responses to the recommended
treatment algorithm, the focus of the present study was to evaluate the proportion of patients in different treatment groups and
their corresponding UCT scores where available. Patients improved
substantially over the 2-year observational period as evident by all
investigated objectives, with more than 70% of patients with CSU
achieving symptom control. A substantial proportion of patients
had poorly controlled CSU after the two-year period, and after
being seen by a specialist. As with a previous observational study by
Curto-Barredo et al? where 32.4% and 17.3% of patients with CSU
required medical care after 3 and 5 years, respectively, this AWARE
study shows the necessity of long-term medical case in CSU.

The burden of CSU on HR-QoL was evident from PROs with high
DLQI and CU-Q,oL scores. Despite treatment and expert care, about
one in five patients had moderate to extremely large effects on their
HR-QolL after 2 years. Our results are in agreement with previous studies showing that CSU has a significant impact on QoL of patients, with
a high rate of emotional burden and psychiatric comorbidities.°°°*
Unsurprisingly, for a 2-year observation period, CSU patients showed
high medical resource utilization, with multiple dermatologists and
general practitioners being involved with patient care.

Our results show that many patients after two years of expert
care, either receive treatment that does not help them control
their urticaria or receive no treatment at all. In this study, 23.2%
of patients with CSU who remained uncontrolled (UCT < 12) with
nsAH should ideally have at least received up-dosed nsAH in an
attempt to improve symptoms. Similarly, 41.9% of patients whose
symptoms were uncontrolled with up-dosed nsAH should have
received further escalation to a third-line treatment option. Such
differences in treatments may be attributed to clinicians who do
not always follow urticaria treatment guidelines and may require
better acceptance of the guidelines for treatment.°°°” A webbased survey of patients diagnosed with CU in Germany revealed
that only 40% of symptomatic patients were under physician care,
with the majority of them choosing to stop their consultations, as
they felt doctors were unable to help them or that they knew how
to treat the CU symptoms themselves.°° Similar results on survey
of patients were reported in Italy.°°> The guidelines recommend
omalizumab as an add-on treatment (to H,-antihistamines) and
upon de-escalation patients should stop omalizumab and continue
H,-antihistamines; however, there appears to be a persistence of
omalizumab use in patients with withdrawal of other treatments.
Omalizumab is shown to be safe and effective across randomized

placebo-controlled trials’ and several real-world studies,

with a total patient exposure of 1,328,183 patient years (Novartis
data on file, Dec 2019).

The strength of this study as a reflection of real-world practice is also its main limitation. There were no pre-defined or randomized group assessments of patients, instead data describing
the treatment strategy of a patient were assessed on an ongoing
basis and could also vary during the study. The only inclusion criteria applied, next to the patient providing informed consent and
age 218 years, were a medically confirmed diagnosis of CU with
symptoms of more than 2 months and inadequate control with H,antihistamines. No explicit exclusion criteria apart from anticipated
difficulties in the follow-up of the patient and simultaneous participation in any other clinical urticaria trial were applied. Number
of patients available for assessment decreased over 2 years primarily due to loss of follow-up. The calculation of percentages
was based on the valid data per parameter, excluding patients
with missing values. Patients with complete remission of urticaria
(14.1%) were also excluded from the analysis. Additional factors
yielding a selection bias of patients cannot be completely ruled
out. The observed frequent lack of treatment escalation might
be related to variability in prescription practices across European
countries, cost and/or availability of treatment, or tolerability issues—the present study did not systematically collect safety and
tolerability data; therefore, these factors cannot be excluded. The
European countries included in this study have unique healthcare
systems and currently not all guideline-recommended therapies
are available; for instance, omalizumab was not available in the UK
during the study period or affordable for all patients with CSU.
For example, certain countries experience specific reimbursement
constraints that make it mandatory to stop third-line treatment
(omalizumab) after a certain period of time. The countries may also
have local guidelines that can differ from EAACI/GA7LEN/EDF/
WAO guidelines. In addition, it is also likely that health economic
factors in different countries might affect prescription practices.
When interpreting subgroup analyses by country, it has to be
considered that patient numbers per country varied significantly:
from 28 patients in Sweden up to 2226 patients in Germany. The
data obtained within this study were assessed using descriptive
statistics and were not used for comparative analysis.

The present data from a large patient population likely reflect the
disease burden and treatment regimens of CU patients in Europe. The
enormous variability observed in data reflecting healthcare utilization
and treatment strategies between countries maybe seen as a result of
different healthcare systems and health economic standards of participating countries. There is a need for improved patient care, physician
education, and adherence to treatment guidelines for better management of CU. Further studies are needed to understand the differences

between guideline recommendations and reported management.
