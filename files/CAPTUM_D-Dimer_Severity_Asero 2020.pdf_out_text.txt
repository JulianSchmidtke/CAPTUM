ABSTRACT

In patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), low dose omalizumab maintenance therapy is
effective in about one half of complete, fast responders to the drug. Omalizumab 150 mg/month was given
as maintenance therapy to 21 patients with a history of severe CSU showing a complete (UAS7= 0)
response to the dose of 300 mg/month. After 2 months of such regimen, patients were divided into
controlled (n= 14; UAS7= 0) and not controlled (n= 7; UAS7 > 10) and ESR, CRP, total IgE, and D-din er vere
measured. The two groups did not differ in any of the biomarkers considered, nor in disez se ‘u. >tiun or in
pre-treatment UAS7 score. The study confirms that it is possible to halve the dose of ©. 1aliz imab without
any loss of efficacy in a subgroup of patients with CSU but that none of the curre. tly 2ailable biomarkers is

able to predict which patients will lose disease control following omalizurr ib a se reduction.
INTRODUCTION

Omalizumab has become an essential part of the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). In
patients with severe disease that are unresponsive to antihistamine treatment at any dosage, omalizumab
at a monthly dose of 300 mg has been recommended as a safe and effective third line treatment (1).
Omalizumab induces a rapid drop in UAS7 levels in about 70% of cases (the so-called fast responders) an¥a
slower but equally good response over 3-4 months in further 15% of patients (slow responders); ir ce..*rast

the remaining 15% seem refractory to the treatment (2).

Due to the current national Regulatory Agency (AIFA) rules, in Italy it is not possihle tz tr. at CSU patients
with omalizumab for > 1 year (11 administrations are licensed in total: a first cours. or 6 monthly 300 mg
doses followed by 5 further doses after a stop of no less than 2 months in cose of relapse) with no
possibility to resume the treatment in case of further relapses (3). 111.> s.tuation has prompted to look for
alternative therapeutic strategies aiming to prolong the dv ration of the treatment as much as possible.
Recently, this allergy center belonging to the GAZLEN- 2 74°5 network proposed to pursue omalizumab
treatment at the reduced dosage of 150 mg/mo7*h << maintenance in patients who had shown a complete
response to the drug (i.e., UAS7 = 0) at 30€ mg/mv nth (4). In that study, about one-half of the patients
undergoing this regimen showed ar cn, air g excellent response, while in the other half the dose appeared
to be insufficient and sympton s <«. rted again, albeit with lesser intensity than before the start of
omalizumab treatment /4). .. recent years several biomarkers have been detected for chronic spontaneous
urticaria: some, lik2 L di.er plasma levels, are associated with a severe disease (5) that is unresponsive to
antihistamine \95), \vhile others such as total IgE are predictive of the response to omalizumab (7-9). In the
present su ‘ay these and other biomarkers were measured and compared in two subgroups of CSU patients
re_nonuing differently to omalizumab 150 mg/month as maintenance treatment with the aim to investigate

‘heir prognostic value.
PATIENTS AND METHODS

Twenty-one patients (M/F 7/14; mean age 49.4 years, median 51 years) with severe CSU (baseline UAS7 >
30) were enrolled. All of them had shown a rapid and complete (UAS7= 0) response to Omalizumab at the
dose of 300 mg/month. After an informed written consent was obtained, the maintenance dosage of the
drug during the second course of treatment was halved (i.e., 150 mg/month were given) in order to pic'on,g
the therapy period. ESR, CRP, plasma D-dimer, and total IgE were measured after two months ¢< the
reduced dose regimen. Based on their clinical response, patients were classified as fully con.~oi.2d (i.e.,
persistence of UAS7= 0) or insufficiently controlled (appearance of wheals with o. v iti. xu. angioedema; i.e.,

UAS7 > 10). Disease duration in months and thyroid autoimmunity were consic>rec as well.

Clinical results compared by chi-square test with Yates’ correction. Pr- ability values less than 5% were

considered statistically significant.
RESULTS

Table 1 shows the clinical findings in the study population. Fourteen patients continued to show a complete
control of the disease despite the dose reduction of omalizumab, whereas 7 showed a relapse of the
disease whose severity did nonetheless never reach the levels preceding the start of omalizumab
treatment. The two subgroups did not show any difference in any of the analyzed parameters. A maricd
increase in total IgE from baseline levels was recorded in all patients; in contrast, D-dimer plasria le\ >'s had
dropped to normal levels in 19/21 patients and to borderline levels in the remaining two. Es? avd CRP were
normal in virtually all cases. The prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity was similat ‘n cnv tv.v groups as was
the disease duration and the severity of the disease at the start of omalizumak tree.ment. Full blood counts
showed a reduced number of basophils (basopenia) in all cases before the bozinning of omalizumab

treatment (first course) but were not controlled again after th: st irt c* tne treatment.
DISCUSSION

Previous studies showed that D-dimer plasma levels are elevated in in a proportion of patients with chronic
spontaneous urticaria and decrease dramatically according to the clinical response to treatment (10). This
study fully confirmed this finding, as in all patients showing very elevated D-dimer plasma levels before
starting anti-lgE treatment D-dimer dropped within the normal range during the treatment. Theoretica.'v it
was conceivable that in some patients the loss of clinical control was associated with an increase in .-aimer
levels (10) but this event did not occur, possibly because these patients were in effect omahoun ab

responders (albeit undertreated) and did not develop any resistance to the drug \17.).

Total IgE baseline levels are frequently slightly elevated in patients with CSI’, >sp ><ially in those who
respond promptly to omalizumab (7-9). Omalizumab administration e. entual, leads to an increase in total
IgE levels while reducing their free fraction due to the prolong. io.» of -heir half-life, and such increase may
last for more than one year after stopping the treatment 12, Since fast omalizumab responders
represented the whole population enrolled in the stu 4, it is not surprising that total IgE levels were
frequently elevated before omalizumab treatn.2nt . nd increased in all cases under anti-IgE therapy.
Theoretically, it could be hypothesized “::at >><1ents whose disease was no longer controlled by 150
mg/month of omalizumab showed 4igh 2>r mean total IgE levels than persistent full responders but, again,
this was not the case, possibly b suse total IgE that are measured in serum reflect only partially the IgE
fraction bound to cffe tor . ells. Finally, that blood basophils count is inversely related with disease activity
is well known (22). “his was observed also here, as all patients showed basopenia when omalizumab
treatment “1s started. Unfortunately, since circulating basophils numbers were not re-measured during
the tve.*™ent with anti-lgE, whether patients not responding or responding to 150 mg of Omalizumab as

".,incenance therapy showed differenced in basophils counts remains unclear.

Thus, the present study confirms that it is possible to halve the dose of Omalizumab without any loss of
efficacy in a large subgroup of CSU patients showing an excellent response to the full dose of the drug but
also shows that none of the currently available biomarkers of efficacy or severity is able to predict which

patients will lose the control of the disease following omalizumab dose reduction.
