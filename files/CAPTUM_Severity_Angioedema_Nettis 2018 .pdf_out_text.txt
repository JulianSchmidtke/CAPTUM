Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in elderly (aged >65 years) patients with
nonsedating Hi-antihistamine-refractory CSU in a real-life setting.
Methods: Patients with nonsedating H;-antihistamine-refractory CSU (n= 322) treated with omalizumab
administered every 4 weeks in doses of 300 mg for 24 weeks were divided into 2 groups according to age
at omalizumab treatment onset: 15 to 64 years and 65 years or older. Treatment response was assessed using
a 7-day urticaria activity score (UAS7). Adverse effects of omalizumab therapy were recorded.
Results: Among patients, 32 (9.9%) were 65 years or older. At baseline, CSU characteristics were generally
similar among the groups, although the presence of angioedema was statistically significantly lower in patients younger than 65 years. Any differences in weekly itch severity score, hive score, and UAS7 between
the 2 age groups were not significant at weeks 4, 12, and 24, with the exception of the hive score at 24 weeks
and the UAS7 at week 24. No significant between-group differences were seen in the proportion of patients
with a UAS7 of 6 or lower and with a UAS7 score of 0 at weeks 4, 12, 24, and 40. The proportion of patients
with at least one adverse event reported as suspected to be caused by study drug was 10% in the younger
group vs 6.3% in the older group (P=.53).
Conclusion: Our study found that omalizumab is a well-tolerated and effective therapy for elderly patients
with nonsedating H,-antihistamine-refractory CSU.

Introduction estimated 0.5% to 1% of the general population has this disease at
any time in their life.* Although the duration of CSU can extend to
5 years in 14% of patients,’ generally its duration is between 1 and
5 years.

First-line treatment of CSU is based on approved doses of
nonsedating, second-generation antihistamines (H;), and dose
levels can be increased 4-fold if required.° Unfortunately, a significant proportion of patients have poorly controlled CSU even with
medical treatment, and alternative therapeutic approaches therefore require consideration. Several immune modulator treatments
(prednisolone, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine,

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common skin disease
defined as spontaneous recurrent wheals or angioedema with a duration of at least 6 weeks. The disease is not fatal but is associated
with psychiatric morbidity and is responsible for a reduction in patients’ quality of life.'* Although the peak incidence of CSU occurs
between 20 and 40 years of age, all age groups can be affected. An

Immunology.’ The exact mechanism of action of omalizumab in CSU
is unknown, although it is hypothesized that omalizumab binds to
free circulating IgE, blocking action to target cells.’

Efficacy and safety of omalizumab in CSU have been established in several randomized, placebo-controlled trials*-'? and
confirmed in real-life studies.'**! The specific challenges in the treatment of patients with CSU who are 65 years or older differ
significantly from those who are younger. These elderly CSU patients with CSU in fact may have age-related comorbidities that
normally require multiple pharmaceutical treatments. Multiple longterm conditions (eg, osteoarthritis, hypertension, kidney failure, type
2 diabetes), age-related immunocellular senescence, and physical
and cognitive decline all pose a challenge for effective treatment
of CSU in those 65 years or older.” Polypharmacotherapy implies
drug interactions that may cause drug safety problems.” Furthermore, patients older than 65 years are particularly vulnerable to the
adverse effects of prolonged exposure to first-generation
H-antihistamines (sedation), glucocorticoids (osteoporosis), and
cyclosporine (hypertension)—all drugs usually recommended for CSU
therapy. Patients 65 years and older are frequently excluded from
clinical trials; therefore, evidence of the efficacy and safety of symptomatic therapy in this target group with CSU is scarce. Accordingly,
the safety and efficacy of omalizumab in patients with CSU older
than 65 years is still unknown.

In view of these findings, the aim of this study was to evaluate
the efficacy and safety of recommended treatment regimens
of omalizumab in patients older than 65 years affected by
H,-antihistamine-refractory CSU.

 

 

Methods
Patient Population and Study Design

Twenty-three secondary care centers belonging to a task force
of the Italian Society of Allergy, Asthma and Clinical Immunology
were involved in this observational, retrospective study from
September 2015 to August 2017. The study comprised a 4-week pretreatment period, a 24-week first treatment period, and a 16week follow-up period. The study protocol was approved by the
ethics committee of Naples University Hospital. Informed written
consent was obtained from all participants.

To be part of this observational study, each center was asked to
provide data for patients with refractory CSU, defined as having a
history of spontaneous urticaria for more than 6 weeks not responding to treatment for at least 4 weeks with the licensed dosage
of nonsedating second-generation H,-antihistamines and with a daily
urticaria activity score (UAS) of 4 or more assessed in clinic on one
of the pretreatment checkup days (days -14, -7, or 1) and a 7-day
urticaria activity score (UAS7) greater than 16 in the 7 days before
the first treatment. UAS7 is a widely used patient-reported CSU
measure, capturing intensity of pruritus and number of hives. Daily
itch severity score (range, 0 [none] to 3 [severe]) and number of
hives rating (range, 0 [none] to 3 [ > 50 hives]) are summed to create
a daily UAS score (range, 0-6 points per day).? However, most of
our patients had remained symptomatic before the start of the
present study despite treatment with H,-antihistamines at up to
4 times the approved dose and/or leukotreine receptor antagonists and/or systemic glucocorticoids and/or cyclosporine. An
autologous serum skin test” to assess for possible antibodies against
Fce receptor o-subunit was performed in all patients during active
disease. Total serum IgE was measured by immunofluorometric assay
(ImmunoCAP; ThermoFisher, Uppsala, Sweden), according to the
manufacturer's instructions.

According to the recommendations of the Italian Drug Agency
for CSU,4 omalizumab was administered subcutaneously every 4
weeks in doses of 300 mg for 24 weeks in total (first treatment

 

course) and was administered again (second treatment course) at
least 8 weeks after the end of the first treatment course if the UAS7
score showed values similar to those at pretreatment stage. Participants were required to maintain stable doses of their
pretreatment therapy with H,-antihistamines at approved doses
throughout the study period. During this time, patients were allowed
to take H;-antihistamines at up 4 times the approved dose and/or
systemic glucocorticoids as needed for symptom relief.

Baseline characteristics, including sex, age, total IgE value, antithyroid autoantibodies, autologous serum skin test result, duration
of CSU symptoms, history of angioedema, and type of medication,
were collected before the start of omalizumab treatment. Recruited patients were divided into 2 age groups: 18 to 64 years and
65 years or older.

The key efficacy end point was the differences between the 2
age groups in change in UAS7 score, weekly itch severity score (ISS),
and hive score at weeks 4, 12, and 24. Another primary objective
of the study was to evaluate the safety of omalizumab in patients
younger than 65 years compared with those 65 years or older.

Key secondary efficacy outcomes evaluated included the following: change of UAS7 score, weekly ISS, and hive score from
baseline to week 4, 12, and 24 in the 2 age groups; differences
between the 2 age groups in terms of proportion of patients with
well-controlled urticaria (UAS <6), and proportion of patients with
complete response (UAS7 = 0) at weeks 4, 12, 24, and 40. Drug safety
across the 24-week treatment period was evaluated in the 2 age
groups by recording and monitoring the frequency and severity of
adverse events (AEs).

Statistical Analysis

Comparisons of baseline categories were performed by the x?
(comparison of proportions) test and z test (comparison of means).
Comparisons of health outcomes at different intervals by age group
were performed with the Wilcoxon nonparametric test and the t
test for comparison of means. A multivariable linear regression model
was fitted to investigate the simultaneous effect of age (265 vs <65
years) sex (male vs female), and participating center on hive score,
ISS, and UAS7 at 4, 12, and 24 weeks, respectively. The level of significance was set at P<.05. Missing values were excluded, and
complete case analysis was performed. The statistical analysis was
conducted with the STATA 14 package (StataCorp, College Station,
Texas).

Results

A total of 322 patients with refractory CSU (mean [SD] age, 46.5
[14.3] years; median age, 46.5 years; age range, 15-83 years) received at least one dose of omalizumab and were examined by 56
different physicians. Two hundred ninety patients were between
15 and 64 years old (90.1% of the entire study group; mean [SD]
baseline UAS7, 27.9 [8.2]) and 32 were 65 years or older (9.9% of
all patients; mean [SD] baseline UAS7, 28.3 [9.5]). Nineteen patients (5.9%) discontinued treatment before the end of the 24week study: 17 (5.9%) in the younger group vs 2 (6.2%) in the older
group. Table 1 compares baseline values among the 2 different age
groups. As it can be seen, CSU characteristics were generally similar
between the 2 age groups at baseline, although the presence of angioedema was significantly lower in patients younger than 65 years
(33.7% vs 60%, P= .004). The use of H;-antihistamines at high dosage,
total IgE level, and thyroid autoantibody test positivity were slightly
higher in the younger group, whereas the duration of CSU, history
of angioedema, and UAS7 were slightly higher in the older group.

The mean change in UAS7 showed a decrease from baseline to
week 24 in the 2 age groups (Table 2). Both age bands experienced a reduction of UAS7 scores of 19.5 points from baseline to

week 4, a decrease of 22.6 points (for those aged <65 years) and
23.2 points (for those aged >65 years) to week 12, and a reduction
of 24.4 points (in patients aged <65 years) and 26.3 points (in patients aged >65 years) to week 24. As with the primary efficacy
outcome, similar results were observed for ISS and hive scores
(Table 2). In patients in the younger age group, the mean weekly
ISS decreased by 9.7, 11.5, and 12.2 points from baseline to week
4, 12, and 24, respectively; among those in the older age group, it
reduced by 10.1, 12.1, and 13.3 points in the same intervals. The mean
changes of hive score from baseline to week 4, 12, and 24 were -9.4,
-11.1, and -11.9 points respectively for patients younger than 65
years and -9.1, -11, and -12.8 points in the same intervals for
patients 65 years or older. Table 3 reports that all differences in
scores (weekly ISS, hive, and UAS7) between the 2 age groups were
not significant after controlling for the simultaneous effect of sex
and participating center, except for the hive score at 24 weeks
(regression coefficient, -1.5; 95% CI, -2.7 to -0.2).

There was no evidence of a difference between the 2 age groups
(<65 vs >65 years) with respect to the proportion of patients with
aUAS7 of 6 or less at week 4 (57.2% vs 68.7%; P=.21), week 12 (72.9%
vs 78.1%; P=.52), week 24 (84.2% vs 83.3%; P=.90), and week 40
(62.0% vs 60.0%; P=.88). Likewise, no significant differences in the
percentage of patients free of both hives and itching (ie, UAS7 = 0)
were observed in patients younger than 65 years when compared
with those 65 years or older at week 4 (38.3% vs 37.6%; P=.93), week

12 (53.2% vs 62.5%; P=.32), week 24 (67.8% vs 56.7%; P=.22), and
week 40 (44.3% vs 33.3%; P=.41).

Between weeks 24 and 40, the mean UAS7 in most patients gradually increased; therefore, 119 patients (104 aged <65 years and 15
aged 265 years) were re-treated with omalizumab. At week 40, 173
patients remained without restarting treatment (158 aged <65 years
and 15 aged 265 years).

Safety

During the 24-week treatment period, the proportion of patients with at least one AE potentially attributable to omalizumab
was 10% in those younger than 65 years and 6.2% among those 65
years or older (P=.53). Nineteen patients discontinued treatment
before the end of the 24-week study. Of the patients who discontinued the study, 12 had disease progression (11 in the younger age
group and 1 in the older age group), 2 patients (0.6%) in the younger
group experienced AEs (rash and administration-site conditions),
2 were lost to follow-up (in the younger age group), and 3 had personal problems (2 in the younger age group and 1 in the older group).
The overall incidence of AEs during treatment was 11.7% in the
younger age group compared with 6.2% in the older group (P=.35).
Migraine, asthenia, and administration-site conditions were the most
common AEs (Table 4). No treatment-emergent AEs were observed.

Discussion

Drug therapy is essential in caring for patients 65 years or older.
These patients often receive several medications because they
are frequently affected by several conditions and comorbidities. Unfortunately, polypharmacy positively correlates with an increased
risk of adverse drug reactions and drug-drug and drug-disease
interactions.”°

In addition, polypharmacy can increase the risk of low treatment adherence and, as a consequence, suboptimal therapeutic
effectiveness and poor clinical response. Furthermore, the aging
process may interfere with pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, resulting in different treatment responses.”° The present
study found that omalizumab is as effective and safe in patients with
refractory CSU who are 65 years or older as it is in those younger
than 65 years. No significant differences between the 2 age groups
were detected in the change from baseline to weeks 4, 12, and 24

(primary end point) in UAS7 score, weekly ISS, and hive score with
the exception of a significantly greater difference in hive scores at
week 24 in patients older than 65 years compared with the younger
age group. Clinically meaningful effects were observed for both age
groups in all other efficacy end points, with a similar magnitude
in the reduction of symptoms. In fact, almost identical percentages of patients with well-controlled urticaria and with complete
symptom control were homogeneously distributed between the 2
age groups throughout the 40 weeks of our study.

A systematic review and GRADE assessment”’ as well as a metaanalysis (7 randomized, placebo-controlled studies with 1,312
patients with CSU)** have provided further evidence to support the
efficacy and safety of omalizumab (300 mg every 4 weeks) in patients with CSU. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first
to assess the effects of omalizumab treatment in patients 65 years
or older in real-life conditions. Previous studies have considered
much smaller numbers of patients in this age group. For example,
in 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials, omalizumab treatment was studied in 6.2% (15 of 243),!° 4.2% (10 of 238),'? and 6.8%
(3 of 44)" of patients 65 years or older, without comparison with
patients younger than 65 years (control group). A few real-life studies
on the use of omalizumab in patients with CSU have considered patients aged 64 to 82 years, followed-up for a longer duration than
that of randomized clinical trials, providing useful indications for
clinical practice.'*-° In 2 long-term, real-life studies, omalizumab
proved to be safe and effective in the management of patients older
than 64 years with severe allergic asthma?® and improved health
outcomes in 31 patients 65 years or older with uncontrolled severe
asthma compared with those in younger age brackets.*° Nevertheless, in the latter study, omalizumab had a reduced effect among
those older than 64 years relative to younger patients with asthma.

In the present study, health improvement was significantly
greater only at week 24 in patients younger than 65 years relative
to the older age group, and it was limited to hive scores and UAS7
score. Such a tendency (a lower response to omalizumab treatment in those 65 years or older) might be explained by the presence
of angioedema at baseline, which was significantly higher in patients older than 65 years. In fact, this decreased response to
omalizumab treatment among patients with CSU and angioedema has already been reported.! Other clinical features, including
demographic data, abnormal laboratory findings, and medication
history of patients with CSU, were not significantly different between
the 2 age groups in our study, a similar finding to that of other
authors.”° Furthermore, in this study, omalizumab was well tolerated, as previously described.,**! Frequency (11.2%) and severity of
AEs probably attributable to the study drug observed in all patients were similar to those in 3 phase 3 clinical CSU trials, in which
the percentages of AEs presumably attributable to the study drug
were 11.1%,'' 9%,'° and 17.3%,’ irrespective of age in the 300 mg
of omalizumab groups and, in many aspects, comparable with patients receiving placebo. Furthermore, in our study, there was a
statistically nonsignificant tendency for better tolerability to treatment among the population of patients in the older age group
compared with the younger group (11.7% vs 6.2%). In the older group,
headache and transient injection-site reaction were reported and
no patient discontinued the treatment. The good safety profile of
omalizumab in patients older than 65 years importantly implies that
dose adjustment of this drug is not recommended in case of impaired renal or hepatic function and no dose change seems necessary
in older patients.?*

Limitations of this study include the relatively small sample size
of patients older than 64 years and the limited availability of
omalizumab as long-term treatment for CSU in Italy. Since the study
patients were not selected for this study, because all available patients with CSU managed with omalizumab were retrospectively
recruited from each participating center, the issue of selection bias

 

is not applicable to this study. Despite the observational study design,
with comparisons of health indicators made between subsets from
the same patient population, this study reflects real-life clinical
conditions.

In conclusion, the present study specifically focused on patients 65 years or older with refractory CSU, and reported for the
first time in a real-life situation that treatment with omalizumab
is effective and well tolerated. Large clinical trials with a similar refractory population are warranted to confirm our findings.
