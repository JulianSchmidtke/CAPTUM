Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a popular disease, affects patients’ life. Its etiologic agents are
not well known so; treatment of the patients is difficult. CD203c is a marker that is only present on
basophils. Statins are drugs used to lower cholesterol. Nowadays, it is well known that they have
immunomodulatory effects. This study evaluated the efficacy of a statin, atorvastatin, in combination with
antihistamines in treating CSU patients. Forty CSU patients were divided equally into two groups. The
first group was treated with antihistamines and atorvastatin, while the second group was treated with
antihistamines and placebo. Both groups received the treatment for three months. The effect of treatment
on total severity score (TSS), autologous serum skin test (ASST), basophil histamine release (BHR)
assay, in vivo basophil CD203c expression (%) and basophil activation test (BAT-CD203c) was assessed.
We found statistically significant reduction in TSS, BHR assay, in vivo basophil CD203c expression (%)
(P= 0.000 each), diameter of ASST and BAT-CD203c (P= 0.002, 0.017, respectively), in the patients that
received the atorvastatin and antihistamines. In conclusion, atorvastatin is effective in treating CSU
patients.

activation markers that is

hronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU)

is a common disease manifested by

wheals that occur for more than six
weeks, caused by different causes, these
include: physical stimuli, medications,
bacterial, viral and fungal infections and
some autoimmune pathways [1]. However,
the real etiological agent is still not
confirmed despite of the extensive wide
investigations [2].

Nowadays, some patients may have
autoimmune origin identified by the
presence of circulating antibodies against
both the immunoglobulin E receptor and
immunoglobulin E itself. This group of
patients represents the most severe form of
chronic urticaria [2]. The activation markers
on basophils are used as indicators to
evaluate the extent of cellular activation in
atopic diseases and also in chronic idiopathic
urticaria. CD203c is one of the basophil

selectively
expressed on the basophil /mastocyte lineage
[3].

The classic therapy for this disease is
taking antihistamines with increasing the
dose of the drug up to four folds. This
treatment is usually enough to control the
symptoms. But varied percent of patients,
5% - 50%, do not show any improvement on
this therapy [4]. So, the need for shift to
newer options for therapy to overcome this
unresponsiveness to regular treatment
becomes urgent [5].

Atorvastatin, one of statins, is a
cholesterol lowering drugs that has
immunomodulatory and anti-basophil effect
[2]. Previous studies reported the efficiency
of different types of statins, including
atorvastatin, in inhibiting the growth and
activation of human basophils [6], human
mast cells, and various cytokines including
IL-1, IL-2, IL-6 and IFN by human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells [7].
Therefore, our study aimed to evaluates
the efficacy of atorvastatin in combination
with antihistamines in treating CSU patients
by measuring some clinical and laboratory
parameters before and after treatment.

Patients and Methods
Study design and patient selection

This randomized, single blinded, controlled
clinical trial study was conducted at Allergy

and Immunology Unit in Medical Microbiology &
Immunology Department Faculty of Medicine,
Zagazig University, Egypt, from May 2014 to March
2015.

The study included 40 participants diagnosed as
CSU which was defined by recurrent attacks of
wheals with or without angioedema for more than six
weeks without clear cause. Patients were excluded if
they were suffering from other types of allergy, or
major medical disease e.g.: diabetes, hypertension,
chronic liver disease and chronic renal disease, or had
known causes of urticaria. Patients on
immunosuppressive therapy or systemic
corticosteroids for long duration, pregnant and breastfeeding patients were also excluded from the study.

We randomly assigned the participants into two
groups. The patients’ group included 20 CSU
patients, and treated by antihistamines and statins,
Ator 40 mg (Atorvastatin, Eipico), orally twice daily.
The control group included 20 CSU patients treated
by antihistamines and placebo (Vitamin E 400mg,
Pharco, Egypt), that contained un-effective material,
orally twice daily. Both groups received H1 blocker
antihistamines, Telfast 180 mg (Fexofenadine,
Sanofi-aventis Co, USA) orally twice daily beside
Ranitidine 150 mg as H2 blocker (MUP, Iran) orally
twice daily. This regimen of treatment was applied
according to Pezeshkpoor et al., [2].

 

All 40 patients were evaluated before starting this
regimen of treatment and 3 months after finishing it.
The primary efficacy outcomes were measuring the
change in total severity score (TSS) and autologous
serum skin test (ASST) while basophil histamine
release (BHR), in vivo CD203c expression and
basophil activation test-CD203c (BAT-CD203c) were
considered as secondary outcomes.

Role of Atorvastatin in Treatment of CSU Patients

Routine laboratory investigations

All participants were investigated to detect possible
causes of urticaria by CBC, stool analysis, urine
analysis, anti-Helicobacter pylori antibodies, ALT,
AST, creatinine, uric acid, TSH, ANA, total IgE,
antithyroid antibodies and Intradermal skin test

Total severity Score

Thorough clinical examination was conducted to all
patients to assess size, number of wheals, allocation
of wheals (limbs, trunk, hand, foot and face) and
severity of itching. Six parameters of disease activity
and severity were recorded on a 0-3 scale 8.

Blood collection and serum separation

Two milliliters of venous blood were taken into a
sterile glass tube without additives under complete
aseptic precautions. Blood was allowed to clot at
room temperature for 30 min before separation. Then,
serum was separated by centrifugation (Centurion
Scientific, K3 Series, UK) at 1000xg for 5 minutes to
be used in ASST, BHR and BAT-CD203c. Another
two milliliters of venous blood were collected in
heparin containing tubes to identify the basophil
activation markers by flowcytometry.

Autologous serum skin test

Intradermal injections were performed in the volar
aspect of forearm, all with a 1 ml sterile insulin
syringe and 2.5cm away from each other, of 50u1 of
fresh undiluted serum and sterile physiological saline
as a negative control. As a positive control skin test,
histamine | mg/ml (Omega, Canada) was applied by
skin prick testing. Wheal and flare responses were
measured after 30 min. The maximum vertical (d1)
and horizontal (d2) diameters of the red wheal
response induced by the serum and normal saline
control were measured. Then, the average diameter
(D) was calculated [D = (dl + d2) / 2]. The test is
considered positive if the wheal response of the
injected serum was with an average diameter of 1.5
mm or more than that of the negative control after 30
min 9, 10.

 

Basophil histamine release (BHR)

The assay was carried out as illustrated by
Yasnowsky et al., [9]. Quantitative measurement of
histamine was done by using a commercial ELISA kit
(SunRed Biotechnology, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Flowcytometric Assessment of CD203c

basophils in the whole blood

- In vivo basophil CD203c expression, Phycoerythrin
conjugated anti-IgE antibody (PE, Miltenyi Biotec
GmbH, Germany) and fluorescein conjugated antihuman CD203c (FITC, Miltenyi Biotec GmbH,
Germany) consequently were added to the
heparinized patients’ blood samples according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Then, the cell pellet was
re-suspended in 0.5 ml of PBS (phosphate buffer
saline) for analysis by flowcytometry, Fluorescence
Activated Cell Sorting (FACS Calibur) (BectonDickinson, San Diego, California, USA).

-BAT-CD203c (serum induced CD203c expressions
on donor basophils): Two hundred Ll of heparinized
whole blood from the same donor used in BHR assay
(non-atopic -blood group O- healthy donor to obtain
unprimed basophils) were incubated for 10 min at
37°C with 40 uL from patients ‘sera, healthy
individual’s serum (as a negative control) and the
serum of the same disease control used in BHR (as a
positive control) 11. Then, the cells were stained with
PE anti-IgE antibody and FITC anti-human CD203c,
according to manufacturer’s instructions before being
analyzed by FACSCalibure flowcytometery.

The corresponding isotopic negative controls
(Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Germany) were used and the
total counted events were 30,000. The CD203c

basophil cells percentage was determined in the dot
blot by gating the basophils by using the side scatter /
IgE gating strategy. The cells were excited with a
single 488 nm argon laser. FITC green fluorescence
was detected at 510 nm while PE orange yellow
fluorescence was detected at 575 nm.

Statistical Analysis

Data were collected, entered and analyzed by using
SPSS version 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).
For quantitative variables: data were expressed as
mean + SD, median and range. For categorical
variables: data were expressed as number and
percentage. Data were summarized using Wilcoxon
Signed Ranks test and McNemer test.

Discussion

Atorvastatin has been prescribed extensively
for its lipid lowering effect. However,
compelling evidence now exists that statins
also have extensive immunomodulatory
properties that operate independent of
cholesterol lowering effect. Our study tested
the effect of Atorvastatin in combination to
antihistamines in alleviating the symptoms
in CSU patients in comparison to a placebo
group. In studying the effect of this regimen
of treatment, it was found that total severity
score (TSS) of urticaria significantly
decreased in this group of patients
(P=0.000). This finding was similar to the
results of Pezeshkpoor et al., [2].

In the current study, there was also
significant difference in the median diameter
of ASST before and after treatment
(P=0.002), although, there was no difference
in the positivity of ASST (P=1.000). This
was different from the finding of
Pezeshkpoor et al., [2] who reported that
there was significant difference in the test of
ASST 3 months following treatment with
atorvastatin and antihistamines in these
patients (P=0.001) [2]. We could explain
that difference in our results and the study of
Pezeshkpoor by racial factors which might
need to prolong the period of treatment more
than 3 months to have significant difference
in the positivity of ASST.

We found that median percent of
histamine release and in vivo basophil
CD203c expression was __ significantly
reduced after this regimen of treatment
(P=0.000). These results agreed with those
of Majlesi et al. [6], despite the different
study approaches. In the current study, we
tested the in vivo effect of atorvastatin on
BHR and basophil CD203c expression in
CIU patients while Majlesi & his coworker

Role of Atorvastatin in Treatment of CSU Patients

tested the ability of the cerivastatin and
atorvastatin to inhibit growth and activation
of the basophils (CD203c upregulation) and
to reduce their capability to release
histamine in vitro [6].

We conclude that atorvastatin, could be
effective in the treatment of CSU patients
when it is prescribed in addition to
antihistamines.
