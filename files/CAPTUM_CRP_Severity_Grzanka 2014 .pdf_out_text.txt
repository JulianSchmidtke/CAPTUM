Background. Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is associated with activation of acute phase response. On the other hand, it is
known that systemic inflammation may lead to increased formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), associated with
pathogenesis of various diseases. Aim. We aim to test whether chronic inflammation manifested by activated acute phase response
may provide a mechanism for increased serum AGEs concentration in CSU. Methods. Concentrations of AGEs were measured
spectrofluorimetrically in serum of CSU patients and the healthy subjects. Results. Serum AGEs and albumin concentrations in
CSU patients were significantly lower as compared with the healthy subjects. Serum CRP concentration was significantly higher in
patients with CSU than in the controls. Significant positive correlation was observed between AGEs and albumin concentrations
in the subjects. Conclusions. CSU is not associated with increased circulating AGEs concentrations, despite the enhanced systemic
inflammatory response. Paradoxical decrease of serum AGEs concentrations is probably a reflection of lower concentration of

 

“negative acute phase proteins” such as albumin.

1. Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is an inflammatory disease, probably caused by an interactive combination of immune, genetic, and environmental factors,
including infections [1, 2]. Various changes in levels of
immune-inflammatory, coagulation/fibrinolytic, hormonal,
and metabolic markers have been reported in CSU patients
[3-9].

It has been demonstrated that advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) may be involved in different processes associated with urticarial inflammation, including complement
activation, release of inflammatory cytokines, increase of
vascular permeability, and procoagulant effects [10-14].

AGEs are formed by nonenzymatic glycation processes
and accumulate slowly in tissues and circulation during

ageing and more rapidly in diabetes and renal failure [10, 12,
15]. In addition, accelerated increase of AGEs accumulation
may be determined in an inflammatory milieu. The accumulating evidence points to AGEs involved in progression
of inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases [10, 13].
Interestingly, AGEs upregulate C-reactive protein (CRP)
synthesis by human hepatocytes through stimulation of IL-6
[16]. CRP is the marker of systemic CSU activity, reflecting
the systemic effects of inflammatory mediators associated
with the disease, including IL-6 [5, 17]. Therefore, it seems
interesting to test whether chronic inflammation manifested
by activated acute phase response may lead to increased AGEs
accumulation in CSU patients. Circulating concentrations of
AGEs as well as their association with albumin “negative
acute phase protein,’ CRP “positive acute phase protein” have
been investigated in CSU patients and in the healthy subjects.
2. Materials and Methods

37 patients with active CSU (26 women and I] men; mean age:
39 + 9.5 years) with a median disease duration of 2.9 years
were enrolled in the study.

In all cases, any known causes of CSU were ruled in
(out) by appropriate investigations. Each patient underwent
the following tests: routine laboratory tests (full blood count,
urine analysis, ESR, C-reactive protein, serum glucose, hepatic functions, and creatinine), stool (for parasites), hepatitis
serology, antinuclear and antithyroid microsomal antibodies,
thyroid function tests, chest X-ray, and abdominal ultrasonography. Additionally, dental and ENT consultations as
well as the autologous serum skin test (ASST) [1] were
performed.

The urticaria activity score (UAS) was estimated during
four days and on the blood sampling day and graded as
follows: mild (0-8), moderate (9-16), and severe (17-24). The
study comprised 20 patients with mild and 17 patients with
moderate-severe urticaria symptoms.

None of the examined subjects had taken any oral
corticosteroids within 5 weeks or antihistamines within at
least 5 days before the study.

The control group consisted of 24 healthy individuals (13
women and 11 men), of comparable age (41.3 + 8.2 years) and
BMI (<30).

The Ethics Committee of the Medical University of
Silesia approved the study and written, informed consent was
obtained from all the subjects participating.

2.1. Blood Collection. Blood samples were taken on fasting,
from elbow veins. Sera obtained by centrifugation were stored
at —85°C until the tests were performed.

2.2. Assay of AGEs. AGEs in the tested sera were determined by flow spectrofluorimetry, according to the method
described by Zilin et al. [23]. Conditions were adapted for
high-pressure liquid chromatography HPLC-Ultimate 3000
(Dionex, USA) with fluorescent detector RF 2000 (Dionex,
USA). The coefficients of variance for intra-assay and interassay were 1.4% and 7.2%, respectively. The method's sensitivity
was 0.112 mg/L.

2.3. Assay of CRP and Albumin. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and albumin concentrations were assayed using
Roche/Hitachi cobas c system. Normal lab ranges were lower
than 5.0 mg/L and 35-52 g/L, respectively.

2.4, Autologous Serum Skin Test (ASST). Intradermal ASST
was performed following the method by Sabroe et al. [1].
Serum-induced red wheal response of diameter greater by
at least 1.5mm than that of a control wheal induced by
physiological saline was accepted as positive. Skin prick test
with histamine served as a positive control.

2.5. Statistical Analysis. The obtained results were presented
using basic parameters of descriptive statistics, such as
median value, quartile range, mean value, and standard

deviation. Normal distribution of data was measured using
Shapiro-Wilk’s test. Independent data between the groups
of patients with CSU and the control group and between
CSU patients with mild and moderate-severe symptoms
were compared using nonparametric U Mann-Whitney test.
Spearman’s rank test was used for correlations. The P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant. Calculations were
performed with STATISTICA for Windows 10.0 software
(StatSoft, Cracow, Poland).

3. Results

3.1, Serum AGEs Concentration. Serum concentration of
AGEs was significantly lower in CSU patients (as a whole)
as compared with the healthy subjects (median: 3.42 versus
26.92 mg/L, P < 0.00001; Figure 1). In addition, there were
significant differences in serum AGEs concentration between
CSU patients with mild and moderate-severe symptoms as
compared with the healthy controls (median: 3.54 and 3.25
versus 26.92 mg/L, P < 0.00001; Figure 1). Concentration
of AGEs in mild CSU group did not differ significantly as
compared with severe CSU group (P > 0.05; Figure 1).
No significant differences in AGEs concentrations between
ASST(+) and ASST(—) CSU patients (selected according to
the similar UAS) were observed.

3.2. Serum Albumin Concentration. Serum concentration of
albumin was significantly lower in CSU patients (as a whole)
as compared with the healthy subjects (median: 35.66 versus
47.03 g/L, P< 0.00001; Figure 2). There were significant
differences in serum albumin concentration between CSU
patients with mild and moderate-severe symptoms as compared with the healthy controls (median: 36.66 and 35.31
versus 47.03 g/L, P < 0.00001; Figure 2). Concentration of

albumin in mild CSU group was significantly higher than in
moderate-severe CSU group (median: 36.66 versus 35.31 g/L,
P = 0.045; Figure 2).

3.3. Serum CRP Concentration. Serum CRP concentrations
were significantly higher in CSU patients as compared with
the healthy subjects (median: 2.85 versus 1.02mg/L, P<
0.00001). There was no significant difference in serum CRP
concentration between patients with mild CSU and the
healthy controls (median: 1.2 versus 1.02 mg/L, P = 0.07);
however, CRP concentration in moderate-severe CSU group
was significantly higher than in the control group (median:
10.30 versus 1.02mg/L, P < 0.00001). There was also
significant difference in serum CRP concentration between
patients with mild and moderate-severe CSU (median: 1.2
versus 10.30 mg/L, P < 0.00001).

3.4, Associations. There was significant negative correlation
between albumin and CRP concentrations in CSU patients
(R = -0.38, P = 0.02), but not in the healthy subjects (R =
-0.05, P = 0.79). In addition, significant positive correlation
was noted between concentrations of AGEs and albumin (R=
0.74, P = 0.000000) in the subjects. There were no significant
correlations between AGEs and CRP concentrations either in
CSU patients (R = —0.06, P = 0.7) or in the healthy controls
(R= -0.07, P = 0.7).

4. Discussion

We present the first evidence to prove that, in CSU patients,
regardless of the disease activity/severity, the sera AGEs
concentrations were significantly decreased as compared
with the healthy subjects. On the other hand, serum CRP

concentration was significantly increased as compared with
the healthy subjects. At the first glance, it seems paradoxical
that serum AGEs concentrations in CSU patients were not
increased despite low-grade systemic inflammatory response.

There are some mechanisms, which may account for
lower circulating AGEs concentrations in CSU. Firstly,
the decreased serum AGEs concentrations can simply be
explained by the decline of serum albumin, an important
binding site for AGEs [11]. In CSU patients we observed lower
serum albumin concentration as compared with the healthy
subjects. The contrasting concentration of albumin between
CSU patients and the healthy subjects may be explained by
activation of acute phase response in CSU.

It is known that, in acute phase response, the synthesis
of “positive acute phase proteins,’ such as CRP, is increased,
whilst the circulating concentrations of the so-called “negative acute phase proteins,’ such as albumin, are decreased
{17, 18]. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that IL-6
is able to reduce albumin mRNA expressions [19]. On the
other hand, it is known that CSU is associated with increased
circulating concentration of IL-6 [5].

In our study, serum CRP concentration was significantly
higher in CSU patients as compared with the controls, confirming previous observations regarding acute and chronic
urticaria [8, 20, 21]. In addition, significant negative correlation was observed between CRP and albumin concentrations
in CSU patients, but not in the healthy subjects.

Interestingly, the positive relationship between albumin
and AGEs in the subjects suggests that the decrease in
albumin may contribute to lowered AGEs concentration, as
most plasma AGEs are irreversibly bound to serum albumin
{18]. Therefore, decreased hepatic synthesis of albumins in
response to acute phase response or their redistribution
secondary to altered vascular permeability may contribute to
lower serum albumin concentration resulting in decreased
circulating AGEs in CSU patients.

Secondly, it might be interesting to hypothesize that
increased vascular permeability may partially contribute
to lower serum AGEs concentrations. AGEs accumulation
in vivo is found throughout the body, including the skin
{15]. Further studies are needed to clarify whether lower
serum AGEs concentrations are associated with increased
accumulation of AGEs at the site of urticarial inflammation.

Thirdly, food intake represents an important source of
circulating AGEs [22]. It seems unlikely that diet contributes
to lower serum AGEs concentration in CSU patients, because
there have not been significant differences in the dietary
AGEs intake between the two groups.

Moreover, CSU patients had no documented diseases
or complications, which are recognized as associated with
changes in AGEs accumulation in the circulation, including
diabetes, renal insufficiency, and hepatic failure [10, 15, 23,
24]. On the other hand, formation of AGEs may be accelerated in immunological and respiratory disorders, including
allergic rhinitis [25].

In our study, decreased circulating AGEs were not correlated with severity of CSU; serum AGEs concentrations,
which were decreased even in mild CSU, were similar to those
of moderate-severe CSU.
5. Limitation

Despite the small number of subjects enrolled, the present
findings have clearly demonstrated a significant decrease
of serum AGEs concentration in CSU patients. AGEs in
tissue may better reflect the chronic accumulation of AGEs
than measuring AGE from serum or plasma. Unfortunately,
indices of tissue AGEs accumulation were not measured in
our study. It is possible that serum concentration of AGEs
is an inadequate reflection of those accumulated in the skin
of CSU. Our observation does not exclude the possibility of
local AGEs formation/accumulation in the skin, particularly
in severe CSU.

6. Conclusion

CSU is not characterized by increased circulating AGEs
concentrations, despite the enhanced systemic inflammatory
response associated with acute phase response.

With regard to the assumed dependency of circulating

AGEs concentrations on serum albumin concentration, it
should be noted that serum albumin concentration was
significantly lower in CSU group as compared to the healthy
controls. Correspondingly, a direct, positive relation between
AGEs and albumin concentrations was observed. Thus, paradoxical decrease of serum AGEs concentrations is likely to
reflect lower concentration of “negative acute phase proteins,”
such as albumin.
