Introduction

Summary

The disturbed cytokine-chemokine network could play an important role in
the onset of diseases with inflammatory processes such as chronic idiopathic
urticaria (CIU). Our main objectives were to evaluate the relation between
proinflammatory chemokine serum levels from CIU patients and their
response to autologous skin test (ASST) and basophil histamine release
(BHR). We also aimed to assess the chemokine secretion by peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) upon polyclonal stimulus and to evaluate
chemokine C-C ligand 2/C-X-C chemokine 8 (CCL2/CXCL8) and Toll-like
receptor-4 (TLR-4) expression in monocytes. We observed significantly
higher serum levels of the CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CCL2 in CIU
patients compared to the healthy group, regardless of the BHR or ASST
response. The basal secretion of CCL2 by PBMC or induced by Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin A (SEA) was higher in CIU patients than in the
control group, as well as for CXCL8 and CCLS5 secretions upon phytohaemagglutinin stimulation. Also, up-regulation of CCL2 and CXCL8
mRNA expression was found in monocytes of patients upon SEA stimulation. The findings showed a high responsiveness of monocytes through
CCL2/CXCL8 expression, contributing to the creation of a proinflammatory
environment in CIU.

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a skin disorder characterized by
recurrent and transitory itchy weals that last for 6 weeks or
longer. CU can be accompanied by angioedema in 40% of
the cases, has a higher incidence in women (2:1) and a prevalence of approximately 0-1%, with an average episode length
of 3-5 years in adults [1]. Despite the extensive search for
underlying causes or triggering factors, the aetiology of CU
remains unclear in at least 80-90% of the patients; therefore,
it is referred to as chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU). In
addition, the term chronic autoimmune urticaria has been
proposed for those 35-40% of the CU patients who develop
anti-immunoglobulin (Ig)E IgG to the receptor alpha
subunit and for an additional 5-10% that produce anti-IgE
IgG autoantibodies [2,3].

The functional properties of antibodies can be evidenced
in vitro with the release of histamine from basophils and
mast cells elicited in the presence of serum from CIU
patients [2,4]. In vivo evidence can be achieved by intrader

patients with CIU [5]. Nonetheless, the ASST has been considered an autoreactivity test rather than a specific test for
autoimmunity [6].

It has been suggested that inflammation in CU patients
does not result solely from the consequences of mast cells (or
basophil) degranulation [7]. In CIU patients, inflammatory
aetiopathogenesis has been related to an increase in the
interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13 and IL-18 serum levels or in factors
such as neopterin [8-10]. Our previous findings support the
concept of immunological dysregulation in CIU with disturbed cytokine production by T cells - related mainly to
IL-17 and IL-10 production — regardless of skin reactivity to
ASST [11]. The possibility of other factors, such as chemokines, acting in parallel to the cytokines is not excluded and
should be investigated for CIU.

Chemokines are proinflammatory chemotactic cytokines
that recruit leucocytes to inflammation sites, but also play
important roles in tumour growth, angiogenesis, organ

sclerosis and autoimmunity [12,13]. Chemokines are a
superfamily of small proteins (8-14 kD) classified on the
basis of their structural properties regarding the number and
position of conserved cystein residues [14]. C-X-C chemokine 8 (CXCL8)/IL-8, which is the best-characterized C-X-C
chemokine, is chemotactic for neutrophils, T lymphocytes
and monocytes [15-17].

CXCL9/Mig, a monokine induced by interferon (IFN)-y,
acts as chemoattractant for T helper type 1 (Th1) cells and
blocks eosinophil chemoattraction, the platelet-activating
factor and leukotriene B4-induced responses [18]. Both
CXCL9 and CXCL10/IFN-y-induced protein 1 (IP-10) are
considered type 1 chemokines and display strong chemoattraction for Th] cells [19,20]. In contrast, the C-C chemokines, of which chemokine C-C ligand 2 (CCL2) (monocyte
chemoattractant protein-1) is a prototypic example, activate
a variety of cells, including monocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, eosinophils and basophils, and have been implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases [13,21]. CCL2 is a
crucial factor for the development of adaptive Th2 responses
[22] and also causes degranulation of mast cells and, mainly,
basophils [23]. Together with other factors, CCL2, CCL5 and
CXCL8 have been suggested to play a fundamental role in
histamine and serotonin generation in mast cells and are
mediators of acute inflammatory responses [24]. Considering the important roles of chemokines and their receptors in
the inflammatory process of several skin diseases [25-27], it
is possible that the proinflammatory chemokines together
with other factors, such as like cytokines, contribute to the
immune dysregulation in CIU.

Due to the role of CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL2 and
CCL5 in innate immune response and inflammation, we
evaluated the level of these chemokines in sera from CIU
patients and compared their ASST and BHR responses.
Moreover, to evaluate the chemokines produced by monocytes and T cells, we assessed (i) the ability of peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to secrete CXCL8 and
CCL2 in response to superantigen, a stimulus to monocytes
plus T cells and polyclonal T cells, and (ii) the relative levels
of mRNA and protein in CD14* cells and CD4* T cells.

 

 

Materials and methods

Study subjects and ASST

CIU patients who had recurrent and transitory itchy weals for
more than 6 weeks, at least four times a week, were selected
from the Dermatological Outpatient Clinic of the Hospital
das Clinicas de Sao Paulo. Patients with physical urticaria,
urticarial vasculitis or food allergies were excluded as
described previously [28]. Anti-histamine medications were
withdrawn 48 h before the study. The CU patients and healthy
control (HC) group who participated in our study did not
take corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs. Samples
were obtained from 38 patients with CIU (32 females and six

130

males, aged 22-80 years, median age 48-50 years) and 32
healthy controls (24 females and eight males, aged 23-60
years, median age 38-81 years). The HC group consisted of
laboratory staff who do not take corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs with no clinical signs of urticarial, asthma/
rhinitis and food allergies. All subjects gave written informed
consent, and the study protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee of the HC-FMUSP.

The ASST (autologous serum skin test) was performed
according to standard methods [5], using fresh autologous
serum injected intradermally into the volar forearm skin. A
positive test was defined as a serum-induced weal =1-5 mm
diameter more than that elicited by the saline response after
30 min.

Basophil histamine release assay

BHR was performed using leucocyte suspension from healthy
blood donors, as described by Luquin and collaborators [29].
Whole blood was collected in ethylenediamine tetraacetic
acid (EDTA) (40 ml), sedimented in 6% dextran-3% glucose0:15 M NaCl saline solution. Fifty ul of leucocytes (20 x 10°
cells/ml) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) with 2 mm CaCL, and
1 mm MgCl were incubated with 50 ul of serum in 96-well
microplates (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) for 40 min at
37°C. The positive control reaction was incubated with 50 ul
of goat anti-human IgE (12-5 ug/ml) (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) in PBS. For determining total histamine, two
replicates of cell aliquots were boiled for 5 min. Reaction was
stopped by the addition of 25 ul of 20 mm/ml EDTA and
ice-cold buffer, and centrifuged. Histamine concentration
was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) based on the competition principle, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (IBL, Hamburg, Germany). The
optical density reading was performed at 450 nm inan ELISA
microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA)
with a SOFT max PRO program. The results are expressed as
percentage release using the formula: (sample-basal)/(totalbasal) x 100. The cut-off values for each assay were determined as the percentage of histamine release comparing
to the media obtained from healthy serum (n = 27) plus 2
standard deviations (SD).

 

Serum chemokine measurements

Serum obtained from CIU patients and healthy subjects were
measured using the human chemokine cytometric bead
array kit (Becton Dickinson, San Diego, CA, USA) and
analysed by flow cytometry [fluorescence activated cell
sorter (FACS)Calibur; Becton Dickinson]. CCL5 measurement was performed by ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN, USA). The optical density reading was performed at
450 nm in an ELISA microplate reader (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with a SOFT max PRO program.

In vitro induction of chemokine secretion by PBMC

PBMC were obtained from heparinized venous blood by
Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation (GE Healthcare BioSciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) and diluted in RPMI-1640
medium supplemented with 10% AB human serum (Sigma,
St Louis, MO, USA). Cultures of PBMC (3-0 x 10° cells/well)
were incubated in 24-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA,
USA) with medium or phytohaemagglutinin (PHA, 2-5 Ug/
ml) or Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin A (SEA, 40 ng/ml)
for 24h at 37°C and 5% CO). Cell-free supernatants were
harvested and stored at —80°C until chemokine measurement by ELISA (R&D Systems). The limits for chemokine
detection by ELISA are as follows: 7-81 pg/ml for CXCL8 and
CCLS5 and 23-44 pg/ml for CCL2.

Flow cytometry

For intracellular CXCL8 and CCL2 staining, PBMC
(3-0 x 10°) were cultivated in RPMI-1640 medium with 10%
AB human serum (Sigma) in 24-well plates (Costar) for 18 h
at 37°C and 5% CO, with medium or SEA (1 pg/ml) and
brefeldin A (Sigma, 10 g/ml). After incubation with 10 ul of
human IgG for 10 min at 4°C, cells were labelled with antiCD14 PC5 (BD PharMingen). The cells were fixed with fixation medium (Fix & Perm medium A; Invitrogen, Calsbad,
CA, USA), washed and then permeabilized with permeabilization medium (Fix & Perm medium B; Invitrogen).
Samples were incubated with anti-CXCL8 phycoerythrin
(PE) or anti-CCL2 PE (BD Pharmingen) with their respective isotype controls. Analyses were performed in a Coulter
EPICS XL-ML flow cytometer (Coulter, Miami, FL, USA)
with System II software.

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

CD4* T cells and CD14* monocytes were isolated by magnetic cell sorting using negative and positive selection,
respectively, with magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech,
Paris, France). The purity of the two cell populations was
95% as assessed by flow cytometry. CD14* and CD4* cells
were cultivated in RPMI-10% AB human serum (Sigma) in
96-well plates (Costar) with medium or SEA (40 ng/ml) or
PHA (2:5 ug/ml), respectively, for 2 h at 37°C and 5% CO).
Total RNA from 1 x 10° cells was extracted using the RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and reverse transcription was performed with Sensiscript reverse transcriptase
(Qiagen). The real-time PCR condition was performed as
described previously [11], with the following primers:
albumin sense: 5’-GCT-GTC-ATC-TCT-TGT-GGG-CTG-T3’, albumin anti-sense: 5’-AAA-CTC-ATG-GGA-GCT-GCTGGT-T-3’, melting temperature (Im, 79°C); CCL2 sense:
5’-TCT-GTG-CCT-GCT-GCT-CAT-AG-3’,  CCL2 _ antisense: 5’-CAG-ATC-TCC-TTG-GCC-ACA-AT-3’, Tm 83°C;

chemokines messenger was normalized with the housekeeping gene, albumin, and presented as a cytokine to albumin
copy-number ratio [30].

Statistical analysis

The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare variables
between patients with CIU and healthy controls. Wilcoxon’s
test, a non-parametric paired test, was used to compare the
difference between the expression levels under basal and
stimulated conditions. P values less than 0-05 were considered significant.

Results

Circulating chemokines in CIU

Considering the active role chemokines play in inflammatory
process, we evaluated the level of the CXCL8, CXCL9 and
CXCLI10 and the CCL2 and CCL5 in serum from patients
with CIU. There was a significant increase in the level of
CXCL8, 9, 10 and CCL2 in CIU sera in comparison with the
HC group (Fig. 1). The CCL5 chemokine was detected at
the highest concentration, but no difference was observed
between the levels found in sera from CIU or HC groups. The
relation among levels of chemokines in the CIU group was
CCL5 > CXCL10 = CXCL9 > CCL2 > CCL8, and in the HC
group was CCL5 > CXCL10 > CXCL9 > CCL2 >CCL8. In
fact, in HC the level of CXCL10 was higher than that of
CXCL9 (CXCL10 > CXCL9), whereas in CIU the level of
CXCL10 was found to be similar to that of CXCL9
(CXCL10 = CXCL9).

The circulating levels of chemokines in CIU patients were
tested through the ASST or the BHR assay. Table 1 shows that
of 38 patients, 21 (55-3%) had a positive response to ASST
and 44-7% were negative. For the BHR, 10 of the 38 patients
(26:3%) were positive, of whom six (60%) were both BHR*
and ASST*, and the remaining four were BHR+ and ASST.
No significant difference was found regarding the levels of
circulating chemokines between patients positive or negative
for the ASST response; similarly, no difference was found
between BHR-positive or BHR-negative. Furthermore, the
levels of chemokines were compared with the clinical
evidence for angioedema. No significant difference was
found in the chemokine levels of patients with or without
angioedema (Table 1).

of CCLS levels was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA). Horizontal line represents the median. ***P = 0-001;
**P = 0-01 compared with the HC group.

In vitro chemokine secretion by PBMC

Considering the broad influence of CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5
on the lymphocyte and monocyte populations, we evaluated
the level of chemokines secreted by PBMC using PHA
or SEA as stimulus. As shown in Fig. 2, the spontaneous

secretion of CCL2 by PBMC from CIU patients was significantly higher than that from the HC group. In addition, in
CIU patients, CCL2 secretion was greatly enhanced by SEA
stimulation, and CCL5 and CXCL8 levels were increased
using PHA as stimulus in comparison with HC individuals
(Fig. 2). The CXCL8 secretion induced by SEA was not
significantly different from the control values.

Up-regulation of CXCL8 and CCL2 and
down-regulation of TLR-4 in monocytes of
CIU patients

Monocytes from PBMC secreting CCL2 and CXCL8 were
evaluated by flow cytometry after stimulation with SEA
and in the presence of brefeldin. Also, levels of CCL2 and
CXCL8 mRNA from CD14* cells treated with SEA were
analysed by real-time PCR. We found that in PBMC the
CD14* cells were the main source of CXCL8 in both groups
(Fig. 3a), as the analysis of CD4* and CD8* T cells showed
fewer than 2% of positive cells for CXCL8 secretion (data
not shown).

The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of intracellular
CXCL8* in CD14" cells with or without SEA stimulation was
significantly lower in CIU than in HC subjects (Fig. 3c).
Similar results were observed for the percentage of CD14*
cells secreting CXCL8 (data not shown).

In contrast, the mRNA analysis from CD14* cells stimulated with SEA (Fig. 3e) revealed an increased CXCL8 expression in CIU patients compared to HC. The up-regulation of
the CXCL8 mRNA and protein levels detected in the supernatant of cell cultures suggests that activated monocytes in
CIU individuals secrete the chemokine in vivo quickly; this
could interfere with the in vitro capture of the intracellular
protein.

CCL2 was secreted mainly by CD14* cells (Fig. 3b) and its
basal expression decreased in CIU patients whereas, after
SEA stimulation, similar levels were observed for both CIU
and HC groups (Fig. 3d). Analysis of CCL2 expression in
CD4* T and CD8* T cells, naive or memory B cells, as well as
basophils, were negative (data not shown).

Similarly to CXCL8, the CCL2 mRNA level increased
after SEA stimulation in CD14* cells from the CIU group

compared to HC (Fig. 3f). These findings show the activation status of monocytes in CIU and hyperresponsiveness to
SEA stimulation. Moreover, considering that Gram-positive
bacterial superantigenic exotoxins can up-regulate the transcription and membrane expression of TLR-4 in human
monocytes [27], we evaluated the ex vivo TLR-4 expression
in CD14" T cells. Interestingly, TLR-4 expression on monocytes from patients was reduced significantly compared to
HC CD14' cells (Fig. 4a).

In view of the high levels detected for CCL5 secreted by
PBMC, we evaluated the expression of the CCL5 mRNA
levels in CD4* T cells by real-time PCR (Fig. 4b). The CCL5
mRNA levels in CD4* T cells with or without PHA stimulation were similar in both patients and control groups
(Fig. 4b). Also, the expression of the CXCR5 receptor on
CD4* T cells, evaluated by flow cytometry, showed similar
MFI between groups (data not shown).

Discussion

The combination of chemokines may exert a key influence in
the innate and adaptive immune response and could explain
why T cells or other cell subtypes become activated in CIU.
We have shown previously in CIU a disturbance in the T cell
response for IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-17a secretion [11].
Furthermore, we have also shown a disturbance in the innate
immune response in CIU related to cytokine secretion by
plasmacytoid dendritic cells though TLR-9 activation [31].
In this sense, we demonstrated that the altered chemokine
synthesis is related to the dysfunction of the innate immune
response in CIU. Therefore, we evaluated the chemokines
that exhibit a broad effect on monocytes, a subset scarcely
studied in CIU. Accordingly, CXCL8 was chosen, as it is
chemotactic for neutrophils, T lymphocytes and monocytes [15,17], and also CXCL10, as it is chemotactic for

ASST or BHR response. Moreover, chemokine up-regulation
was not correlated with clinical parameters such as angioedema, which was detected in 59% in the cohort of CIU
patients. Of these chemokines, we focused on CCL2, in view
of its increased serum levels in CIU, the spontaneously active
secretion by PBMC, and the high secretion levels induced by
SEA stimulation. The crucial source of CCL2 was monocytes, as shown by the increased mRNA expression in CD14*
cells in CIU. CCL2 is one of the key factors involved in the
initiation of inflammation, triggering chemotaxis and
transendothelial migration of monocytes to inflammatory
lesions by interacting with the membrane CC chemokine
receptor 2 (CCR2) in monocytes [32]. CCL2 also has a
potent basophil histamine release activity [22]; in CIU, a
normal basophil response to CCL2 has been reported,
whereas it cannot be ruled out that CCL2 might be involved
in histamine release [33]. In fact, it seems that serum
factor(s) could be involved in the activation of basophils, as
basophils from patients with CIU are hyperresponsive to
serum, but such a factor is yet to be identified [29]. Previously, we observed that basophils from patients with CIU
displayed up-regulation of the activation/degranulation
markers, CD203c and CD63, and high responsiveness to IL-3
stimulation [28]. This basophil-activated profile was due
probably to an in vivo priming triggered by a potent

basophil-activating factor such as CCL2; therefore, we
observed increased CCL2 serum levels associated with active
secretion by monocytes that, together, could contribute, at
least in part, to the activated status of basophils in CIU
patients.

In addition, several other chemokines may also be
involved in the recruitment/activation of monocytes. In this
regard, it has been demonstrated that the stimulation of
CCL5 leads to recruitment of monocytes/macrophages
which express CCR5 and CCR1, both of which bind CCL5
with high affinity [34]. In CIU the target cells are mast cells
and basophils, in which mast cell activation requires an
assembly of circulating chemokines, such as CCL5, CCL2
and CXCLS8 that together play a fundamental role in histamine and serotonin generation [24]. In this sense, not only
CCL5, but CCL2 and CXCL8 were also significantly more
abundant in CIU; up-regulation of these chemokines in
patients with CIU may possibly contribute to the maintenance of activated status of cell subsets, such as basophils,
monocytes and T cells. It is probable that the disturbance of
chemokine synthesis may be one of the triggering factor(s)
of the inflammatory status in the CIU.

The activated status of monocytes in CIU was reinforced
by hyperresponsiveness to SEA stimulation. Superantigens
bind directly to specific regions of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules on the antigenpresenting cells and to the variable region of the B chain of
the T cell receptor [35]. Interestingly, a decreased TLR-4
expression on CD14* cells from CIU patients was observed
in ex vivo conditions. It has been described that histamine
could inhibit the expression of CD14 on monocytes through
the stimulation of H2-receptors [36]. TLR-4 requires CD14
to participate in the process of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)induced signalling; whether there is a direct action from
histamine released by skin mast cells, or by a secondary effect
of H1-anti-histamine on regulation of TLR-4 expression on
monocytes, needs to be explored further. Together, these
findings suggest that there is an ongoing inflammatory
process in CIU.

In conclusion, the results showed that patients with CIU
present an altered chemokine secretion pattern that is potentially connected to their chronic inflammatory status.
Up-regulation of CCL2 and CXCL8 genes, measured by
mRNA levels and cell-secreted protein in serum, indicates
igh responsiveness from monocytes, contributing to the
creation of a proinflammatory environment in CIU. These
findings suggest that the innate immune system through
chemokines and monocytes could lead to the immune activation contributing to the pathogenesis of CIU.
