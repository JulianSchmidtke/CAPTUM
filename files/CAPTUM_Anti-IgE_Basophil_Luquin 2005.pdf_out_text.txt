Summary

Background Although it has been shown that basophils from patients with chronic ordinary
urticaria (CU) are less responsive than normal basophils when stimulated with anti-IgE, very few
studies have examined the response of those cells to alternative stimuli.

Objective To compare releasability between basophils from healthy donors and patients with CU.
Methods We examined the response of IL-3-treated basophils from healthy donors, atopic controls
and CU patients to anti-IgE, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), bradykinin, CSa and to
sera obtained from other urticaria patients and normal controls. We also compared the response of
basophils from CU patients whose sera activate normal basophils (autoimmune CU) from those who
do not (idiopathic CU).

Results Basophils of CU patients release significantly less histamine than basophils of normal
controls when stimulated with anti-I[gE, and to a lesser degree with C5a. No differences were
observed when basophils from patients were incubated with Bradykinin or MCP-1. However, when
basophils of CU patients were incubated with sera from other CU patients or even normal sera, we
found significantly higher histamine release compared with the response of basophils from normal
donors. We could not distinguish responsiveness of basophils of patients with chronic autoimmune
urticaria from patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria.

Conclusion Basophils of patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria and chronic autoimmune
urticaria are hypo-responsive to anti-IgE and CSa, normally responsive to MCP-1 or bradykinin,
and hyper-responsive to serum. The serum factor to which a response has not yet been identified;
however, basophils of patients with chronic urticaria, in general, appear to have abnormal regulation
of signaling pathways.

Introduction

Urticaria is considered chronic when it is present daily or
almost daily for 6 weeks or more. Apart from physical
urticarias and urticarial vasculitis, in the majority of cases we
cannot establish a cause. It has been suggested that this entity
be named chronic ordinary urticaria (CU) [1]. An autoimmune origin is found in a subpopulation of such patients
based on the ability of patients’ sera to activate normal donor
basophils and induce histamine release. This is because of the
presence of anti-IgE receptor antibody (35-40%) and/or antiIgE (5-10%) [2-4]. CU patients lacking any detectable
autoantibody are designated ‘idiopathic’ [5] because no
alternative etiology has been found.

Most studies have focused on the properties of chronic
urticaria sera, but few studies have compared basophils
(or mast cells) derived from chronic urticaria patients to
basophils derived from normal donors. Prior reports have
demonstrated that basophils of patients have a diminished response to anti-[gE [6-8] but no differences in
releasability was found with stimuli such as fMLP, A23187
and PAF [9].

In this study of basophil releasability, we examined the
response of basophils of healthy donors, atopic donors and
patients with chronic urticaria to a variety of stimuli including
anti-IgE, bradykinin [10], monocyte chemoattractant protein1 (MCP-1) [11], CSa [12-14], and serum.

Furthermore, we divided chronic urticaria sera in two
groups, one whose serum was able to activate normal
basophils and therefore believed to be autoimmune, and the
group lacking this ability, designated chronic idiopathic
urticaria. We compared histamine releasability when these
sera are incubated with basophils derived from patients with
chronic urticaria.

Materials and methods

We studied basophils from 30 patients with chronic urticaria
(21 female, age: median: 47(37; 57)), 21 healthy control
subjects (17 female, age: median: 27(25; 35)) and 12 atopic
donors (six female, age: median: 28(20; 45)). The number
of basophils employed for each experiment is included in
Table 1. These basophils were incubated with sera from
another 20 healthy donors (15 female, age: mean:
38.08(14.44)) and 45 patients with chronic urticaria (31
female, age: 45.54(12.9)).

We defined chronic urticaria patients as having recurrent
hives of greater than 6 weeks duration, occurring at least four
times a week, with individual lesions lasting less than 24h.
Antihistamine treatment was stopped at least 48h before
serum samples were collected, and none of the patients were
taking corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs at the time
of veinpuncture. Patients with clinical evidence of urticarial
vasculitis or physically induced urticaria (e.g. cold urticaria,
cholinergic urticaria, dermatographism) were excluded.

We considered atopic controls as those patients with
rhinitis and/or asthma, or eczema, and a positive skin test
to at least one allergen, and specific IgE (CAP-FEIA,
Pharmacia, Upsala, Sweden) against that allergen. We
included as healthy donors those with negative skin prick
tests to a standard pool of common allergens, no history of
hives, rhinitis, asthma, or eczema, and normal IgE levels.

All sera were separated by centrifugation at 1000g for
10 min and stored at — 80°C.

Leucocyte isolation

Because the aim of our study was to compare basophils, we
only included those CU patients with no basopenia in order
to be able to adjust basophil number. We found that 25% of
our CU patients had basopenia and so were not included in
this work.

10mL of whole blood was collected in EDTA coated
venepuncture tubes and were mixed with 2 mL of 3%dextran3%glucose-0.15M NaCl saline solution. The mixture was
sedimented for 90 min, the supernatant was removed, and the
cells were placed in 15mL conical tubes, which were washed
twice with HBSS-HSA at pH 7.4 (NaCl, KCl, Hepes 10mm,
HSA, Glucose, NaH P04, double distilled water). The cells
were then resuspended in HBSS-HSA containing 2mm

CaCh, 1mm MgCl. For all the experiments the basophil
number was adjusted to 1 x 10*/mL. Manual basophil counts
were performed at a 1/2 dilution of an alcian blue-based stain
[15] using a modified Fuchs—Rosenthal (Manners) chamber,
as described previously [16] and expressed as counts/L of
whole blood.

Once adjusted for cell number, we incubated basophils with
a buffer containing IL3 for 15min at 37°C (Hepes 20mm,
NaCl 133mm, KCl 5mm, CaCl, 7mm, MgCl 3.5mm, BSA
lmg/mL, 2ng/mL of IL3) and then incubated this cell
suspension with the different stimuli for 30 min at 37 °C. After
incubation, the supernatants were separated by centrifugation
at 1000g for 10min at 4°C, and histamine release was
determined. Two replicate aliquots of cells were boiled to
determine total basophil histamine content.

Histamine release from basophils

We employed two techniques to determine histamine release.
We utilized an ELISA assay for the study of the histamine
release by serum. To compare histamine release from
basophils of healthy subjects and chronic urticaria patients
stimulated with bradykinin, MCP-1, CSa, anti-IgE, spontaneous release and total histamine content, we utilized a
fluorometric technique. This was because of practical
considerations e.g. amount of sera needed and cost of
determinations. Both techniques were performed in our
laboratory in the same experiments with the same cell
suspension. The only variation between the two techniques
is the amount of sample employed.

For the ELISA technique, 75uL of serum or buffer was
incubated with 75uL of basophil suspension for 30min at
37°C.

Histamine release was measured by ELISA (Immunotech
International, Marseille, France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and replicate samples agreed within 10%.
For the fluorometric technique, 250 uL of buffer or stimulus
was incubated for 30min at 37°C with 250uL of cell
suspension and histamine was assayed by fluorometric
method [17] as previously described [18].

We calculated the percentage release using the following
formula: (Sample-Basal)/(Total-Basal)* 100. Spontaneous histamine was less than 5% of total histamine.

The sensitivity of both methods is 0.5 ng/mL.

Subjects were identified as having functional autoantibody
to the IgE receptor when sera released 15% or more when
incubated with basophils of healthy donors. This percentage
was calculated based upon the results obtained with 24
control sera from healthy subjects [3]. The percentage
histamine release in this study varied from 2-20% with a
mean of 9.7% and a standard deviation of 3.6%. A response
of 2SD from the mean was considered positive.

Statistical analysis

To compare two independent samples (Basophils of patients
vs. healthy with stimuli: bradykinin, MCP-1 and CSa) we
used the Students’ ¢ test when the distribution was normal
(MCP-1) and the Mann-Whitney U-test for a non-normal
distribution (bradykinin and CS5a). We used the Mann—

Whitney U-test to compare the histamine released upon
stimulation with sera.

To compare the spontaneous and total histamine release
between healthy controls, atopic controls and chronic
urticaria patients, we utilized a nonparametric test for Kindependent samples (Kruskal-Wallis) followed by a Mann—
Whitney U-test. We used the same test to compare the
histamine released upon stimulation with anti-IgE.

To compare basophil histamine release from patients with
and without the anti-[gE receptor autoantibody, we employed a Mann-Whitney U-test.

Results
Anti-lgE histamine release

When we stimulated basophils of chronic urticaria patients
(CU basophils) with anti-[gE and compared the results with
histamine release upon stimulation of basophils from healthy
controls with anti-IgE, we observed a significantly decreased
histamine release in CU basophils (median: healthy control,
51.04%; atopic, 50.91; CU, 10; P=0.000). There were no
differences in histamine release between healthy controls and
atopic subjects (Fig. 1).

Spontaneous and total histamine content

We then compared spontaneous and total histamine release
between controls, atopic subjects and CU basophils in order
to assess whether these differences were because of differences
in histamine content. We found that in spite of a much lower
histamine release when stimulating with anti-[gE, CU
basophils release more histamine at basal conditions with
no stimulus (Fig. 2a). Spontaneous histamine release was
significantly higher in atopic donors (Median: healthy
controls, 1.58ng/mL; atopic donors, 5.65; CU patients,
3.08 ng/mL; healthy controls vs. urticaria patients P = 0.03,
atopic donors vs. urticaria patients P>0.05, healthy donors
vs. atopic subjects P = 0.002).

In contrast, significant differences were not found when
comparing total histamine content between control and CU
basophils, although there was a significantly higher total
histamine content in atopic basophils vs. healthy controls

Histamine release when stimulating with bradykinin, C5a
and MCP-1

We then compared histamine release with stimuli that act
upon different receptors, each of which signals via G proteins
such as bradykinin, CS5a and MCP-1.

We found a significantly decreased response of CU
basophils compared with normal basophils at the lower C5a
concentration employed i.e. at 10 and 100ng/mL, but not
with | ug/mL (Fig. 3) although the trend with | pg suggested a
diminished response of CU basophils as well.

With bradykinin, CU basophils had a slightly diminished
response compared with basophils of healthy controls, but
the differences did not reach statistical significance.

There were also no differences upon stimulation of
basophils of chronic urticaria patients and healthy controls
with MCP-1.

 

Histamine release when incubating with sera

Surprisingly, we observed a much greater histamine release
when basophils of CU patients were stimulated with other
chronic urticaria patients sera compared with healthy
basophils stimulated with CU sera. Moreover, even those
sera that were not able to activate healthy basophils were
highly active on CU basophils compared with healthy
basophils. Finally, control sera were also able to activate CU

basophils more readily than healthy basophils. The results
indicate that basophils of chronic urticaria patients are more
responsive to some constituent of serum regardless of source,
that sera from urticaria patients are more active than healthy
sera, and that sera of patients with chronic idiopathic
urticaria are no less active in this assay than are sera from
patients with chronic autoimmune urticaria (Fig. 4).

Releasability depending upon the presence of the
autoantibody

Finally, we wanted to study whether there were differences in
releasability with the different stimuli studied between those
patients having anti-receptor autoantibody and those that do
not. For this purpose, we compared basophil releasability
from basophils selected from 10 patients whose sera were able
to induce histamine release when incubating with control
basophils, and five from those which were not able to do so.
We did not find statistically significant differences in any
instance. Thus both groups of basophils were equally
responsive to bradykinin, CSa, MCP-1, or serum. These data
are summarized in Table 2.

Discussion

In this work, we confirm previous reports concerning a
diminished histamine release of chronic urticaria basophils
when incubated with anti-IgE [6, 9]. These results are not
because of a variation in histamine content because we did
not find significant differences between healthy control and
urticaria basophils. We did, however, observe higher total
histamine content and spontaneously released histamine
when basophils of atopic subjects were compared with
basophils of healthy controls or patients with chronic
urticaria. These results are consistent with those published
by Wahn [19] and Zuberbier et al. [9].

Although basophils of chronic urticaria patients seem to be
less responsive to stimuli such as anti-IgE or CSa, which act
through different receptors, the abnormality does not seem to
be because of a general impairment of signaling because CU
basophils do respond normally to other stimuli that act
independently from the IgE receptor such as A23187, FMLP
and PAF [9], bradykinin [10], and MCP-1 [20].

In this study in the autoimmune group we routinely do not
distinguish between anti-receptor and anti-IgE antibody

because anti-IgE is much less common: 5% compared with
40%. It has been hypothesized that hypo-responsiveness is
because of in vivo desensitization of the basophils [21], but
this may not be the case because we also find decreased
responsiveness of basophils obtained from patients lacking
anti-receptor antibody. In fact, when we compared releasability after incubating (data included in Table 2) basophils
from patients with or without identifiable autoantibodies with
anti-IgE, we did not find any significant difference. This
differs from a prior report of Sabroe et al. [22] but their data
were derived from one donor whose basophils were IgEdepleted and a second donor whose basophils were sensitized
with IgE, and therefore are not comparable.

Our most surprising finding was that chronic urticaria
basophils, in spite of being less responsive to many stimuli,
are clearly highly responsive when incubated with sera; even
normal sera. One could argue that this effect might be
because of variability in donor basophil histamine release;
however our study employed the same basophil preparation
incubated with different stimuli. When different basophil

preparations were compared, the counts were similar, and the
results were strikingly consistent for all CU basophils studied.
Moreover, we previously found (as it is observed in vivo), that
CU basophils release histamine when incubated with their
own serum as well as sera of others (data not shown).

In summary, we conclude that chronic urticaria basophils
have several specific features that distinguish them from
basophils of healthy donors or atopic controls. They are less
respondent to anti-[gE and CSa with no difference when
stimulated with bradykinin and MCP-1 and have much higher
release when incubated with serum. The factor in serum that
stimulates these cells has not been identified nor is the
abnormal responsiveness of the cells understood. The other
known basophil abnormality in chronic urticaria is basopenia,
which is present in patients with anti-receptor antibody as well
as those with chronic idiopathic urticaria [23, 24].

Although 55% of chronic urticaria patients are still
considered idiopathic because the etiology is obscure,
including absence of autoantibodies, this is the first demonstration that basophils of this group share abnormal
responsiveness with basophils of patients with chronic
autoimmune urticaria, just as the histology of the two groups
is strikingly similar [25, 26].
