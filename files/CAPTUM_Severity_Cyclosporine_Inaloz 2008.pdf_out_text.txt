ABSTRACT

The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of 2.5 mg/kg/day cyclosporin (CsA) treatment in patients
with severe chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) and the impact of CsA treatment on several cytokines involved in the
etiopathogenesis of CIU. Twenty-seven CIU patients and 24 healthy control subjects were included in the study.
The autologous serum skin test (ASST) for autoantibodies and urticaria activity scoring (UAS) were measured for
the evaluation of the clinical severity and the response to therapy, and the serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6,
IL-8, IL-2 receptor, IL-1B, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-c and IL-5 were measured. The mean UAS score was
32.07 + 7.05 and 6.22 + 3.84 before and after CsA treatment, respectively. The serum IL-2 receptor, TNF-a and
IL-5 levels of patients before CsA treatment were statistically higher than those of the control group (P = 0.001),
and after 4 weeks of CsA therapy the mean IL-2R, TNF-a and IL-5 levels were significantly decreased. The data
from this study demonstrate that CsA therapy is efficient and safe for CIU patients. Increase in clinical efficacy
and marked decreases in serum cytokine levels suggest that inhibition of cytokine generation is involved in the

action of the drug in this clinical setting.

INTRODUCTION

Urticaria is a cutaneous vascular reaction induced
by immunological or non-immunological mechanisms. Chronic urticaria is characterized by recurrent
episodes of transient wheals, frequently associated
with angioedema, present daily or at least twice a
week for over 6 weeks. The disease is diagnosed as
“idiopathic” when no causative factor can be identified. Approximately 15-20% of people develop at
least one episode of urticaria in their lives and in less
than 20% of them an etiological factor has been
identified."

Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is occasionally
unresponsive to therapy with antihistamines and
difficult to treat. Mast-cell degranulation and release
of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines from

chronic idiopathic urticaria, cyclosporine, interleukin, tumor necrosis factor-G.

the secretory granules of the mast cells play the
major role in the pathogenesis of urticaria. Presence
of circulating histamine releasing factors, autoantibodies against the high-affinity immunoglobulin
(Ig)E receptor (FceRI) or against IgE, were found in
approximately 30% of patients with CIU.?* Clinical
improvement after removal of autoantibodies by
plasmapheresis‘ and by immunomodulatory therapy,
and demonstration of association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR4, suggest that autoimmune
mechanisms could be involved in the pathogenesis
of ClU.®

In view of these findings, immunosuppressive
drugs have been proposed in the treatment of the
disease.® In particular, cyclosporine A (CsA) has
been used when antihistamines fail and prolonged
steroid treatment is required. Therefore, the aim of

benefit in patients with severe CIU and the impact
of CsA treatment on cytokine levels involved in the
etiopathogenesis of CIU.

METHODS

Patients

Twenty-seven patients (20 females, 74.07%; seven
males, 25.93%) with CIU (an episode of urticaria at
least twice a week for over 6 weeks) and 24 healthy
control subjects (11 females, 45.83%; 13 males,
54.17%) without a history of atopia, drug use or any
systemic disorder, who were admitted to the Dermatology Outpatient Clinic of Gaziantep University,
School of Medicine, were included in the study. This
study was approved by the local ethics committee
and a written consent form was obtained from each
subject.

The mean age of the patients was
36.18 + 11.76 years (range, 17-59). The control
group consisted of 11 females (45.83%) and 13
males (54.17%) and the mean age was
32.46 + 9.52 years (range, 23-39). The disease
duration was in the range of 3-180 months (mean,
50.29 + 48.75). All patients were unresponsive to
antihistamines; eight subjects were given systemic
steroids but none of them had previously received
immunosuppressant therapy.

Cyclosporine treatment in chronic urticaria

The detailed medical histories of all patients were
evaluated together with dermatological examination.
The characteristics of urticaria plaque (distribution
of lesions, number of lesions, number of separate
episodes, size and duration of lesions), coexistence
of angioedema, number of recurrences, response to
drug therapy, history of atopia and the possible
causative factors (foods, drugs, any disease association of lesions, hot, cold, sunlight exposure,
pressure, trauma) were established. The serological
tests (i.e. acute phase reactants, C-reactive protein,
erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C3, C4, IgE, antinuclear antibody [ANA], antistreptolysin O [ASO],
hepatitis markers) and routine biochemical tests
(i.e. electrolytes, liver functions tests, blood urea
nitrogen, creatinine, thyroid function tests), urine
analysis, Gaita microscopy, and hemograms were
performed. Radiological imaging of systems was
also performed if required. The exclusion criteria
are listed in Table 1.

Study design and protocol

In this prospective, controlled study, the patients
with chronic idiopathic urticaria (n = 27) and healthy
control subjects (n = 24) were enrolled. The patients
received oral cyclosporine (Sandimmum Neoral;
Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) at a dosage regimen
of 2.5 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses for
4 weeks.

Autologous serum skin test (ASST), a screening
test for autoantibodies, was applied to the patients
following an “antihistamine wash-out” period of
3 days (7 days for patients treated with ketotifen) as
described previously.’ Sterile autologous serum and
saline (0.1 cc) were injected i.d. 3cm apart from
each other to clinically uninvolved volar forearm
skin. The wheal and flare response were evaluated
at 30 min. ASST was accepted as positive if the
diameter of wheal after autologous serum injection
was 1.5mm greater than the wheal diameter
induced by saline injection. The test was assessed
by the same physician.

Serum samples were taken from patients before
and after drug therapy for the measurement of
interleukin (IL)-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-2 receptor (IL-2R),
IL-1B and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-« levels.
Serum IL-6, IL-8, IL-2R, IL-1B, TNF-o levels were
measured with an Immulite Immunoassay Analyser

Patients
Figure 1. Urticaria activity score of patients before and
after cyclosporine therapy.

(Immulite DPC, Los Angeles, CA, USA) and IL-5
level was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method (Human IL-5 ELISA;
Cytimmune Sciences, College Park, MD, USA).

Urticaria activity scoring (UAS) was performed
before and after the treatment to diagnose the
clinical severity of urticaria and response to therapy.
Number and average size of lesions, and pruritus
severity were rated on a 3-point scale and the total
score was recorded. The patients were evaluated at
baseline and weekly for 4 weeks upon completion
of the therapy. The treatment was considered
effective if the score at completion of the therapy
was less than 25% of the score recorded before
therapy.

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were carried out by using a
statistical package, SPSS for Windows ver. 6.0
(SPSS Software, Chicago, IL, USA). The results
were expressed as mean + standard deviation. The

278

comparison of UAS, IL-2R, TNF-o and IL-5 values of
patients before and after therapy was analyzed by
paired Student’s t-test, and comparison of these
values between patients and controls was analyzed
by an independent samples Student’s t-test. The
level of statistical significance was set at P = 0.05.

RESULTS

An ASST was performed in all patients before and
after therapy, and ASST positivity was found in 11
(three males, eight females,) of 27 patients (40.74%).
The mean UAS score was 32.07 + 7.05 (range,
16-42) and 6.22 + 3.84 (range, 0-15) before and
after CsA treatment, respectively. In a total of 19
patients (70.37%), the score reduced by 25% after
CsA treatment. Thus, these patients were considered to be in total remission. The reduction of the
UAS score after CsA treatment was statistically
significant in all patients (P < 0.005) (Fig. 1).

Serum IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1 levels in the control
and study groups before and after CsA therapy were
less than 5 pg/mL. Serum IL-2R, TNF-a and IL-5
levels of the control and study groups before and
after therapy are shown in Table 2. The serum IL2R level of patients before CsA treatment was found
to be statistically higher than that of the control
group (P = 0.001). After 4 weeks of therapy, the
serum IL-2R levels of patients showed a statistically significant decrease (652.66 + 213.04 and
522.48 + 172.80 U/mL, before and after therapy,
respectively; P < 0.0001). There was no significant
difference between the serum IL-2R levels of control
and study patients (P = 0.274). The serum TNF-«
levels of the patients in study and control groups

© 2008 Japanese Dermatological Association
before treatment were 14.26 + 4.17 pg/mL (range,
5.6-30.1) and 8.08 + 2.44 pg/mL (range, 4.6-10.9),
respectively (P < 0.0001). The mean TNF-a level
showed a significant decrease after treatment with
CsA (7.81 + 3.69 pg/mL; range, 4.1-16.5; P = 0.001).
The serum TNF-« levels did not show a significant
change before and after CsA treatment in the control
group (P = 0.139).

The mean IL-5 level of the study patients was
significantly higher than that of the control subjects
(244 + 67.18 pg/mL [range, 12.76-737.00] and
98.15 + 32.23 pg/mL [range, 24.36-266.24], respectively (P = 0.001). After CsA therapy, IL-5 was noted
to be 114.95 + 36.61 pg/mL (range, 2.91-281.31)
in the study group and this reduction was significant compared to the level before CsA therapy
(P = 0.001). No significant difference was observed
between the IL-5 levels of the control group before
and after CsA therapy (P = 0.284).

During the treatment with CsA, only one patient
experienced abdominal pain and nausea. This
patient showed no laboratory abnormality and this
adverse effect disappeared in 2 days when omeprazole was added to CsA therapy.

DISCUSSION

In the present study, 2.5 mg/kg/day CsA treatment
for 4 weeks was found to be effective in terms of
lowering the serum levels of cytokines IL-2R, IL-5
and TNF-o, which have been shown to be higher in
patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria.

The pathogenesis of CIU involves primarily the
mast cells and histamine as the main mediator.
Approximately 30-60% of patients with CIU have
circulating histamine releasing autoantibodies to the
high-affinity IgE receptor Fc RI on basophils and
mast cells or, less commonly, antibodies to IgE.
ASST is the in vivo clinical test for detection of
in vitro basophil histamine-releasing activity. Mast
cell activation results in the release of both preformed
(histamine) and newly formed (prostaglandins)
mediators from cytoplasmic granules, which cause
wheal formation, vasodilatation and erythema.
Mast cell degranulation also releases various chemokines and cytokines that are involved in wheal
formation. Immunohistochemical findings support
the involvement of these factors in the disease

pathogenesis.*"* Inflammatory cell infiltration and
mast cell increase have been shown in skin biopsy
specimens from urticarial lesions of CIU patients.
In the initial stage of lesions, the predominant cell
type is the CD4 T cells and the cytokine and chemokine release contribute to the inflammatory process." It was also shown that IL-4, IL-8 and TNF-o
cytokines are produced by dermal mast cells.°°'5

Piconi et a/. reported increased levels of cytokines
such as TNF-a, IL-10 and macrophage inhibitor
protein (MIP)-10 in CIU patients when compared to
healthy controls.® A high TNF-a. level was also demonstrated in skin biopsy specimens of these patients
in various studies'®"” Ying et al. noted eosinophil
and neutrophil infiltration in biopsy examinations as
compared to non-atopic subjects and also high
CD3*, CD4*, CD8*, CD25* T-lymphocytes and IL-4,
IL-5 and y-interferon (IFN-y) levels in these
patients.'* Supporting these findings, in our study,
we found statistically higher IL-2R, TNF-« and IL-5
levels of CIU patients before CsA treatment when
compared to controls. These cytokines were also
reported to be high in serum and skin biopsy samples
of CIU patients in previous studies. The consistency
of our findings with other studies supports the
hypothesis that cytokines derived from T cells play
an important role in CIU etiopathogenesis.

Cyclosporine forms a complex with the cytosolic
immunophilin, cyclophilin, which binds to and inhibits
the activity of the intracellular enzyme calcineurin
phosphatase. This reduces the effect of the transcription factor in T cells (nuclear factor of activated
T cells) that regulates transcription of a number of
cytokine genes, the most significant being IL-2.
IL-2 serves as the major activation factor for T
cells in numerous immunological processes. CsA
also inhibits histamine release from mast cells and
downregulates various cellular adhesion molecules.'*?' Reduced expression of cellular adhesion
molecules on dermal capillary endothelium decreases both T-cell and neutrophil infiltration. CsA
also has an inhibitory effect on antigen-presenting
cells, such as Langerhans and dendritic cells, which
are potent stimulators of T cells. Additionally, IL-2,
IL-2R, IL-3, IL-4, TNF-a and IFN-y production are
also inhibited by CsA.” The IL-3, IL-4 and IL-5
lowering effect of CsA was also detected in various
studies.” 6

In a previous study with CsA therapy for atopic
dermatitis, the patients received CsA at a dose of
3.5 mg/kg/day for 3 months. In these patients, IL-2R,
CD30* and IL-4 levels were found to be decreased
after CsA therapy. Moreover, a negative correlation
between decrease in IL levels and clinical recovery
was observed in the same study.”’ In another study,
CsA therapy was shown to reverse high IL-2R and
TNF-a. levels in patients with atopic dermatitis.?°
Consistent with these findings, in our study, we
observed a marked increase in clinical efficacy as
serum IL and cytokine levels decreased with the use
of CsA. The evaluation of the severity of the disease
and efficacy of therapy via UAS revealed a 25%
decrease in score after 2.5 mg/kg/day CsA therapy
indicating a total remission.”°

The release of mast cell-derived mediators may
be caused by both immune and non-immune
mechanisms. FceRla on the mast cell surface is a
high-affinity IgE receptor that binds the Fe portion
of IgE, resulting in histamine release. IgG autoantibodies against this receptor appear to be the
etiological factor in as many as 25% of patients with
CIU. Other agents, such as aspirin, opioids and
adenosine, cause mast cell degranulation directly
through non-immunological means. The functional
activity of these autoantibodies, suggested in vivo
by ASST, has been confirmed in vitro by the basophil
and mast cell histamine release assays.°° Additionally,
removal of the autoantibodies by plasmapheresis
produced clinical improvement in patients with
CIU.* Western blot analysis and ELISA have
confirmed the presence of these autoantibodies.*"
ASST positivity provides indirect evidence of histamine-releasing activity (HRA) in the serum.”

Recent findings suggest that in 25-45% of
patients, CIU is not idiopathic but is an autoimmune
disease. Coexistence of other autoimmune diseases
and recovery after immunosuppressive therapy
imply that autoimmunity plays a role in the etiopathogenesis. In our study patients, the ASST
positivity was found to be 40.7% and was consistent
with the autoimmune nature of the disease.

Chronic idiopathic urticaria is sometimes unresponsive to therapy with antihistamines and is difficult to treat.’? If antihistamines fail to treat CIU
patients, the corticosteroids are used as alternative
agents to control acute exacerbations. However,

280

frequent recurrences and adverse effects related to
long-term use of steroids are the limiting problems
in the management of CIU.*"? Thus, the treatment
protocols including immunosuppressive agents
have been used for patients with severe CIU which
is resistant to conventional therapies and were
found to be effective.°*°°

Although several studies have reported the effectiveness and tolerability of CsA in the management
of severe forms of chronic urticaria, the precise mechanism of action of the drug is not understood completely. Experimental studies suggest that this drug,
along with its immunosuppressive action, has antiinflammatory and anti-allergic properties as well.'®*

The incidence of side-effects associated with
low-dose cyclosporine is rare. In previous studies, it
was reported that because no adverse effect was
seen at the dose of 3-5 mg/kg/day, monitoring of
drug level was not necessary.°*° In our study, only
one patient experienced nausea and abdominal
pain which is consistent with previous studies
demonstrating minor side-effects.°°**

In conclusion, the data of this study demonstrate
that CsA therapy is efficient and safe for CIU
patients. However, it is necessary to observe longterm CsA treatment in future studies because it may
help patients maintain long periods of remissions.
Increase in clinical efficacy with a concomitant
decrease in serum cytokine levels suggests that
inhibition of cytokine generation is involved in the
action of the drug in this clinical setting.
