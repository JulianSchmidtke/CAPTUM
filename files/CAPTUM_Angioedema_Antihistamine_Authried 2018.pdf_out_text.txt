Introduction

Summary

A subset of patients with angioedema (AE) and urticaria has histamine releasing autoantibodies. The histamine release test (HR-test) has been used as a tool in chronic urticaria to
define the autoimmune subgroup and may possibly guide the clinician to a more personalized
therapy, like omalizumab and cyclosporine. The prevalence and value of positive histamine
releasing autoantibodies in monosymptomatic AE is sparsely described in the literature. The
purpose of this study was to report the prevalence of positive histamine releasing autoantibodies
in a cohort of patients with recurrent AE and evaluate the usefulness of this test in AE patients. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 612 patients referred due to AE between
1995 and 2013. HR-test results were available in 404 patients. In the sub-group of patients
with AE and urticaria, 17.3% had a positive HR-test but only 4.3% of patients with mono-symptomatic AE had a positive HR-test. No statistically significant treatment benefits of
antihistamines, corticosteroids or adrenaline were found comparing patients with angioedema
+/- urticaria based on the result of the HR-test (negative / positive). Thus, the HR-test result
cannot be used as predictor of the efficacy of anti-allergic treatment.

Functional histamine releasing autoantibodies have been identified by the HR-test in approximately 20-30% of patients with

Angioedema (AE) is a non-pitting skin colored swelling of skin
or mucosa, with a predilection for areas with loosely bound.
skin. It is caused by a temporary increase in vascular permeability due to vasoactive mediators.

Mostly, AE is accompanied by urticaria, which indicates activation
of mast cells liberating histamine and other vasoactive mediators.
A subset of patients with urticaria and AE has histamine-releasing
autoantibodies. The basophil histamine release test (HR-test) is
a remedy to identify activation of basophils or mast cells causing
histamine release. It has been used as a tool in chronic urticaria
(CU) to define the autoimmune subgroup, and it is the current
gold standard to detect histamine releasing autoantibodies to the
FceRI and less frequently against IgF (1,2).

CU (2-6). In contrast to CU or AE accompanied with urticaria,
where histamine releasing autoantibodies can be frequently detected, sparse data can be found on the prevalence of histamine
releasing autoantibodies in recurrent idiopathic AE (7).

The objective of this study was to report the prevalence of positive histamine releasing autoantibodies in a cohort of patients
with recurrent idiopathic AE, and evaluate the usefulness of
HR-test in this patient group.

pital, in the study period 1995-2013. All patients had been
referred for specialized dermatologic evaluation, due to AE
with or without urticaria. The study-population was identified by a search in the medical record system, using the International Classification of Disease version 10 (ICD-10) diagnostic codes T78.3 (angioneurotic edema / Quinke oedema
/ giant urticaria), L50.8 (urticaria, other), L50.8A (chronic
urticaria) and L98.9 (disorder of the skin and subcutaneous
tissue, unspecified). Patients were included in the cohort if
the information in the medical records were in accordance
with AE, with or without urticaria. Patients with complement
Cl inhibitor deficiency and acquired complement C1 inhibitor deficiency, as well as patients with a history of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema, were
excluded. Only AE patients who had a HR-test performed
were included in this study (404 patients). Figure 1 demonstrates the process of inclusion and exclusion of patients. A
consultant dermatologist or a resident reviewed the medical
records. Relevant data on demographics, concomitant rash,
co-morbidity, co-medication, treatment regimens and efficacy, hospital admissions and outcome were collected, as well as
selected laboratory test results.

HR-test was analyzed at RefLab Aps Copenhagen (http://reflab.
dk/). According to this laboratory, the threshold for a positive
result was > 16.5 % histamine release.

Ethical considerations

This study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (Journal number 2008-38-0035) and the Danish National
Board of Health (Journal number S-20140165).

Statistical analysis

Patients with AE with or without urticaria were compared using
Fisher's exact test. Difference of proportion test and odds ratio
calculations was employed when comparing treatment efficacy.
P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. 95%
confidence intervals (CI) were reported when appropriate.

Results

The study population comprised 612 patients. HR-test was performed in 404 patients meeting the study’s inclusion criteria. The
male : female ratio was 0.73, with a mean age of 50.2 years (range
2-85 years). The cohort was almost exclusively Caucasian. The
mean follow-up time was 66.4 weeks. Further details are shown in
table I. In two patients the test results could not be retrieved, and

 

in three patients it was uncertain from the medical record if they
also had urticaria. These five patients were excluded (figure 1).

The HR-test was positive in 10 out of 231 patients with AE
without urticaria (4.3%) and in 29 out of 168 patients with

Discussion

In this retrospective study of 404 patients, we analyzed the frequency of functional histamine releasing autoantibodies in a
cohort of patients with AE with or without urticaria. We found
a frequency of 4.3% with a positive HR-test in the subgroup of
patients with mono-symptomatic AE, and 17.3% with a positive HR-test in the subgroup of patients with AE and urticaria.
This makes sense, since the wheal and flare response is most
often connected to histamine release, whereas the vasoactive
mediators in angioedema are more dubious and may include
other mediators such as bradykinin (8).

Comparing patients with mono-symptomatic AE with positive
HR-test contra negative HR-test, the odds ratio was 1.9 for having a positive effect of antihistamines. This could be a signal to
guide in an individualized therapy, but unfortunately the finding was not significant, possibly due to the number of included
patients. In a large clinical survey, it has been shown that most
patients (254 of 294) with monosymptomatic AE responded
completely or partially to antihistamines, however no data on
the HR-test was provided (9).

In the subgroup of AE patients with co-existing urticaria, neither the treatment efficacy of antihistamines, corticosteroids
nor adrenaline differed significantly between HR-positive and
HR-negative individuals. Unfortunately, we could not retrieve
sufficient efficacy data of cyclosporine in this study. It is known
from the literature that patients with antihistamine-unresponsive urticaria and a positive HR-test may respond better to cyclosporine than patients with a negative HR-test (3,10). No data
on monosymptomatic angioedema, HR-test and treatment response to cyclosporine or other drugs could be found.

Sparse data could be found in the literature on HR-testing in
patients with angioedema (7). Only the study by Tedeschi and
coworkers investigated HR-testing in monosymptomatic angioedema patients. They divided their cohort into subgroups
of patients with AE with or without urticaria, suggesting that a
positive HR-test is linked to urticaria and not AE, which could
be confirmed in this study. Higher rates of positive HR-tests
were found in the literature, possibly explained by a lower cutoff value in the majority of these studies as seen in Table III
(3-5,7,10-19).

The main limitations of the present study are the retrospective design with data collection from the patients’ medical records over
a 20-year period. We cannot exclude possible bias in the study,
as different colleagues have made the clinical observations and
not all symptoms may be listed in the medical records. The HRtest became commercially available in our country in 2004, and
has been used routinely in all patients with urticaria seen at our
department between 2005 and 2013. A prospective study would
be preferable, and should include a valid and reliable measure of
disease activity; i.e. the Angioedema Activity Score (20).

We could not compare data with autologous serum or plasma
skin tests (ASST and APST), as these are not routinely performed in our country. According to the findings of Berti et
al., there does not seem to be any association between in vivo
and in vitro tests in patients with CU (19), and the same could
be true for AE. The performance of ASST and APST would
be desirable to study in the future, to confirm these findings
also in mono-symptomatic AE. In conclusion, we cannot see
any diagnostic or therapeutic value of HR-test in mono-symptomatic AE.
