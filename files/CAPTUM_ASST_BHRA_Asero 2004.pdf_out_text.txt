Summary

Background All previous studies agree that only a proportion of sera from patients with chronic
urticaria (CU) positive on the autologous serum skin test (ASST) are able to induce histamine release
in vitro. A non-specific release of bradykinins during clotting of blood samples has been suggested;
however, ASST seems rather specific and some data point to the existence of a mast cell-specific
histamine-releasing factor.

Objective To assess whether, and to what extent, the use of both human basophils and mast cells
increases the sensitivity of in vitro histamine release assays (HRAs) in ASST-positive patients with
CU.

Methods The histamine-releasing activity of sera from 93 patients with CU selected on the basis of
strong skin reactivity on ASST was assessed in vitro on basophils from | (n = 86), 2 (n= 31), or 3
(n= 20) normal donors, and on mast cells from | (n= 3), 2 (n= 3), or 3 (n= 87) normal donors.
Results Sera from 88/93 (95%) patients induced significant histamine release from mast cells or
basophils on at least one HRA. 76/93 (82%), 45/90 (50%), 22/80 (28%), and 6/12 (50%) sera were
able to induce significant histamine release from cells of 2/5, 3/5, 4/5 and 5/5 donors, respectively.
Conclusion Sera from nearly all ASST-positive patients with CU are able to induce histamine
release in vitro. However, the serum from each single patient seems to show its maximal activity on
autologous mast cells in vivo, and functional in vitro tests show much variability and seem less

sensitive than ASST in the detection of patients with histamine-releasing factors in their blood.

Introduction

Chronic urticaria (CU) is characterized by the occurrence of
transient cutaneous weals, with or without angioedema, for
more than 6 weeks. During the last 15 years, some light on the
pathogenesis of this disease was shed, first showing that the
intradermal injection of autologous serum (ASST, autologous
serum skin test) causes a weal-and-flare reaction in 30-60%
of patients, particularly during the active phases of the
disease, and subsequently demonstrating that sera from CU
patients may induce histamine release from normal basophils
in vitro (HRA, histamine release assay) [1-9]. Histaminereleasing activity has been ascribed to circulating IgG
antibodies specific for the high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI)
present on mast cells and basophils [4-8] or for IgE [2, 3].
However, several aspects remain controversial, particularly
the marked differences between in vivo (ASST) and in vitro
(HRA) findings. Histamine release induced by purified antiFeeRI IgG in vitro is markedly enhanced by complement [92], a fact that has not been observed in vivo [13-15].

Moreover, although the prevalence of both positive ASST
and positive HRA may show some differences in distinct
series of patients depending on the severity of the disease in
the study population, the technique of ASST, and the marked
variability of histamine releasability between basophils from
different healthy donors [16], all studies agree that only a
proportion of sera from ASST-positive patients are able to
induce histamine release in vitro [4, 5, 14, 17]. In a recent
study, we found that only 20% of ASST-positive sera were
HRA-positive as well [14]. Some authors suggested that this is
due to ‘falsely positive’ ASST caused by non-specific release
of bradykinins during clotting of blood samples [11].
However, ASST seems rather specific as it scores almost
always negative in normal controls [14, 15]. Finally, the role
of circulating autoantibodies has been recently questioned by
Fagiolo et al. [13] who showed that IgG-depleted autologous
sera from patients with CU maintain their ability to induce
weal-and-flare reactions upon intradermal injection. On the
basis of all these observations, the existence of a mast cellspecific histamine-releasing factor has been hypothesized [5,
7, 14, 15]. The aim of the present study was to assess whether,
and to what extent, the use of both human basophils and
mast cells increases the sensitivity of in vitro HRA in patients
with CU.

Patients and methods

Patients and ASST

Four hundred and eighty-seven consecutive adult patients
(M/F 122/365) diagnosed as having CU at the allergy center
of Bollate Hospital (Bollate, Milan, Italy) during the last 3
years were considered eligible. Patients with physical urticaria
were excluded. CU was diagnosed on the basis of the
appearance of continuous or recurrent hives with or without
angioedema for more than 6 weeks. Five days after antihistamine therapy (cetirizine, loratadine, or fexofenadine in
all cases) was stopped, an intradermal test with 0.05mL of
fresh autologous serum (ASST) and with saline as negative
control was carried out. ASST was performed and read at
30 min following the method by Greaves [17] and Sabroe et al.
[18]. A skin prick test (SPT) with histamine 10mg/mL was
carried out to exclude any residual effect of anti-histamine
rugs. Patients showing a pink weal with a diameter at least
1.5mm greater than the control saline solution were
considered positive [18]. Of 234 patients positive on ASST,
3 subjects showing strong skin reactivity (ie. a weal
iameter > 15mm) were finally included. In all these subjects,
the mean diameter of the weal-and-flare reaction induced by
autologous serum was >20mm. In patients with CU, strong
skin reactivity on ASST has been associated with the presence
of circulating autoantibodies to FceRI [18].

Basophil HRA

Leucocyte suspensions from normal blood donors were
prepared by dextran sedimentation of peripheral venous
blood, anticoagulated with 0.01M EDTA, and mixed with
6% dextran in saline solution (Solplex 70, Sifra, Verona,
Italy) and 30mm dextrose (Sigma Chemical, St Louis, MO,
USA). The cells were allowed to settle for 60-90 min at room
temperature, according to Lichtenstein et al. [19]. The
leucocyte-rich plasma was aspirated and centrifuged at
300g for 1Smin at 4°C, and the cell button was washed
twice in Tyrode’s buffer, pH 7.4, containing (mm) 140 NaCl,
5.5 dextrose, 2,7 KCl, 0.36 NaH,PO,, and 12 NaHCO;.
Leucocytes (with about 7 x 107 basophils) were then resuspended in 100uL volume of Tyrode’s buffer with 1.8mm
CaCl, and 0.5mm MgCh, and incubated with 100 UL of the
serum under examination, making a final volume of 200 LL.
After incubation for 40 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped
by addition of 800uL of ice-cold buffer solution and
centrifugation at 700g for 10min at 4°C. After centrifugation, the supernatants were aspirated, mixed with an equal
volume of 6% HCIO, and centrifuged at 1000g for 10 min at
4°C. Histamine concentration in the supernatants was
measured by an automated fluorometric method, according
to Ruff et al. [20]. Spontaneous histamine release was
evaluated by measuring histamine concentration in the
supernatant of unstimulated cells, incubated for 40min at
37°C. Total histamine content was obtained by adding
100pnL of 6% HClO, to 100pL of cell suspension. Net
histamine release was calculated as percentage of total
histamine content, after subtraction of spontaneous release.
A 5% release cut-off value was used. HRA was carried out
using the same sera employed for ASST. The histaminereleasing activity of sera from 86 patients was assessed on

 

 

basophils from a normal donor (experiment no.1). Sera from
31 and 20 patients were tested with basophils from 2 other
normal donors as well (experiments no. 2 and 3, respectively).
Sera from 20 patients were tested on basophils from all 3
donors. Basophils from all three normal donors were
stimulated with an optimal dose of polyclonal goat antihuman IgE antiserum (Sigma 10 pg/mL).

Mast cell HRA

Anti-IgE-responsive mast cells from breast skin, excised for
cosmetic reasons after informed consent, were used as
previously described [21]. Briefly, skin was cut into small
slices and incubated overnight with 0.5 mg/mL dispase type I
(Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), in order to remove the epidermis. The
minced tissue was digested in two cycles of incubation in PBS
containing collagenase 1.5mg/mL (CellSystems, St Katharinen, Germany), hyaluronidase type I S, 0.75 mg/mL (Sigma,
Deisenhofen, Germany) and DNAse type I, 10 ng/mL (Roche
Diagnostics), lasting 1h each. Mast cells were kept routinely
at 5% CO, and 37°C in basal Iscove’s containing 10% heatinactivated fetal calf serum, 4mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL
penicillin and 100mg/mL streptomycin, 2.5 g/mL amphotericin B (all from Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) and 0.002%
o-monothioglycerol (Sigma). For stimulation, cell suspension
was centrifuged and resuspended in 50pL PAG-CM
(25mmol/L PIPES, 119mmol/L NaCl, Smmol/L KCl,
0.0025% human serum albumin, 0.1% glucose, 3 mmol/L
Ca?*, and 3 mmol/L Mg** adjusted to pH 7.4) for incubating
30min at 37°C with 50uL of either anti-IgE (1: 10000) or
sera of CU patients. Stimulation was stopped by addition of
650 uL of ice-cold PAG-CM. After centrifugation 500 nL of
supernatants were aspirated, mixed with 500 nL 4% HclOg
and centrifuged for 10min. Corresponding to basophils,
histamine release was measured by an automated fluorometric method.

Three independent experiments with mast cells from
different donors were performed. From the total of 93 sera,
87 sera were tested on mast cells from all 3 donors and sera
from the remaining six patients were tested on mast cells from
2 donors (n= 3) and 1 donor (n = 3). Since histamine release
induced by normal sera showed much variability, a different
cut-off was used in each experiment. A cut-off corresponding
to the mean histamine release induced by five normal sera +2
SD was used in all cases.

HRA using basophils of donors 1, 2, and 3 was positive in 38/
86 (35%), 18/31 (58%), and 15/20 (75%) cases, respectively.
The proportion of sera able to induce histamine release from
basophils of at least two donors was rather low (Table 1), and
only sera from 5/20 (25%) patients were able to induce
histamine release from basophils of all three donors. Sera
from 48/86 (56%) patients were able to induce histamine
release from basophils of at least one donor.

Mast cells (Table 1)

Histamine release from mast cells of donors 1-3 was induced
by 60-78% of patients’ sera. As with basophils, sera from
most patients (86/93 [92%]) were able to induce histamine
release from mast cells of a single donor, but only a minority
of them (32/87 [37%]) were able to do so on cells from all
three donors.

Basophils and mast cells (Table 1)

HRAs with both mast cells and basophils showed marked
variability, as in many cases the same serum behaved
differently on basophils or mast cells from different donors.
Sera from 88/93 (95%) patients induced histamine release
from mast cells or basophils on at least one HRA. Sera from
74/93 (79%), 48/93 (52%), 25/84 (30%), 11/28 (39%), and
3/14 (21%) sera were able to induce significant histamine
release in assays using basophils or mast cells from 2, 3, 4, 5,
and 6 donors, respectively. The main quantitative results of
HRAs are summarized in Table 2.

Discussion

This study investigated the histamine-releasing activity of sera
from a large number of patients with CU on both human
basophils and mast cells from different donors. In our
knowledge, only two previous studies compared the histamine-releasing activity of chronic urticaria sera on both mast
cells and basophils. Niimi et al. [22] found that sera that
released histamine from basophils induced histamine release
from mast cells as well; however, these represented only a
proportion of sera from ASST-positive patients. Also Ferrer
et al. [23] found an excellent correlation between histamine
release from basophils and mast cells suggesting a common
mechanism of activation, but in that study ASST was not
considered. Our population included only subjects scoring
strongly positive on ASST, a condition that has been
associated with circulating autoantibodies specific for FceRI
or IgE [18]. Therefore, theoretically, all sera were expected to
show histamine-releasing activity in vitro. Although a large
majority of sera (94%) induced histamine release either from
basophils or mast cells in at least one experiment, significant
histamine release from both basophils and mast cells in all
experiments was observed only in a minority of cases. In most
cases several experiments with cells from different donors
were needed to observe significant histamine-releasing activity. Previous studies showed that histamine release induced by
anti-FceRI antibodies is strongly influenced by the density of
surface IgE on basophils [24]. However, if the cells from a
single donor were fully IgE sensitized, histamine release
would be induced mostly by sera containing anti-IgE
antibodies but not from sera containing functionally active
anti-FceRI antibodies, whereas, conversely, poorly IgEsensitized cells from another donor would respond to sera
containing anti-FceRI antibodies but not to sera containing
anti-IgE. This was not the case in our study where each single
serum showed a variable activity on cells from single donors.
Another possibility is that sera from patients with CU that
react in IgE-sensitized basophils and mast cells may either
behave like anti-IgE or non-competitive anti-FceRI autoantibodies. Several reasons may be advocated to explain the
variability of basophil and mast cell response to CU sera. One
important reason is the heterogeneity of the histaminereleasing activity contained in CU sera, which may be related
to an anti-FceRI antibody, an anti-IgE antibody, a mast cellspecific factor or an as yet unidentified factor [13, 15, 24].
Other factors conditioning basophil and mast cell response
are the density and the saturation of membrane IgE receptors,
and the different releasability of cells obtained from different
donors. Finally, C5a availability and C5a receptors represent
critical factors influencing basophil and mast cell response to
the activating signals contained in CU sera [12]. Complement
activation and CSa generation seem to play a critical role in
augmentation of basophil and mast cell histamine release
particularly with low concentrations of IgG autoantibodies [11].

In summary, the results of this study suggest that although
in some experiments individual factors regulate releasability,
sera from most ASST-positive patients with CU are able to
induce histamine release in vitro and therefore are likely to
contain functionally active anti-FceRI (or anti-IgE) antibodies. In conclusion, currently available functional in vitro
tests seem less sensitive than ASST in the detection of patients

with autoimmune CU and show much variability. Apparently, factors other than the density of surface IgE and the
availability of free IgE receptors (e.g. releasability and
availability of complement factors) play a role in seruminduced histamine release, and the serum from each single
patient seems to show its maximal activity on autologous
mast cells in the presence of additional conditions only. This
could also explain previous findings of autoantibody-positive
patients with chronic continuous urticaria who were free of
symptoms after treatment of HP infection or after a
pseudoallergen-free diet [25].
