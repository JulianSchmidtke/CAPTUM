Abstract

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CU) is associated with activation of the acute phase response (APR). Nevertheless,
APR-associated proteins have not been well characterized as potential biomarkers of the disease severity. To assess
the pattern of complement proteins C3 and C4 - the acute phase reactants in patients with CU. C3, C4 and CRP
concentrations were measured in serum of 70 patients showing different degrees of urticarial severity as well as in
33 healthy subjects. Serum C3 and C4 concentrations were significantly increased in CU patients as compared with
the healthy subjects and exceed the normal lab range by about 5% and 10%, respectively. Significant differences
were found between patients with mild and increased CU severity. In addition, significant correlations were
observed between C3, C4 and CRP concentrations. More severe CU is characterized by higher production of C3 and

 

C4 complements accompanied by parallel changes in CRP concentration.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CU) is associated with
systemic inflammation and neuroimmunendocrine dysfunction, during which the acute phase response (APR)
and coagulation/firbrinolysis processes are activated.
Nevertheless, apart from IL-6 and C-reactive protein
(CRP), other APR-associated proteins have not been well
characterized as potential biomarkers of the disease severity [1-7]. It is known that the complement system is
involved in mast cells activation in the course of CU [8].
The system is composed of many proinflammatory proteins. Among those, C3 is critical for activation of the
complement system as a whole. On the other hand, C4
is the major protein of the classical cascade. They play
an important role in the immune/inflammatory response
and are upregulated during APR [9].

Nevertheless, APR pattern as well as the behaviour
components of the complement system have not been
well characterized in the disease.

Serum complement C3 and C4 concentrations were
measured in CU patients with different degrees of urticarial severity in comparison with healthy subjects and
normal population reference ranges.

Methods

Seventy non-smoking patients with active chronic spontaneous urticaria of 13 months mean disease duration
(range 4-40 months) without any concomitant physical
urticaria were enrolled in the study.

Urticaria activity score (UAS) was estimated during four
days and on the day of blood sampling: no wheals = 0, 1—
10 wheals = 1, 11-50 wheals = 2, >50 wheals = 3) and pruritus intensity (no =0, mild=1, moderate = 2, severe = 3).
UAS scores: daily (minimum = 0; maximum = 6) and four
days by adding the daily score values (minimum = 0; maximum = 24). The UAS was graded as follows: 0-8 (mild),
9-16 (moderate) and 17-24 (severe). Our study comprised
20 patients with mild and 50 patients with moderate

severe utricaria symptoms as per the four days UAS. None
of the examined subjects had taken oral corticosteroids or
antidepressants within 8 weeks or antihistamines within at
least 4 days before the study. Autologous serum skin test
(ASST) and other investigations had been performed to exclude any known causes of the diseases or the concomitant
diseases. Among those, routine dental and laryngological
consultations were performed to exclude the infectious
foci. The patients were divided into two groups: ASSTpositive (n = 29) and ASST-negative (n = 41).

The control group consisted of 33 sex-, age- and BMI
(<30) matched healthy subjects. None of the controls took
any medication for at least 14 days before the study.

The Ethics Committee of the Medical University of
Silesia approved of the study and written, informed consent was obtained from all the subjects participating.

Blood collection
All blood samples were obtained between 7 and 9 a.m.
by anticubital puncture.

Assay of C3 and C4

Serum C3 and C4 concentrations were measured by the
immunoturbidimetric method on Roche/Hitachi cobas c
systems with a detection limit of 0.04 and 0.02 g/L, respectively. Normal range: (0.9 — 1.8 g/L) for C3 and (0.1 0.4 g/L) for C4.

Assay of CRP

Serum CRP concentration was measured by the turbidimetric latex agglutination method (CRP-Latex, BioSystems SA,
Barcelona, Spain) with a detection limit of 1.0 mg/l. Elevated serum CRP was defined as higher than 5.0 mg/l.

Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as median and _inter-quartile
ranges. Because data were not distributed normally,

nonparametric tests were used. Kruskal-Wallis variance
analysis was used for screening differences between the
groups. Mann-Whitney U/ test was used to compare data
between the patient groups and the healthy controls.
Spearman's rank test was used for correlations. The probability value of P< .05 was assumed significant.

Results
Serum C3, C4 and CRP concentrations in CU patients
Serum C3 concentration was significantly higher in CU
patients as compared with the healthy subjects (median:
1.36 vs. 1.15 g/L, p< 0.0001) (Figure 1). There were significant differences in serum C3 concentration between
the CU patients with mild and moderate-severe symptoms (median: 1.28 vs. 1.42 g/L, p<0.01) (Figure 1).
About 95% had normal levels (range: 0.9-1.8 g/L) of
serum C3, while 4 severe CU patients (5,7%) showed
values above normal and none was below the limit.

Concentration of this complement in mild CU group
did not differ significantly as compared with the healthy
subjects and was within the normal lab range (Figure 1).

Serum C4 concentration was significantly higher in
CU patients as compared with the healthy subjects (median: 0.28 vs. 0.24 g/L, p< 0.05) (Figure 2). There was a
significant difference in plasma C4 concentration between the CU patients with mild and moderate-severe
symptoms (median: 0.27 vs. 0.3 g/L, p< 0.05) (Figure 2).
Only in 7 patients (10%) with severe CU, the C4 concentration exceeded the normal range upper limit value.
The remaining patients had serum C4 concentration
within the normal value (0.1—-0.4 g/L). Concentration of
this complement in mild CU group did not differ significantly as compared with the healthy subjects and was
within the normal lab range (Figure 2).

Serum CRP concentration was significantly higher in
CU patients as compared with healthy (median: 6.05 vs.
1.7 g/L, p< 0.0001). There was signifficant difference in

observed (median: 1.33 vs. 1.39 and 0.32 vs. 0.28 g/L,
respectively).

Correlation between serum C3, C4 and CRP
concentrations CU patients and in healthy subjects

There was signifficant correlation between serum C3, C4
and CRP concentrations in CU patients (r= 0.46, p=
0.000068 and r = 0.30, p = 0.011, respectively), but not in
healthy subjects (r= 0.19, p= 0.3 and r=0.21, p = 22, respectively). In addition, significant correlations were
noted between circulating concentration of C3 and C4
(r=0.55, p= 0.000001) in CU patients and in healthy
subjects (r = 0.45, p = 0.008).

Discussion

It has been demonstrated that IL-6 and CRP — biomarkers
of APR correlate with severity and activity of CU [1,4,6,10].
In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between CU severity score and the mean platelet volume in
ASST-positive patients, but not in ASST-negative CU
patients [6].

In the present study, serum C3 and C4 concentrations
were significantly higher in CU patients as compared with
the healthy controls. There were significant differences between patients showing mild and more-severe degrees of
urticaria severity, however not between mild CU and the
control group. Such association might indicate a potential
role of the complement components as a marker of the urticarial inflammation severity. On the other hand, C3 and
C4 serum concentrations exceed the normal value only in
about 5% and 10% patients with more severe CU. Thus,
despite severe disease activity, C3 and C4 concentrations
remains within the normal lab range in most patients. Such

observations may restrict the clinical usefulness of such
complements as biomarkers of the disease activity in clinical practice. Taking together the previous and the current
studies, it seems that CRP is a more useful maker of CU severity than complements C3 and C4 [4]. Interestingly, significant correlations between C3, C4 and CRP were found
in CU patients, but not in the healthy subjects.

Similarities are noted between various inflammatory biomarkers in CU, the complement components - C3, C4 and
CRP share the common features belonging to APR proteins, which are synthesized mainly in liver, but there are
also some differences in their behaviour during immune/inflammatory activation. In contrast to CRP, complement
proteins C3 and C4 increase slower during APR - within
days and persist longer - for several days [9].

It seems that elevated C3 and C4 are likely to result of
increased synthesis in the liver in response to cytokines e.
g. IL-1, IL-6 or tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which are
increased in active CU and are known to control synthesis
of the APR proteins [9].

On the other hand, proximal and distal activation of the
central component of the complement system, C3 is critical for activation of the system and leads to production of
anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a), which are able to stimulate
secretion of various cytokines, including mentioned above
and chemotaxis of different cells [11]. Interestingly, the
C3aR is expressed on different cells associated with urticarial inflammation, including mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes [11]. In addition, the
complement anaphylatoxins stimulate skin mast cells degranulation with release of histamine [12], vasodilation
and increase the permeability of small blood vessels [11].

We do not know whether increased synthesis of C3
and C4 leads to enhanced generation of the active complements in CU. We can only speculate that at least one
mechanism might be responsible for increased activation
upregulated C3 and C4 in CU. It has been demonstrated
that beta-tryptase, the major protease of human mast
cells, can directly generate bioactive complements, such
as C5a along with C3a and C4a. Interestingly, both betatryptase-generated C5a and C3a, but not C4a were able
to activate human skin mast cells [13].

Our observation raises another important question: is the
increased serum C3 and C4 concentrations in CU merely a
simply biomarker of APR activation, reflected increased CU
severity or they play some active role through the cleavage
products in amplification urticarial processes. So far, available data regarding the behaviour of the complement system components in CU are scare and inconclusive [14]. It
has been indicated that the complement cascade activation,
in particular C5a is required for IgG-dependent histamine
release form mast cells in CU [8]. This results indicate that
the complement system may play an important role in urticarial processes and at least augments histamine release

in autoimmune CU. Elevated C9 levels, but not other
complements, including C3 and C4 have been reported in
CU [15]. Also, in another study, complement C3 and C4
levels were within normal limits [16]. In contrast, Zamiri
et al. reported both hypocomplementaemia, especially of
C4, and positive ASST are common and often coexistent
in CU [17]. Interestingly, C3 level was significantly higher
in patients with CU with metabolic syndrome, and was
directly correlated with a higher severity score and uncontrolled CU [14].

Further studies should examine the behaviour of active
complement components in CU.

Conclusions

CU patients with moderate-severe symptoms showed elevated C3 and C4 serum concentrations as compared
with mild CU and healthy subjects.

The increased C3 and C4 production should complement the features of more severe CU and might support
an involvement of APR and the complement system in
urticarial processes. It it is known that corticosteroids
reduce APR proteins production, we suggest then that
CU patients with higher disease severity may require
more extensive therapy, including corticosteroids or immunosuppressants. In addition antihistamines exerting
anti-inflammatory effects seem to appear especially useful also in dosage higher than standard. High APR biomarkers concentration may be considered as a hallmark
of enhanced systemic inflammation and one of the main
indications for anty-inflammatory therapy.

Similarly to CRP, elevated serum C3 concentration predict strongly cardiometabolic risk [18]. This seems of special importance in long lasting, severe CU.
