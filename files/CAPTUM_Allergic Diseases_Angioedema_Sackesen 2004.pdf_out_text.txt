Abstract: Urticaria is a common disease in children. In contrast to the
ease of its diagnosis, etiologic factors are often difficult to determine. In
order to study whether differences exist among various forms of urticaria
in childhood and whether the patterns of different types of urticaria differ
between adults and children, we extensively studied the possible causes of
urticaria in children. Fifty-four children (23 girls and 31 boys; ages 1-19
years) with various forms of urticaria were included in the study. In all cases,
questions about food allergies, food additive intolerance, drug intake, signs
of infection, causes of physical urticaria, insect bites, and personal and family history of atopy were asked. Clinical characteristics of the disease, such
as duration, recurrence, and associated angioedema and symptoms of
anaphylaxis were also investigated. Detailed laboratory tests, including
serologic, autoimmune, and allergic analyses, were conducted to reveal the
probable etiologies of urticaria. Of the study patients, 68.5% and 31.5% were
diagnosed as having acute and chronic urticaria, respectively. The patient
group with chronic urticaria was older and included more boys than the
acute group. In the acute urticaria group, infection was the most frequently
documented cause (48.6%), followed by drugs (5.4%), and food allergies
(2.7%), whereas in chronic urticaria, physical factors were the leading cause
(52.94%). The most frequently documented infection was urinary tract infection, followed by serologically determined infections of Chlamydia pneumoniae and Helicobacter pylori. In this study we found indications that
infections were frequently associated with urticaria, which suggests that
urticaria management should include a survey of certain infectious agents
in addition to a detailed history.

 

Urticaria affects 15-25% of people at some point in
their lifetime (1). In most cases, the disorder is relatively
mild, although recurrent and frustrating for both the
patient and the physician. Rarely it manifests as systemic
anaphylaxis, which may be life threatening (1,2).

Urticaria is usually present as raised, erythematous
wheals accompanied by intense pruritus. The lesions

typically last a few hours and randomly reappear. When
urticarial lesions persist for more than 24 hours, a diagnosis of urticarial vasculitis or delayed pressure urticaria should be considered (3). Patients who have both
urticaria and angioedema tend to have more severe and
persistent symptoms than patients without this combination (4). Kozel et al (5) suggested that disease history is
Sackesen et al: Etiology of Different Forms of Childhood Urticaria 103

the most useful tool in finding the underlying cause
of urticaria, and investigations should be so guided. In
children, reports of success in identifying a cause for the
urticaria range from 21% (6) to 83% (7). Infection, not
allergy, appears to be the most common cause of acute
urticaria in children (8).

In order to study whether etiologic differences exist
between various forms of childhood urticaria, we carried
out extensive investigations to determine its possible
causes.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

This prospective study was carried out in the Pediatric
Allergy and Asthma Unit of Hacettepe University Medical
Faculty between April 1, 2001, and January 31, 2002.
Fifty-four children (23 girls and 31 boys; ages 1-19 years)
with various forms of urticaria were included in the study.
Urticaria is considered acute if symptoms are present
for less than 6 weeks and chronic if they are present
for more than 6 weeks. If the duration of symptom-free
periods between urticaria episodes is longer than 6 weeks
and if the episodes last less than 6 weeks, urticaria is
considered to be “recurrent acute.”

In all instances, known causes of urticaria, including
food allergy, food additive intolerance, drug intake, signs
of infection (such as upper airway infection, otitis, urinary
tract infection, diarrhea, gastritis, and fever), signs of
connective tissue disease (such as arthritis and arthralgia), triggers of urticaria (such as cold, pressure, sunshine,
exercise, hot showers), occupational triggers (such as latex,
cosmetics, or cement), recent travel history, and insect
bites were investigated. In addition, all patients and their
first-degree relatives were questioned about the presence
of atopic diseases, including atopic dermatitis, bronchial
asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy. The duration,
recurrence, associated episodes of angioedema, and
symptoms of anaphylaxis were also recorded.

LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS

Investigations of all patients for infectious diseases
included white blood cell count, sedimentation rate, Creactive protein, antistreptolysin O, aspartate transaminase
(AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), throat and urine
cultures, urinalysis, serologic assays for Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV ), cytomegalovirus (CMV ), herpes simplex virus
(HSV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae,
Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B
virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV), and three
stool examinations for parasites.

In order to investigate autoimmune diseases, antimicrosomal and antithyroglobulin antibodies along with

antinuclear (ANA) and antideoxyribonucleic acid
(antiDNA) antibodies were measured. Antibodies and
complement levels (i.e., C3, C4) were studied in patients
with chronic urticaria. In addition, the levels of IgA,
IgG, IgM, and IgE were measured.

Skin prick tests were performed on patients with a
suggestive history and whose parents consented, using
commercial allergens: grass pollen, tree pollen, weed pollen,
Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides
farinae, Alternaria, Penicillium, Aspergillus, dog, cat, and
horse dander, wheat, peanut, hazelnut, egg white, egg
yolk, soya, and milk. A bifurcated needle was used for
the skin prick tests. A positive histamine control skin test
was performed.

A positive skin test was defined as inducing a reaction with a wheal size measuring 3 mm or more after
subtraction of the control value. Atopy was defined as
the presence of a positive reaction to one or more of the
skin test agents.

STATISTICS

Results were expressed as the mean + standard error of
the mean (SEM); percentages and groups were compared
using the Student’s t-test or Pearson chi-square test for
means and ratios, respectively. Two-sided p-values less
than 0.05 were considered significant. All analyses were
performed using the SPSS 10.0 software program.

RESULTS

Thirty-seven of 54 children (68%) were classified as
having acute urticaria and the remaining 17 (31%) were
classified as having chronic urticaria. In the acute
urticaria group, 35% of patients described a recurrence
and were classified as recurrent acute urticaria. The
characteristics of the study patients are shown in Table 1.
The children in the chronic group were older than the
patients in the acute group (mean age + SEM: 10.24+
1.22 versus 6.51 +£0.56, respectively) and the chronic
urticaria was seen more frequently in the adolescent group,
as shown in Figure 1. The sex distribution was heavily
weighted in favor of boys in the chronic urticaria group
(70%) as compared with the acute group (51%).
Angioedema was associated with urticaria in 22
patients (41%), and the most frequently affected regions
were the face and extremities. According to the type of
urticaria, angioedema was present in 37.5% of those
with the acute single-episode type, in 54% of those with
recurrent urticaria, and in 41% of those with chronic
disease. However, in chronic urticaria, angioedema was
more generalized than in acute urticaria, and the number
of affected regions, such as the face, lip/tongue, extremities,

urticaria concerning IgE levels (288.36 + 87.22 versus
148.00 + 48.09 versus 222.81 + 70.18, respectively).

Twelve patients (22%) had a personal or familial history
of atopic diseases such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, or
allergic rhinitis (Table 1). Skin prick tests were performed
in only 26 cases (7 in the acute single-episode group, 8 in
the recurrent group, and 11 in the chronic group) because
the remaining families refused skin prick testing. The skin
tests were positive in three patients in the recurrent acute
group; five patients in the chronic group were atopic. The
positive food skin tests were confirmed with open challenge.

Twenty-eight patients described an association between
food and urticaria; among them, eight patients blamed
food additives. All of these patients were tested with the
relevant allergens, however, only three of them were found
to be food allergic; two to egg white and one to wheat.
The involvement of food additives was not tested by
challenge tests, but consumption of the suspected food
did not cause any relapses during follow-up.

The most frequently documented cause of urticaria
was infection. An infectious agent was discovered in
58% of patients in the acute single-episode group, in
31% of patients in the acute recurrent group, and in 35%
in the chronic group. All the documented etiologies
of a probable infection are shown in Table 2. Parasitic
infestations were noncontributory.

Nineteen patients (35%) displayed symptoms of infection such as fever, sore throat, cough, or dysuria. Among
these, urinary or throat cultures were positive in four
patients and serum antibodies for some microorganisms
were determined in another four patients. Although there
were no signs or symptoms suggesting an infectious
disease in the remaining 35 patients (65%), urinary and
throat cultures were positive in 6 patients and serum
antibodies for some microorganisms were determined
in 9 patients (Table 3). In subjects without infectious
symptoms, urinary tract infection and positive serology
for C. pneumoniae and H. pylori were more common
than in those with infectious symptoms.

The serologic analyses for hepatitis A, B, and C were
all negative and the levels of enzymes such as AST and
ALT were within the normal range in the entire group.

Physical stimuli were described as a trigger by 16
patients: cold in 7, sunshine in 3 (1 acute patient, 2 chronic
patients), and pressure in 1, but the ice cube test was
positive in only 1 patient with chronic urticaria, and
6 patients (3 each in the acute and chronic groups)
reported that a hot bath/shower triggered the eruption.
In addition, 5 patients (3 acute and 2 chronic) described
emotional stress as being a contributory factor in their
outbreaks. None reported exercise as a cause of urticaria
onset (Table 4).

Five patients (two acute and three chronic) described
recurrence of urticaria associated with drug intolerance:

one patient with acetylsalicylic acid, one with both acetylsalicylic acid and dipyrone, and the other three with
antibiotics such as penicillin and sulbactam-ampicillin.

The contribution of autoimmune disorders was only
investigated in patients with chronic urticaria. The sedimentation rates were less than 27 mm/hr in all cases.
The complement studies, including C3 and C4 levels,
were within normal ranges. All the serum samples were
negative for ANA, antiDNA, antimicrosomal, and antithyroglobulin antibodies.

One patient with chronic urticaria described an increase
in the number of urticarial lesions coincident with
menstruation.

Recent travel histories in three patients and insect bite
histories in five patients were present prior to the onset
of urticaria. No patient had any history of urticaria
related to latex, cement, or cosmetics.

DISCUSSION

It has been suggested that acute urticaria, with lesions
lasting less than 6 weeks, is more common in young
people (4), whereas chronic urticaria, with lesions lasting
more than 6 weeks, is most common in middle-aged women
(5). Despite the limited number of epidemiologic studies
of childhood urticaria (6,7), we found that all forms of
urticaria may be observed during childhood. As only
patients with more severe hives are admitted to our
allergy clinic, it is postulated that the frequency of chronic
urticaria in those studied does not reflect its prevalence
within the general population. The frequency of chronic
urticaria significantly increases during adolescence, and
contrary to expectations (in adults, middle-aged women
are most commonly affected), the majority of adolescents
affected in our study were boys.

Angioedema is the most frequently associated symptom of urticaria, a fact stated in several sources (10,11).
Angioedema was more frequently reported by the recurrent
106 Pediatric Dermatology Vol. 21 No. 2 March/April 2004

urticaria group than by the other groups, and as suggested
by Krishnaswamy and Youngberg (12), it was observed
to be more severe and widespread in the chronic urticaria group. Urticaria and angioedema are essentially
the same process and coexist at the same time, and this
appeared in up to 40-50% of patients, both in our study
and previously. Angioedema coexists with urticaria more
frequently in recurrent urticaria.

The primary defined etiologies are different in acute
and chronic urticaria. Previously suggested in the literature is that infection, whether or not associated with
drug intake, be defined as the primary cause of acute
urticaria in childhood (13), whereas physical factors are
the leading etiology of chronic urticaria (6,14). Our
study revealed that in the acute urticaria group, infection
was the most frequently documented predisposing factor
(49%), followed by use of prescribed drugs (5%) and
food hypersensitivity (3%). In chronic urticaria; physical
etiologies proved to be the most common causes responsible for urticarial lesion augmentation (53%). Although
we did not objectively demonstrate the causal relationship, infection (35%), drug intake (17%), and food
ingestion (12%) have all been reported as precipitating
factors in chronic urticaria.

The patients with chronic urticaria were significantly
more atopic compared to the patients with acute urticaria.
Aeroallergens and food sensitivity were present, respectively, in 23.5% and 12% of the chronic urticaria patients
as compared with 5% and 3% of those with acute urticaria (p = 0.17 and p < 0.001, respectively).

One of the most important findings of our study was
the contribution of urinary tract infections in the development of acute urticaria. A number of investigators
have found that antibiotics used for urinary tract infection caused the development of urticaria, the infection
itself not being a factor in the development of the disease (15,16). In our seven patients, however, urinary tract
infection was detected during routine survey, despite the
patients not being on antibiotics at the time of diagnosis.
Furthermore, treatment with antibiotics resulted in clearing of the symptoms. This group consisted of three boys
and four girls with a mean age of 5.21 years (range 3.8—
6.5 years), and of interest is that in five of the seven
patients with urinary tract infections, there were no signs
or symptoms of infection, which suggests that urinalysis
and cultures should be routinely performed in patients
with urticaria.

The percentages of documented infection in patients
with (42%) and without infectious symptoms (46%)
were similar. In addition to urinary tract infection, the
frequency of positive serology for C. pneumoniae and
H. pylori was higher in patients without infectious
symptoms than in those with symptoms. According to the

serologic tests, the relatively high frequency of clinically
silent C. pneumoniae and H. pylori required further
attention. To the best of our knowledge, there have been
no reports documenting an association between urticaria
and C. pneumoniae. Each of these microorganisms has
the ability to cause chronic and asymptomatic infections.

Chlamydia pneumoniae is one of the most widespread
pathogens in man, although up to 90% of infected people
display few or no symptoms. Chronic, latent, and recurrent
infections have been documented, and it is postulated
that disease may be produced as a result of the host’s
immunologic hypersensitivity (17). Recent studies of
otherwise unexplained chronic idiopathic urticaria have
provided evidence that enteric infection with H. pylori
may induce the disease (18-20), though other investigations have produced contradictory results (21,22).

In our study, H. pylori-specific IgG-positive serology
displayed a dominance in the conditions of three patients
in the chronic urticaria group. It was also detected in a
10-year-old boy with acute urticaria. However, none of
these children had clinical symptoms of H. pylori infection. One of the four patients, a 13-year-old boy, had a
positive !3C urea breath test, and endoscopy with a
gastric biopsy confirmed H. pylori colonization. After the
eradication treatment of this entity, he had no more urticaria. He is the youngest patient diagnosed with urticaria
associated with H. pylori. Before defining M. pneumoniae,
C. pneumoniae, and H. pylori as causes of urticaria,
studies surveying the prognosis of urticaria in patients
who are seropositive for such bacteria should be completed and the patients treated using antibiotic therapy,
with the results observed and analyzed.

On the other hand, infection by hepatitis A, B, or C
virus was not detected serologically in any of the study
group patients. It is speculative that bacterial infections
are more common than viral infections among children
with urticaria.

In agreement with the conclusions of Volonakis et al
(6), we found physical urticaria to be the leading suspected cause of chronic urticaria in our study group.
Among physical stimuli, cold and cholinergic urticaria
were more frequently described by our patients. The
data provided by Kranke et al (23) point to H. pylori
infection as a trigger factor in patients with acquired
cold urticaria. Two patients with positive H. pylorispecific IgG described cold as a trigger factor for their
urticaria, but the ice cube-induced urticaria tests of these
patients were negative. In patients describing cold as a
trigger, H. pylori might still be investigated, despite a
negative ice cube test.

The autoimmune diseases were investigated in all
patients with chronic urticaria using the autoantibodies
of ANA, antiDNA, antimicrosomal, and antithyroglobulin

antibodies. Those patients with chronic urticaria all had
negative results. Urticaria linked to autoimmune disease
is very rare in childhood and a specific autoantibody was
not established in any of our study patients. Of course,
our findings do not exclude the possibility that chronic
urticaria may be seen as a presenting symptom complex
of an autoimmune kaleidoscope (24). As shown by
Kaplan (25), Hashimoto disease is the only systemic disorder with a clear and common association with chronic
urticaria and angioedema in adulthood.

Harris et al (26) studied 94 children with chronic urticaria, 2 (2.1%) of whom had associated autoimmunity;
juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in one and arthralgia and a
positive ANA in the other. Dalal et al (24) and Turktas et al
(27) described an association of chronic urticaria in
childhood with autoimmune thyroiditis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Despite limited experience with autoimmunity in chronic urticaria in childhood, the preferred
way is to look for the autoimmune diseases in children
with undetermined etiologies.

In spite of thorough and careful investigations, the
literature suggests that a cause is only generally documented in, at best, 25% of cases of chronic urticaria; the
remainder being labeled chronic idiopathic urticaria (5).
In children, the percentage of documented etiologies
is higher than in adults. Our study demonstrated that
the etiologic factors were not documented in 46% of
patients (20 acute and 8 chronic urticaria patients) and
they were diagnosed as having unexplained idiopathic
urticaria. In 56% of patients in the acute urticaria group
and 53% in the chronic urticaria group, a suspected
clinical or laboratory cause was determined.

With any form of childhood urticaria, the physician
faces a difficult examination in order to find the cause.
Our experiences in this study highlight the effect of
silent infections and physical factors, including cholinergic causes, in addition to those of cold, pressure, and
sun exposure. Drugs and foods are the other frequent
causes that must be investigated. As shown in Table 5,
there are some infections, especially those caused by
bacteria, that need to be revealed. An etiology could be
determined in about half of patients with a detailed questionnaire and laboratory investigations. This observation
orients us toward the use of simpler and more cost
effective laboratory tests for infectious agents, such as
urinalysis and throat culture. All patients should receive
these tests whether they display symptoms suggestive of
infection or not.
