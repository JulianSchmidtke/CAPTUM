Abstract

Introduction: Chronic urticaria is a complex disease process in which chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and chronic
inducible urticaria are distinguished. Its etiopathogenesis still remains unknown. Some recent studies indicated a significant participation of vitamin D in the etiopathogenesis of urticaria. In 40-50% of patients with CSU on the basis of
the positive result of the autologous serum skin test (ASST), autoimmunological background of the disease is diagnosed.
Moreover, numerous test results confirm involvement of the coagulation system/fibrinolysis and non-infectious inflammatory factors in the pathophysiology of CSU.

Aim: To determine whether some factors may play a role in pathogenesis and contribute to the severity of chronic
spontaneous urticaria.
Material and methods: One hundred and forty-two patients with diagnosed CSU were enrolled in the study. The activity
of urticaria was assessed using the UAS-7 (Urticaria Activity Score). The study participants were divided into 4 groups
depending on the UAS-7. ASST was performed and blood was collected to determine the biomarkers (CRP, vitamin D,
D-dimers, fibrinogen, MPV, PLT).

Results: Statistical analysis was performed using Statistica 13. A statistically significant difference between groups with
various activity of urticaria in D-dimer concentration average values (p < 0.05) was observed. Moreover, a statistically

significant negative correlation between activity of urticaria and vitamin D concentration (p < 0.001) was noted.
Conclusions: Our results might support the possible involvement of both coagulation and fibrinolysis pathway and vitamin D in the urticaria pathomechanism. Further prospective studies in larger populations conducted at multiple centres

 

are required to expand further our findings.

Key words: chronic urticaria, vitamin D, coagulation, fibrinolysis.

Introduction

Chronic urticaria is an etiopathologically complex
disease process in which chronic spontaneous urticaria
(CSU) and chronic inducible urticaria are distinguished
[1-3].

Although about 2% of the European population suffers from this disease, its etiopathogenesis still remains
unknown [1, 3, 4]. There are some works indicating a significant participation of vitamin D in the etiopathogenesis of urticaria. Furthermore, in 40-50% of patients with
CSU on the basis of the positive result of the autologous
serum skin test (ASST), an autoimmunological background of the disease is diagnosed [5, 6]. Moreover, numerous test results confirm involvement of the coagulation system/fibrinolysis and non-infectious inflammatory
factor in the pathomechanism of CSU [1, 7-14].

Aim

The aim of the study was to determine whether Creactive protein (CRP), vitamin D, coagulation and fibrinolysis pathway as well as mean platelet volume (MPV)
may play a role in pathogenesis and contribute to the
severity of chronic spontaneous urticaria.

Material and methods

One hundred and forty-two patients (including 108
women and 34 men) with CSU in the active phase at the
age from 19 to 87 were qualified for the study. CSU diagnosis was based on the medical history and clinical
picture of skin lesions. The active phase of the urticaria
was defined as the presence of more than 5 hives that
occurred within 7 days before the beginning of the study.
What is more, all study participants were instructed not

to use any oral antihistamines, corticosteroids or antithrombotic therapy for at least 2 weeks before the beginning of the study. In each patient, on the basis of the
results of consultations (dental, laryngological, urological and gynaecological), the presence of latent inflammatory foci was excluded. On the basis of the imaging
tests, thromboembolism of the lower limbs was excluded
in patients with higher values of D-dimers.

The activity of urticaria was assessed using the UAS7 scale, assigning the obtained results to the following
4 groups: urticaria with a minimal course 1-6, mild 7-15,
medium 16-27 and severe 28-42, according to the guidelines of the EAACI/GA(2)LEN/EDF/WAO [15, 16]. ASST test
was performed in all study participants. A venous blood
sample from cubital fossa was taken for analysis of the
following variables: complete blood count, electrolytes
(Na, K), CRP, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), creatinine, y-glutamyl transferase (GGTP), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), vitamin D,
D-dimer and fibrinogen levels.

 

 

 

 

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was based on the Statistica program
(basic statistics, Student’s t-test, Mann-Whitney test, Spearman correlation, Anova test).

Results

During the performed study, the average UAS-7 value
in 142 subjects was 19.06.

The mean values of UAS-7 in particular groups were
distributed in the following way: group 1— 4.11; group 2
— 11.14; group 3— 21.02; and group 4 — 32.36 (Figure 1).

In the examined group, a statistically significant difference between groups with various activity of urticaria
(defined as UAS-7 value) in D-dimer concentration average values (p < 0.05) was observed (Figure 2). We did
not observe any statistically significant correlation between activity of urticaria (UAS-7 value) and fibrinogen
as well as D-dimer concentration. However, a statistically
significant negative correlation between activity of urticaria and vitamin D concentration (p < 0.001) was noted
(Figure 3).

Ninety-two (65%) study participants had positive
ASST tests and 50 (35%) were ASST negative tested.

In the individuals with a positive ASST test, a statistically non-significant value of the UAS-7 scale (p = 0.58)
and statistically non-significant higher vitamin D concentration (p = 0.305) were found as compared to patients
with a negative ASST result (Figures 4 and 5).

No significant correlation between the mean MPV
values (p = 0.88816) and the PLT number (p = 0.935136)
as well as the UAS-7 value in the examined groups was
confirmed.

In the examined material, no statistically significant
increase (p = 0.16) in fibrinogen concentration with the
increased activity of urticaria was observed (Figure 6).

There was no statistically significant correlation between CRP concentration and activity of urticaria (p =
0.14).

Discussion

Our aim was to determine whether some factors may
play a role in pathogenesis as well as contribute to the
severity of CSU. We have noticed a statistically significant
negative relationship between the urticaria active score
(UAS) and serum level of vitamin D. We have observed
the lowest serum level of vitamin D in patients from
group 4 (with the highest UAS), which is consistent with

610

the recent studies [17-20]. However, Thorp et al. have not
observed a marked association between activity of urticaria and vitamin D serum level. On the basis of analysis
of connections between D-dimer, fibrinogen concentration and UAS we have shown a significant difference
between groups with various activity of urticaria in Ddimer concentration average values. Moreover, we have
observed a positive correlation between urticaria active

score and fibrinogen as well as D-dimer serum level.
Nonetheless, statistically significant relationships were
not observed. Elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen plasma
levels in patients with urticaria suggest activation of
coagulation and fibrinolysis cascade. Our results are in
line with other studies published recently (14, 21-23]. It
is well-established that an increased fibrinogen and Ddimer concentration without concomitant thrombosis is,
as it has been observed in our present study, connected
with activation of the coagulation and fibrinolysis pathway. Such a condition is activated by chronic endothelial
vasculitis during the active phase of urticaria and seems
to be noteworthy [1, 14]. Taking into consideration previous studies, activation of the coagulation cascade resulting in the generation of thrombin, subsequently activates
anti-coagulation and fibrinolysis. Thrombin and other
proteins may play a key role in mast cell degranulation
and result in urticaria. The exact mechanism how the
coagulation, anti-coagulation, fibrinolysis and complement systems act in CSU pathogenesis is required to be
expanded further in future studies [21-23].

Our results regarding a possible relationship between
an inflammation biomarker like CRP and UAS are partly
consistent with the recent data [14, 15, 21, 24, 25]. Additionally, in our study we have noticed that CRP tends
to have higher values (without any inflammation points
in routine imaging like abdominal ultrasonography and
chest X-ray) in the relation to the severity of urticaria
in groups 1-3 of UAS score. The interpretation of such
a finding has been a subject of the debate in many studies published recently, and might be connected with an
increased activity of mast cells in urticaria [8, 21]. However, our study might indicate that CRP increase without
any present inflammation might be a symptom of active endothelial vasculitis with the forced permeability
14]. It is interesting to note that among patients with
a severe form of urticaria we have found an increased
ibrinogen and D-dimer concentration concomitant with
the decrease of CRP values. This outcome seems to be
worth considering. It might indicate that in pathogenesis
of the severe form of urticaria, coagulation and fibrinolysis pathway play a greater role than inflammatory disorder like endothelial vasculitis [14, 26, 27]. According to
the available data, chronic spontaneous urticaria has an
autoimmunological character in over 40-50% of cases
5, 6]. In the present study we have analysed vitamin D
concentration and UAS among patients with both negative and positive ASST, which is known as an indicator
of chronic autoimmune urticaria. Interestingly, we have
shown that the vitamin D serum level was not statistically significantly higher among ASST positive patients in
a comparison with ASST negative patients. This result is
not consistent with previous data of other authors where
there was no relationship between the parameters or,
on the other hand, a statistically significant association

was observed [17, 28]. ASST positive patients presented
amore severe form of urticaria as they had higher UAS-7
values than ASST negative patients. That observation is
in line with previously described results [21, 29, 30].

Our results could not confirm the theory that patients
with a low vitamin D serum level are predisposed to the
evelopment of autoimmune urticaria. However, a series
of studies previously reported reduction of urticaria severity due to vitamin D supplementation among ASST
positive patients. These results might directly support
e involvement of vitamin D in the immune system [17,
31-33]. Interestingly, Chen et al. in their study showed
that vitamin D inhibits plasma B cells differentiation
which also results in suppressing of antibodies secretion
8]. This effect seems to be depending on the number
of receptors for vitamin D on lymphocytes B, and, what
is more, might be concomitant with an increased activy of previously existing lymphocytes B. This condition
might clarify our finding regarding a lower vitamin D
evel among patients with positive ASST in comparison with ASST negative patients. Furthermore, we have
analysed the association between urticaria activity and
MPV. Obtained results were not statistically significant
corresponding with outcomes of Nishimura et al. [34].
However, in some previous studies this relationship was
established, which leaves that matter intriguing [35, 36].

We also have assayed a possible connection between
platelet count and severity of urticaria, but no results
worth considering were found. In conclusion, in the present study we have observed a statistically significant correlation between urticaria activity and vitamin D as well
as a Statistically significant difference between groups
with various activity of urticaria in D-dimer concentration
average values. These results might directly support the
ossible involvement of both coagulation and fibrinolysis
athway and vitamin D in the urticaria pathomechanism
and open new perspectives for a better understanding
of the pathogenesis as well as the treatment of the disease. Moreover, our study may in some measure suggest
hat an increased D-dimer level in patients with severe
urticaria should be considered not only as an indicator
of its activity. A series of studies previously showed that
he elevated D-dimer serum concentration may be regarded as a useful biomarker of worse response to standard treatment by antihistaminic drugs or cyclosporines
7, 37]. Unquestionably, further prospective studies with
evaluation of response to the standard treatment in paients with an increased D-dimer level in larger populaions conducted at multiple centres are required to expand further our findings.
