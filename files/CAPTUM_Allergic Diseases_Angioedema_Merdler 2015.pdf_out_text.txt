Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association
between keratoconus (KC) and common allergic conditions, such as
asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis in a large-scale
database—based epidemiological study.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate the
epidemiologic relationship between KC and allergic diseases. The
study population included all Israeli adolescents who underwent
medical evaluation by the Israeli Defense Force, between the years
2005 and 2013. The presence of KC was determined by corneal
topography read by an ophthalmologist.

Results: A statistically significantly increased odds ratio (OR) for
the presence of KC was found for asthma [OR: 2.0; 95%
confidence interval (CI): 1.6-2.5; P < 0.001], allergic rhinitis
(OR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.3-2.0; P < 0.001), and the combination of
allergic conjunctivitis, chronic blepharitis, and vernal keratoconjunctivitis (AC/CB/VKC), for which a particularly strong association was found (OR: 6.0; 95% Cl: 4.0-9.2; P < 0.001). No
significant association was found between angioedema, urticaria,
history of anaphylaxis, allergy to hymenoptera sting or atopic
dermatitis, and KC. After stratifying the patients according to the
severity of the allergic disease, the association between severe
(AC/CB/VKC) and KC was very high (OR: 36.5; 95% CI:
20.4-65.4; P < 0.001).

Conclusions: In this study, we demonstrated a substantial association between (AC/CB/VKC), asthma, allergic rhinitis, and KC, with
no significant association between other allergic diseases and KC.
The severity of the allergic status is without doubt associated with
a greater risk of having KC. The mechanism causing this association
is still unclear.

K crztcconus (KC) usually appears around the second and
third decades of life and causes deterioration of vision.'*
It is a common corneal disorder, affecting 2.3% of the
population in Israel® and India.’ Prevalence rate differs
geographically with lower rates in other countries such as
Russia (0.003%)’ and the United States (0.5%).*

The etiology of KC still remains unclear.’ Despite the
investigation of various candidate factors such as genetic an
chromosomal disorders and environmental exposure, the
exact cause is still unknown.'° The pathophysiology of the
disease is related to progressive degeneration of all or most 0
the layers, with stromal changes being the most prominent
finding. Previous studies have suggested increased protease
activity as the cause of these changes,'' whereas other studies
have suggested that free radicals,'* formed in the absence o
the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, cause the disease.'*
Despite the fact that KC is not considered an inflammatory
illness, several studies'* have shown overexpression 0
inflammatory cytokines in the tear film of patients with KC.

KC usually progresses over 10 to 20 years until it
stabilizes.'° Progression may vary, but early diagnosis may
lead to a better prognosis. Treatment of KC depends on the
severity of the disease. Therapies are aimed at either
improving the refractive status or at changing corneal biomechanics, thus halting disease progression.'° Refractive
treatments range from spectacles and soft contact lenses in
mild cases to rigid contact lenses and intracorneal ring
segments. Therapies proven to halt disease progression
include corneal collagen cross-linking and keratoplasty. In
severe cases, where scarring and fibrosis exist, keratoplasty
serves both as an optical/refractive treatment and as a means
to halt disease progression.'*

Allergic diseases,'° such as asthma, atopic dermatitis,
and allergic rhinitis, are characterized by a hypersensitivity
reaction to an allergen. These diseases are very common, with
prevalence estimated as 13% of the American population for
asthma,'’ 17% for atopic dermatitis, and up to 16% for
allergic rhinitis.'* KC has been shown to be associated with
allergic diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis.'?
However, the studies that examined this association used
a relatively small sample size”?! or found a relatively weak
association.'®

Allergic conjunctivitis (AC),?° with signs and symptoms ranging from simple intermittent tearing, itching, or
hyperemia to severe sight-threatening corneal complications,
affects approximately 25% of the world population. Vernal
keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a seasonally exacerbated

allergic inflammation of the ocular surface, involving tarsal and/
or bulbar conjunctiva particularly seen among children and
young adults living in regions with hot and dry climate, such as
the Middle East. Several studies”? have demonstrated substantially higher severity of KC in patients who also have VEC
or AC. It has been presumed that excessive eye rubbing might
exacerbate KC.*' Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), specifically
MMP-2 and MMP-9, also known as gelatinases, are enzymes
involved in normal epithelial turnover and are normally present
in the tear film.?* Overexpression of these enzymes results in
excessive extracellular matrix degradation and tissue destruction. MMP-2 originates mainly from activated fibroblasts
during the course of wound healing, and MMP-9 is expressed
mainly by regenerating epithelial cells and is involved in
recruiting inflammatory cells to the wound area.”* The involvement of T cells, which infiltrate the conjunctiva in AC,™ in the
expression and regulation of MMPs”** may lead to an increase
in the rate of epithelial turnover and expression of MMP-9,
possibly contributing to the pathogenesis of KC.

A 7-year, retrospective, observational case-control
study by Nemet et al,'° published in 2010, examined the
association of KC with allergic and autoimmune diseases
among 426 patients diagnosed with KC and 1704 age- and
gender-matched controls. A mildly (yet statistically significant) increased odds ratio (OR) among KC cases was found
for asthma and environmental allergy, as well as various
autoimmune disorders, when compared with controls.

It is unclear what exactly links allergic diseases and
KC. Corneal injury caused by excessive eye rubbing
secondary to allergy has been suggested as a possible
mechanism. However, the findings of Nemet et al,'° which
linked autoimmune diseases with KC, are not explained by
this hypothesis. Our study was conducted to evaluate the link
between KC and various allergic diseases, to quantify the risk
of KC in patients with these diseases, and to compare the risk
of KC between different types of allergic diseases.

 

METHODS

We conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate the
epidemiologic relationship between KC and allergic diseases.

Source of Data

As a part of the military preconscription assessment,
most Israeli civilians undergo a routine medical evaluation
and fitness-for-service (FFS) classification at a prespecified
age. The medical evaluation includes questionnaires filled by
the candidate and his family physician and a physical
examination including anthropometrics, vital signs, and visual
acuity measurements, a physical examination by a physician,
as well as further tests and consultations deemed required by
the physician. A candidate is referred to an ophthalmology
specialist in cases of known ocular history, reduced visual
acuity, any complaint of qualitative visual change, a recent
change in refraction, or any other relevant finding in
anamnesis or physical examination.

A referral for corneal topography is made at the
discretion of the examining ophthalmologist. At the conclusion

of this process, one or more FFS classification numerical codes
indicative of both a medical diagnosis (or similar diagnoses
grouped by pathogenesis) and a functional status, as fit for
combat duty or not, are stored in the candidate’s personal and
medical record. From the conscripts’ medical records, we
retrieved demographic details (gender, FFS determination date,
and age at that time) and FFS codes. AC, VKC, and chronic
blepharitis (CB) are all represented by the same FFS numerical
codes in the examinees’ records and therefore were grouped
in our analysis as well.

An FFS code consistent with KC diagnosis and severity
is given based on the above-described ophthalmologic
examination and corneal topography. The study was
approved by the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) institutional
review board, and the subjects’ anonymity was strictly kept.

Study Population

The study population included all Israeli teenagers who
underwent medical evaluation by the IDF as part of the
preconscription assessment between January 2005 and
December 2013. We excluded subjects who were younger
than 16 years and those who were older than 20 years at the
time of their medical evaluation because these subjects
underwent the conscription process outside the standard
conscription age range and therefore were prone to differ
from the regular conscripts in terms of socioeconomic status
and health care access. Moreover, their number was very
small (<0.1% of the entire cohort).

Statistical Analysis

All data were summarized and displayed as mean
(£SD) for continuous variables and as number (percentage)
of patients in each group for categorical variables. Continuous
variables were compared using the independent sample ¢ test
or ANOVA (the Scheffe test was used for post hoc multiple
comparison), whereas categorical variables were compared
using a x? test and binary logistic regression models.

Based on the presence of the corresponding FFS code,
we grouped the KC FFS functional status (fit and unfit for
combat duty) into 1 KC group. We then divided the entire
study cohort into 2 groups: cases (of the respective allergic
condition tested) and controls (without the respective allergic
condition tested). Then, we divided both cases and controls
into 2 groups of KC cases and controls in a similar manner,
yielding a 2 x 2 table. We calculated the OR, confidence
interval (CI), and statistical significance for the presence of
the tested allergic condition between KC cases and controls.
A multivariate analysis was performed to assess the specific
relationship between asthma and KC while neutralizing
confounding variables as age, gender, conscription year,
and the presence of other allergic conditions.

We calculated the OR between KC and the different
levels of functioning status of the allergic conditions to
achieve a semi dose-response analysis.

A 2-tailed P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant; the assumed prevalence of the allergic condition
in the KC group was 20% and the assumed prevalence of the

allergic condition in the general population was 15%, which
yields a study power of 95.5%. All analyses were performed
with SPSS 21.0 software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).

RESULTS

Of the final sample of 662,644 examinees (age 17.5
years; 60% male), 807 (0.1%) were diagnosed with KC based
on assignment of the corresponding numerical code. The
exact diagnostic criteria of each disease and its prevalence are
described in Tables 1 and 2.

A demographic analysis of the 807 patients with KC
showed that the mean body mass index was 23.2, 61.5%
were male, and the mean age was 17.5 years. The
association between the various allergic conditions mentioned above and KC is described in Table 3A; a statistically
significant increased OR for the presence of KC was found
for asthma (OR: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.6-2.5; P < 0.001), allergic
thinitis (OR: 1.6; 95% Cl: 1.3-2.0; P < 0.001), and the
combination of AC/CB/VKC (OR: 6.0; 95% Cl: 4.0-9.2;

 

KC and Common Allergic Conditions

P < 0.001). No significant association was found between
angioedema, urticaria, history of anaphylaxis, allergy to
hymenoptera sting or atopic dermatitis, and KC. After
correction for age, gender conscription year, and other
allergic diseases, a statistically significant increased OR
for the presence of KC was found for both asthma (OR: 1.5;
95% CI: 1.3-1.6 P < 0.001) and AC/CB/VKC (OR: 5.4;
95% CI: 3.2-7.6 P < 0.001).

After stratifying the different allergic conditions for
the functional status, we found that the OR for KC in the
“non-limiting for combat duties” functional status allergic
conditions was generally lower than the OR between KC
and the same allergic conditions in a limiting for combat
duty functional status (Table 3). This difference was
statistically significant only in asthma: nonlimiting asthma
(OR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.2-2.5; P = 0.005), limiting asthma (OR:
2.3; 95% Cl: 1.8-3.0; P < 0.001), and AC/CB/VKC:
nonlimiting AC/CB/VKC (OR: 3.2; 95% Cl: 1.7-5.7; P =
0.001), limiting AC/CB/VKC (OR: 36.5; 95% CI:
20.4-65.4; P < 0.001).

DISCUSSION

KC is a progressive corneal ectasia with an incidence of
approximately 0.1% in the general American population. Its
prevalence in the Israeli adolescent population, according to
our study, is estimated as 0.1% with a slight male predominance (61.5%).

Although the cross-sectional design of this study and
lack of data in the FFS codes about the age of diagnosis do
not allow any reasoning regarding causality, the earlier
incidence age of AC, CB, VKC, and asthma®®*’ compared
with KC, provides a basis to the hypothesis that those
diseases, which usually appear earlier than KC, may contribute to the development of KC rather than vice versa.

In this study, we demonstrated a substantial association
between AC/CB/VKC, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and KC with
no significant association with other allergic diseases. In light
of the high OR of 6.0 for the presence of KC among patients
with AC/CB/VKC, it may be beneficial to screen such
patients for the presence of KC. Considering the young age
typical of VKC and the progressive course of pediatric KC,"
such screening may be especially beneficial for pediatric
patients, allowing early detection and disease-modifying

treatments such as corneal cross-linking, which has been
shown to be effective in halting disease progression.'*

Our statistical analysis shows that the severity of the
allergic status is without doubt linked to a greater risk of
having KC. We were unable to find substantial data in the
literature regarding this association. This association
between allergic pathology severity and KC is consistent
with our hypothesis—a stronger allergic reaction would
increase the risk of KC. This is especially true regarding AC/
CB/VKC. However, the mechanism causing this association
remains unclear.

It seems that patients with AC/CB/VKC would benefit
from being evaluated for the development of KC. When
generalizing the findings of this study, it should be noted that
KC in allergic patients may represent a separate disease
entity, as suggested by the steeper and thinner cones and

inferior displacement of corneal apices, compared with
patients with KC with no allergic disease.*”
We recognize several limitations in our study design.

First, the fact that this is a retrospective cross-sectional
study prevents us from deducing about temporal related
issues. We strongly believe that having an allergic disease
such as AC, VKC, or CB is a risk factor for developing KC
later on in life, but further studies are required to investigate
this. Second, the data from this study were retrieved from
the FFS codes of the IDF. These codes are used to
determine medical fitness, and as such, they sometime
group similar diseases into 1 FFS code, such as the code for
AC/CB/VKC.

In conclusion, our findings suggest that AC, VKC, and
CB should all be considered risk factors for KC. Close
follow-up and even screening for the development of KC
should be considered in those patients. Further studies should
be done to better understand the exact mechanism and to
further refine the difference in disease characteristics among
patients with KC in relation to atopy.
