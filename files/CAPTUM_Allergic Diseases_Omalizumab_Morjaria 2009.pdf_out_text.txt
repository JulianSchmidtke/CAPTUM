Off-label use of omalizumab
in non-asthma conditions:
new opportunities

Expert Rev. Resp. Med. 3(3), 299-308 (2009)

Allergic diseases are mediated by IgE and, hence, neutralizing IgE to attenuate type |
hypersensitivity reactions may result in clinical benefits. This has been mainly established in
several large pre- and postmarketing studies of the humanized monoclonal anti-IgE antibody,
omalizumab, in patients with allergic asthma. In this patient population, omalizumab has been

IgE plays a pivotal role in the development of
allergic conditions [1]. In genetically susceptible
individuals, environmental exposure to certain potential allergens is known to trigger the
immune response, specifically by inducing amplification in the synthesis of IgE (2}. The resultant
allergen-specific IgE binds to the effector cells via
high-affinity (FceRI) and low-affinity (FceRI;
CD23) receptors. Cross-linking of IgE molecules
induces the degranulation of mast cells and basophils to liberate both preformed and newly generated mediators [2], which consequently cause
an acute/early-phase reaction owing to direct
mediator release, and a late-phase reaction due
to the recruitment of inflammatory cells into
the tissue. FceRI receptors are predominantly
expressed on mast cells, basophils and antigenpresenting cells, while FegRII receptors are more
common on B cells, eosinophils, alveolar macrophages, T cells, Langerhans and dendritic cells,

 

platelets and neutrophils 3-6]. Of note, IgE is
generated by B cells under the influence of two

cytokines: IL-4 and IL-13, which are produced
by several cell types, inducing Th2 cells, a subset
of T-helper lymphocytes ubiquitous in atopy [7.8].

Therefore, anti-IgE drugs may be of some
value in IgE-mediated diseases, and particularly for those patients who continue to suffer
from severe uncontrolled allergic conditions,
despite intensive standard treatment. This has
led to clinical trials of specific agents aimed at
antagonizing IgE. Omalizumab, a recombinant
humanized IgG1 noncomplement-fixing monoclonal antibody that binds to the high-affinity
receptor-binding domain (CH,) on the Fe portion of free IgE met the ideal requirements for the
neutralization of IgE antibodies in humans. The
beneficial effect of omalizumab has been firmly
established in patients with allergic asthma
(9-22], and current treatment guidelines suggest
that this drug should be instituted in a patient
with severe allergic asthma with symptoms that
remain uncontrolled despite standard intensive
therapy [101].

However, IgE has also been implicated in a number of other
conditions including allergic rhinitis (AR; seasonal and perennial),
peanut allergy, latex sensitivity, atopic dermatitis (AD), chronic urticaria (CU) and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA).
Therefore, anti-IgE treatment can be used as a possible treatment
modality for these conditions, and particularly for those severe
unremitting cases who fail to respond to intensive standard treatment.

The purpose of this article is to evaluate recent information
concerning the potential value of IgE blockade in clinical trials
of IgE-related conditions. However, a number of caveats must
be considered to properly interpret the findings presented here.
Most of the studies, with a few exceptions, are open-label studies,
generally with a small number of patients and of short duration.

Allergic rhinitis

Allergic rhinitis isa common condition that affects at least 10-15%
of the population globally and is typically classified into intermittent
(seasonal) or persistent (perennial) [23]. Both types are mediated
by IgE. Although AR is not frequently associated with increased
morbidity and mortality, it does significantly impact on the quality
of life (QoL) of patients, and several difficult-to-treat forms develop
into chronic rhinosinusitis [24]. There have been numerous clinical
trials of omalizumab in AR (both seasonal and perennial); some
of them have also been carried out in the presence of comorbidities
(i.e., allergic asthma) whereas a few others together with another
form of allergic treatment (i.e., allergen immunotherapy). This section presents an overview of these trials. A summary of these studies
and their outcomes is presented in Tastes 1 & 2.

Seasonal AR trials

Adelroth et al. conducted a randomized, multicenter, double-blind,
placebo-controlled (DBPC) trial using omalizumab for 8 weeks
in 251 adults with seasonal AR (SAR) with a positive skin test
for birch pollen [25]. Subjects with a baseline serum IgE of up to
150 IU/ml received 300 mg omalizumab or placebo at baseline
(week 0) and week 4, while those with a serum IgE level greater
than 150 IU/ml received 300 mg of omalizumab or placebo at
baseline, and at weeks 3 and 6. The primary efficacy variable was
the subject's average nasal symptom score (sneezing, itchy nose,
runny nose, stuffy nose, itchy eyes, watery eyes and red eyes), and
secondary efficacy variables included rescue antihistamine use per
day, proportion of days with SAR medication use and Junipers
Rhinoconjunctivitis-specific QoL (RQLQ) (26). In the omalizumab
group, significant reductions in the nasal symptom severity score,
ocular symptoms severity score and use of rescue antihistamines,
as well as RQLQ score were reported. Likewise, serum-free IgE
levels were markedly lowered in the omalizumab group and were
associated with clinical effectiveness. No serious adverse events were
noted and there were equal rates of minor adverse events (mainly
injection-site reactions and localized urticaria).

Ina second large multicenter study of 536 subjects with moderateto-severe ragweed-induced SAR designed to assess the efficacy and
safety of omalizumab for prevention of allergic symptoms, subjects were randomized to receive omalizumab, 50 mg (n = 137),

150 mg (n = 134), 300 mg (n = 136) or placebo (n = 136) 2 weeks

prior to the ragweed season and administration of the drug was
repeated during the pollen season based on baseline IgE levels
(IgE levels 151-700 IU/ml received four treatments [at 0, 3, 6 and
9 weeks]) [27]. A significant increase in nasal symptom severity scores
was observed in the placebo group, whereas no increase was reported
in the omalizumab 300 mg group. In addition, there were significant reductions in rescue medication use and consistently improved
Junipers RQLQ scores in the 300 mg omalizumab group compared
with the placebo group. Although the other two doses of omalizumab (50 mg and 150 mg) in the trial had some positive effects on
the parameters measured, not all were significant. The incidence of
adverse events was not significantly different among study groups.

A follow-on open-labeled investigation of the study by Casale
etal. 27\ described previously was then conducted in 287 patients
to evaluate the safety and tolerability of re-administering omalizumab in the same administration protocol during a second season of ragweed pollen [28]. This open-labeled study confirmed
the mild nature of the adverse events and the efficacy outcomes
as in the primary study.

Inamore recent Japanese DBPC study, 100 subjects with moderateto-severe Japanese Cedar pollen-induced SAR were recruited to receive
omalizumab (150, 225, 300 or 375 mg) or placebo for 12 weeks [29].
Treatment was initiated at least 1 month before the expected pollen
season. Significantly lower nasal symptoms scores, ocular symptom
scores and daily rescue medication scores were observed in the omalizumab group. Akin to other studies, there were marked reductions
in serum-free IgE levels and a similar mild adverse reactions profile.

Perennial AR trials

Omalizumab also proved to be beneficial in perennial AR (PAR).
In their DBPC trial, Chervinsky er a/. studied the efficacy,
safety and tolerability of omalizumab in 289 moderate-to-severe
PAR [30]. Subjects were randomized to receive omalizumab (at
least 0.016 mg/kg/IgE [IU/ml]; n = 144) or placebo (n = 145)
over 16 weeks. Not only was there a significantly reduced mean
daily nasal severity score and reduction on rescue antihistamine
use, but Junipers RQLQ scores in the omalizumab group compared with placebo throughout the trial period were also substantially reduced. Omalizumab was well-tolerated, with similar mild
adverse events to SAR trials.

Allergic asthma and AR have been reported to coexist with associated elevated serum IgE levels and an analogous pathophysiology
can be inferred for both conditions (23,31,32]. Therefore, patients with
PAR and asthma comorbidity may represent a reasonable target
group for treatment with anti-IgE agents [33,34]. Based on this premise, along with the WHO-sponsored Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact
on Asthma (ARIA) workshop report, a DBPC study of omalizumab
in subjects with concomitant asthma and rhinitis (6QLAR) was conducted [35]. This multicentered 28-week trial recruited 405 subjects
with moderate-to-severe asthma and coexistent PAR. Fewer asthma
exacerbations together with clinically significant improvements in
RQLQ and asthma-related QoL scores [36], and the composite
asthma/rhinitis scores were observed in the omalizumab-treated
subjects compared with placebo. Overall, there were no significant
differences between the treatment groups in adverse events.

Trials from combination of omalizumab & specific
immunotherapy in SAR

Allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) is an important therapy
for the symptomatic management of allergic disorders [37-39],
and it is the sole antigen-specific immunomodulatory treatment routinely available to clinicians. Furthermore, SIT shows

long-term benefits against allergic symptoms and appears to
alter the natural course of allergic diseases by preventing the
progression of neosentisization and asthma [39-41].

According toARIA guidelines, patients with persistent disease,
moderate-to-severe symptoms and unresponsiveness to standard
treatment should be considered for SIT [42]. SIT may be effective

both in AR and allergic asthma, when adequate doses of standardized allergen extract are administered [43]. However, there
are safety issues with the use of SIT, especially with regard to the
treatment of anaphylactic reactions (<1%) [44].

Kuehr et al. conducted a randomized, double-blind study to
evaluate the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in 221 subjects
with SAR commencing on SIT [4s]. Each subject was initiated on
their allergen-specific SIT as per standard recommendation and,
prior to the anticipated pollen seasons (24 weeks), they were then
initiated and maintained on either omalizumab or placebo. SIT
plus omalizumab-treated subjects were not only were reported
to have a 48% reduction in allergen-induced symptom load over
two pollen seasons, but they also had substantially lower rescue
medication use and allergic symptoms compared with SIT plus
placebo. A post hoc sub-analysis of this study to assess the effects of

each treatment (i.e., SIT or omalizumab) demonstrated that SIT
alone did not significantly reduce either symptom severity score
or rescue medication, whereas anti-IgE monotherapy did [46].
Hence, combination therapy may be complimentary, providing
the superior effect compared with individual treatments.

Kopp e¢ al. investigated the role of add-on omalizumab to SIT
in 92 subjects with birch- and grass pollen-induced SAR [47].
Subjects were randomized in a double-blind fashion into four
groups: two groups each treated with SIT to birch and grass
pollen, respectively. After 12 weeks of standard treatment with
SIT, either omalizumab or placebo was added for 24 weeks.
Combination treatment of omalizumab and SIT grass or SIT
birch resulted in a lower symptom load during the pollen season
compared with placebo. Furthermore, similar significant changes
were noted in the daily medication use and ocular symptoms. A

sub-analysis of this study was conducted to evaluate the effect of
omalizumab on nasal inflammation in patients allergic to birch
and grass pollen treated with SIT [48]. It was reported that SIT
combined with omalizumab prevented a rise in nasal eosinophilic
cationic protein and decreased tryptase levels during the pollen
season. At the same time, symptom severity and rescue medication
use decreased significantly, confirming the results of the primary
study [47].

Trials from combination of omalizumab & rush
immunotherapy in SAR

Rush immunotherapy (RIT) is commonly used for venom treatment. However, as with SIT, there are safety issues associated
with RIT, particularly the risk of anaphylactic reactions that
are much higher than in SIT, ranging from less than 5 to over
65% [44,49-s1]. As a result of the expedited dosing regimen, early
increases in total and specific IgE levels have been observed in
RIT {s2] and these rises may predispose patients to allergic reactions during the subsequent build-up and early maintenance phase
of immunotherapy (IT).

Casale et al. conducted a study to elucidate the extent to which
pretreatment with omalizumab would be effective in enhancing both the safety and efficacy of RIT [53]. In this multicenter
DBPC study, 159 subjects with pre-existing ragweed AR were
randomized into four groups of pretreatment with 9 weeks of
omalizumab (0.016 mg/kg/IgE [IU/ml]/month) or placebo. This
was followed by a 1-day rush of ragweed (1-2 Hg of the major
allergen Amb al) or placebo IT, and then continuing on omalizumab or placebo while the dose of ragweed was increased on
a weekly basis to 12 pg Amb al. Of the 123 subjects who completed all the treatments, it was reported that subjects on RIT
plus omalizumab had fewer adverse events compared with RIT

 

alone, with an overall fivefold reduction in anaphylaxis (odds
ratio: 0.17; p = 0.026). Furthermore, subjects on the combination
treatment had a significant improvement in severity scores during the ragweed season. compared with RIT alone. As expected,
there was also a substantial reduction in serum IgE levels, and
a more than 11-fold increase in ragweed-specific IgG levels in
the IT patients. Hence, this proof-of-concept study confirmed
the hypothesis that reduction of free IgE would improve the
safety and efficacy of RIT. A follow-on extension study was conducted by Klunker e¢ a/. to better understand the mec
underlying these effects (54). They reported that IT resulted in a
significant allergen—IgE binding inhibition at 5-19 weeks com
anisms

 

pared with baseline. Furthermore, elevation in allergen-specific
IgG4 levels was present after IT, irrespective of whether anti-IgE
treatment was used or not; the combined treatment manifested
the induction of a long-lasting inhibiting antibody function of
up to 42 weeks compared with either treatments. This would
be explained by the fact that ragweed IT induced regulatory
antibodies that partially antagonized allergen—IgE complexes
binding to B cells and that treatment with omalizumab totally
antagonized allergen—IgE binding via inhibition of IgE binding
to CD23. Therefore, the combined treatments may contribute
to the enhanced efficacy reported.

 

Peanut allergy

There is an increasing incidence of allergy to specific foods,
leading to increased public awareness. Approximately 2% of the
population in USA have a food allergy, and peanut- and tree
nut-induced anaphylaxis causes 50-100 deaths each year [55,56].
It is mainly children who develop extreme sensitivity to peanuts,
which is frequently due to accidental ingestion [57]. Meticulous
avoidance of the offending food is the treatment, and patients are
recommended to have a prefilled epinephrine syringe with them
in case of accidental ingestion.

A recent proof-of-concept study by Leung et al. was conducted
to establish the efficacy of anti-IgE therapy, using TNX-901 (a
humanized monoclonal antibody against IgE), in 84 subjects
with a history of immediate hypersensitivity to peanuts [58].
Hypersensitivity was established and the threshold of encapsulated peanut flow measured using an oral challenge at screening
prior to being randomized in a double-blind fashion of 3:1 to
receive TNX-901 (150 mg, 300 mg and 450 mg) or placebo every
4 weeks for four doses. It was reported that the threshold sensidose-dependently
raised from approximately half a peanut (~178 mg) to over nine
peanuts (~2805 mg) in the treated group compared with placebo.
Hence, although TNX-901 does not offer complete protection, it

tivity to peanut allergen was significantly an

may reduce the susceptibility to severe anaphylaxis to involuntary
peanut allergen exposure in particularly sensitive patients.

In another Phase II clinical trial of similar design, omalizumab
was prematurely terminated as a result of safety concerns, as a
few patients developed severe hypersensitivity reactions during
the pretreatment oral challenges [59]. Despite this disappointing

 

outcome, studies with a different design will be launched in the
near future.

Latex sensitivity
Some individuals are sensitive to natural rubber latex (NRL)
and products derived from it. This is a common problem among
healthcare workers 60,61], and susceptible individuals develop
pulmonary and dermatological symptoms [62]. Latex sensitivity
is thought to be due to IgE specific to NRL proteins. Avoidance
of NRL and derivatives is the only treatment measure, but IT to
NRL proteins has shown some efficacy [63].
In a recent small, double-blind Phase I study, Leynadier etal.
investigated the effect of lowering IgE levels on latex allergy by
using omalizumab [64]. They recruited 18
well-documente

ealthcare workers with
latex hypersensitivity and randomized them to
receive either omalizumab or placebo. Efficacy was evaluated by
conjunctival challenge and skin testing to NRL extracts after 8
and 16 weeks of treatment. It was reported that the mean conjunctival challenge test score significantly decreased from 10.0
to 5.0 during omalizumab therapy, as opposed to 9.67 to 9.0 in
the placebo group. Furthermore, at 16 weeks, four subjects in the
omalizumab group had a negative score compared with none in
the placebo. In the extension open-labeled phase, eight out of the
nine patients (88.9%) previously randomized to placebo and the
remaining patients in the previously omalizumab group had a negative conjunctival challenge test score (response rate 93.8% [15,16]).

Morjaria & Polosa

In total, 11 out of 15 subjects had a negative latex glove challenge on study completion. This initial observation suggests that
omalizumab may have indication for latex hypersensitivity.

Atopic dermatitis

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by itchy cutaneous lesions, and is known to be frequently
associated with allergic asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis [65,66].
Elevated serum IgE levels are often noted. Although the diagnosis of AD is straightforward, most cases of moderate-to- severe
AD do not respond satisfactorily to any single treatment, and
many management strategies are limited by systemic toxicities.
Anecdotal reports have shown satisfactory clinical response to
omalizumab in severe refractory AD [67,68].

An initial case series involving three adults with AD with elevated
serum IgE levels reported the failure of omalizumab to improve
their chronic lichenified eczema or reduce symptomatic flares [69].
On the other hand, a recent open-labeled prospective study investigating the efficacy of omalizumab in 21 moderate-to-severe adult
AD patients with persistent allergic asthma and elevated serum
IgE levels (up to 8396 IU/ml) has reported positive findings, with
all the patients experiencing clinically and statistically significant
improvement of their AD [70]. Hence, antagonizing IgE may be an
effective treatment strategy in patients with severe refractory AD.

Chronic urticaria
Chronic urticaria is suggested to have an autoimmune basis in
approximately 50% of cases, most commonly associated with the
presence of IgG autoantibodies directed to the a-subunit of the
IgE receptor. Cross-linking of the a-subunits result in activation
and degranulation of basophils and skin mast cells [71-73]. CU is a
challenging clinical condition that it is often resistant to available
treatments [74]. Anecdotal reports have shown fast and complete
resolution of urticaria with omalizumab in refractory CU [75].
Furthermore, in a case of cold-induced urticaria, omalizumab
resolved the patient’s urticaria and associated manifestations, with
improvement already noted soon after the second injection [76].
Kaplan et al. have recently carried out a proof-of-concept study
investigating the efficacy of omalizumab in patients with chronic
autoimmune urticaria refractory to intensive antihistamine therapy (77]. Subjects were treated with placebo for 4 weeks followed by
omalizumab for 16 weeks. It was reported that the mean Urticaria
Activity Score (UAS) decreased significantly from baseline with
omalizumab. Of the 12 patients, seven had complete symptom resolution, and in foura significant reduction in UAS was reported; only
one patient failed to respond to omalizumab. Furthermore, there
were overall reductions in the rescue medication use and improvement in QoL. No serious adverse effects were noted. The findings of
this exploratory study should prompt the evaluation of the potential
pathological role of IgE and its receptor in various types of CU.

Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis

Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a hypersensitivity reaction in the airways due to exposure to a ubiquitous fungi of the
Aspergillus species, most commonly Aspergillus fumigatus [78-80].

For most individuals, this causes no harm, but for those with
predisposing lung disease (such as cystic fibrosis [CF]) or with
suppressed immune system, A. fumigatus can colonize the airways and trigger a potent inflammatory response with elevated
IgE levels. Prevalence of ABPA ranges from 1 to 15% in patients
with CF [81,82].

Systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment, but adding antifungal agents may results in IgE and corticosteroid dose
reduction, as well as in improvement in lung function [83]. Longterm use of corticosteroids has the potential to induce significant
detrimental side effects, particularly in children [84]. Case series
and anecdotal reports of the use of omalizumab in ABPA have
shown sustained improvement in respiratory symptoms and lung
function, and discontinuation of systemic corticosteroids [85-87].
This suggests that IgE blockage by anti-IgE drugs may hold
promise as a beneficial strategy to control ABPA in corticosteroiddependent individuals. Importantly, the use of anti-IgE therapy
may probably be beneficial in subjects without CF, and future
trials should be considered in subjects with steroid-dependent
ABPA, with or without CF, as well as looking at changes to the
airways as a result of treatment.

Eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disorders
Eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs) are a spectrum of conditions that are increasingly being diagnosed. Among
those diagnosed, approximately 75% of the patients are atopic, with
high prevalence of positive skin tests for food allergen. EGIDs may
involve eosinophilic esophagitis, gastroenteritis and colitis [88,89].
It has been suggested that this food allergen-driven eosinophilic
inflammation may have a pivotal role in the disease process.
Recently, it has been reported that omalizumab treatment
in patients with EGIDs results in significant improvements in
symptom scores and an increase in the threshold concentration
of allergen in terms of basophil activation, skin test wheal and
erythema [90]. It was reported that there was marked reduction
in the gastrointestinal biopsy eosinophil, basophil and dendritic
cells, as well as systemic total IgE and eosinophil counts, hence
demonstrating a potential role of anti-IgE therapy in EGIDS.

Expert commentary
Despite the unquestionable efficacy of standard treatments for
most patients with AR, peanut allergy, latex sensitivity, AD, CU
and ABPA, a number of patients remain with serious unremitting
symptoms, with considerable impact on QoL and disproportionate use of healthcare resources. The reported success of the offlabel use of omalizumab in the management of these difficult
cases is an important finding, suggesting unique opportunities
for the treatment of several IgE-related diseases, particularly for
those who are refractory to intensive standard therapy.
However, larger controlled trials are clearly needed to confirm
these initial observations and better characterize which individual
patient would benefit most from such a therapeutic strategy. In
addition, a number of issues relating to the dosing regimen, including the need for long-term maintenance therapy, and interactions
with the regular therapies should be addressed.

While it may be justified to initiate a therapeutic trial with
omalizumab in severely affected patients with refractory AD,
ABPA or food allergy without exposing these subjects to a considerable risk, it must be noted that health insurance companies
and re-imbursers usually refuse to cover expenses for off-label
therapies. It should also be noted that, despite the improvements
seen in various conditions, there are numerous unanswered questions as to the mechanistic role of anti-IgE in such conditions.
Future studies should try to establish these mechanisms beside
the clinical benefits of anti-IgE therapy.

Although omalizumab has a well-established safety record,
with the most common adverse event being injection-site reactions, there have been possible warnings of malignancies and
anaphylaxis with the use of omalizumab (91). With regards to the
risk of malignancy, a 5-year postmarketing surveillance study
(the EXCELS study: an epidemiological study of omalizumab,
which addresses the specific issue of the risk of cancer associated
with omalizumab therapy) involving 7500 patients is currently
ongoing. Concerning the risk of anaphylaxis, it has been recently
recommended that the drug must be administered in healthcare
settings where anaphylaxis can be managed, and that patients
should be observed for 2 h after the first omalizumab injection and
for 30 min after subsequent omalizumab
treatments [92].

Overall, omalizumab is well-tolerated, as
shown in various clinical trials extending
up to 1 year, but safety data beyond this
needs to be verified. Despite this, physicians should consider the possibility of prescribing omalizumab for unremitting IgErelated conditions, even in the face of the
high acquisition cost of omalizumab and
the obvious pharmacoeconomic concerns.

for non-asthma conditions. It is also possible that the list of clinical indications for which anti-IgE agents can be used may well
expand to include the unremitting forms of several other chronic
inflammatory diseases (e.g., eosinophilic bronchitis refractory to
standard treatment) in the not-too-distant future.

If relevant safety and efficacy data from large controlled clinical trials of adequately characterized patients with severe refractory disease are generated, it will be acceptable for health insurance companies and re-imbursers to cover expenses for anti-IgE
therapies for these challenging conditions.

However, exclusive health economic analyses will be required to
support the cost—effectiveness of omalizumab in these highly targeted patient populations with inadequately controlled severe IgErelated disease that is refractory to intensive standard treatment.

articular antigens, its clinical efficacy is based on its ability antagonize IgE responses
to superantigens, especially in subjects with more than one allergic precipitant.

¢ Antagonizing IgE does not have a high profile of severe adverse events, but in
omalizumab-treated individuals, higher rates of anap
redisposition and/or malignancies compared with controls have been reported.
Hence, more vigilance and precautions should be in place in the use of omalizumab.
Although the various studies and case reports show that omalizumab confers good
efficacy in allergic conditions, its costs need to be balanced with its benefits and
