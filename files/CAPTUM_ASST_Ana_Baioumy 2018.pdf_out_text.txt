ARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT

 

Keywords: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a chronic type characterized by episodes of wheals with or without
ASST angioedema. Autoantibody against the alpha subunit of Fc epsilon receptor (FceRIa) was detected in CSU paAPST tients’ sera. The study aims to evaluate the clinical utility of skin tests in CSU patients. In addition, it assesses the
Autoantibody presence of circulating FceRla in CSU patients and their correlation with other clinical and immunological
aoe variables. The study includes 40 healthy controls and 40 CSU patients who had urticaria symptoms for at least 8

weeks. All subjects underwent the following tests: autologous serum skin test (ASST), autologous plasma skin
test (APST), immunoglobulin E (IgE), antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antithyroid antibodies (ATA). An in-house
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for FceRla detection. The prevalence of ANA and ATA in CSU was
7.5% and 20% respectively. Total IgE was significantly higher in CSU than in controls (p < 0.0001). The study
detected circulating antibody to FceRla in 2.5% of controls and 52.5% of CSU patients (p < 0.0001). The
prevalence of antibody to FceRla was 27.3% and 83.3% of ASST negative and positive patients respectively
(p = 0.0004). But the prevalence was 17.6% and 78.3% of APST negative and positive patients respectively
(p = 0.0002). In conclusion, Circulating antibody to FceRIa has a role in the pathogenic mechanisms of CSU.

 

1. Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a chronic type characterized
by episodes of wheals with or without angioedema. CSU has a recurrent
course which lasts more than 6 weeks (Lima et al., 2017). CSU may
have an autoimmune pathogenesis (Sabroe et al., 1999).

Immunoglobulin E (IgE) binds to the Fc epsilon receptor (FceR) to
mediate its action. The high-affinity FceRI is expressed on the cell
surface (eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, and Langerhans cells) (Kraft
and Kinet, 2007). Allergic reactions to allergens are mediated by histamine release when allergen binds to surface-bound IgE on mast cells
(Hayes et al., 2014). Immunoglobulin G (IgG) binds the alpha subunit of
Fe receptor (FceRIa) was firstly detected in CSU patients’ sera by Hide
et al. (1993). Circulating antibodies against either IgE or its receptor
can release basophil and mast cell mediators. The role of such antibodies in CSU was previously assessed by several studies (Fiebiger
et al., 1995; Kikuchi and Kaplan, 2001; Ulambayar et al., 2017).

The autologous serum skin test (ASST) is used to detect urticaria
patients. This test was first performed by Grattan et al., (1986). It is an

autoreactivity detection test in which intradermal injection of autologous serum acts directly on the skin vessels or acts indirectly by the
release of skin mast cell mediators. Autoreactivity does not denote
autoimmune mechanism, but it may be an indicator of mast cell activating autoantibodies (Sajedi et al., 2011). ASST specificity was
doubtful as false-positive results appeared due to bradykinin and protease cleaved C5, which released during blood clotting to separate the
serum. So, autologous plasma skin test (APST) was used instead of ASST
in order to increase the specificity (Asero et al., 2006). Heparin inhibits
the cells degranulation process (Asero et al., 2001), so sodium citrate is
used for plasma separation (Asero et al., 2006).

This study is designed to evaluate the clinical utility of ASST and
APST as reflections of the autoreactivity in CSU patients. In addition,
the study assesses assessed the presence of circulating FceRla in CSU
patients and their correlation with other clinical and immunological
variables.

2. Material and methods

This study is a case-control study, carried out in the Allergy Unit of
the Microbiology and Immunology Department and clinical pathology
department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University.

From July 2017 to November 2017, the study included 40 healthy
controls and 40 CSU patients who had urticaria symptoms for at least 8
weeks. CSU disease activity was assessed using the urticaria activity
score (UAS) UAS7, which scores wheals number and pruritus intensity
within the last 7 days with a score ranging from 0 to 15.

Atopy was considered positive when at least one or more allergens
on the intradermal hypersensitivity skin test were positive with the
common inhalant allergens. Refractoriness to antihistamines was defined by persistence of symptoms even with an elevation of antihistamine doses for 4-fold.

Before the autologous serum skin test (ASST), antihistamines
withdrawal for minimally 5 days was done. ASST was performed by
intradermal injection of 50uL of each (autologous serum, histamine
diphosphate, and sterile physiological saline) into the volar forearm.
ASST positivity was considered when the wheal induced after 30 min of
intradermal serum injection was at least 1.5mm larger than that was
induced by saline injection (Konstantinou et al., 2009). For the APST,
citrated blood was centrifuged at room temperature to separate the
plasma. Immediately after separation, 50uL of each (autologous
plasma, histamine diphosphate, and sterile physiological saline) was
injected intradermally on the volar forearm (Sajedi et al., 2011). The
ASST and the APST positivity was considered when the wheal induced
after 30 min of intradermal serum/plasma injection was 1.5 mm larger
than that was induced by saline injection.

From all subjects, blood samples were collected and serum was separated within 30-60 min of collection, then stored at —80°C. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) was detected using HEp-2 cells and the immunofluorescence method (Diasorin, USA). Antithyroid autoantibodies
(ATA) were detected by using the Thyroglobulin IgG ELISA [Catalog
Number: TGO70 T] and Thyroid Peroxidase IgG ELISA [Catalog
Number: TP069 G] (Calbiotech, Spring Valley, CA). Enzyme
Immunoassay for the Quantitative Determination of Immunoglobulin E
(IgE) Concentration in Human Serum was used [REF.: E29-006]
(Immunospec, Canoga Park, CA).

Detection of anti-FceRIa autoantibody was conducted by in-house
ELISA. Recombinant Human Fce Rla [Catalog Number: 6678-FC] (BioTechne, USA) was reconstituted at 5 g/mL concentration in a phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The microtitre plate was coated with the
antigen and incubated overnight at 4°C. After that, the plate was washed 3 times with PBS, and then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 2h at room temperature. After washing, the serum samples
were added at a 1:100 dilution with PBS to each well, then incubated
for 2h at room temperature. After washing, peroxidase-conjugated
rabbit anti-human IgG [Catalog Number: BA1070-0.5] (Boster, CA,
USA) was diluted (to reach 0.1 g/mL with 0.01 M PBS) and added to
each well, then incubated for 1h at room temperature. The reaction
was visualized using 3,3,5,5, tetramethylbenzidine [Catalog Number:
3652-F10] (Mabtech, Sweden) as a substrate for 10 min. The reaction
was stopped by 1 mol/L H2S04. Optical density (OD) was read at
405 nm; and 630 nm was used as a reference filter by BioTek ELx800
Absorbance Microplate Readers (Bio-Tek Instruments, USA). The OD
cutoff point was set as the mean of OD for negative controls plus 3
standard deviations. The positivity was considered when the OD exceeded the cutoff value.

3. Statistical analysis

The comparisons between quantitative variables were done using a
Student-T test or Manne-Whitney U test. For categorical data, chisquared (x2) test was performed. The adjusted odds ratios (OR) and
their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were determined by Multiple

Logistic Regression Analysis. Statistical analysis was carried out using
SPSS, version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). p-value < 0.05 was
considered significantly different.

4. Results

Demographic and clinical characteristics of CSU patients and controls are shown in Table 1. There were no significant differences between patients and controls for age and gender (p > 0.05).

Differences in laboratory findings between the CSU patients and
control subjects are shown in Table 2. The prevalence of ANA in CSU
patients and controls was 7.5% and 2.5%, respectively (p = 0.31). The
prevalence of ATA in CSU patients was 20% and statistically significant
when compared with that of controls (p = 0.003).

The prevalence of IgG to FceRIa was 52.5% in CSU patients, whereas
only 2.5% of the controls had positive results (P < 0.0001). According
to ASST results, the prevalence of IgG to FceRIa in CSU patients was
27.3% and 83.3% for ASST (negative and positive respectively)
(p = 0.0004) (Fig. 1). As for APST results, the prevalence of IgG to
FceRla in CSU patients was 17.6% and 78.3% for APST (negative and
positive respectively) (p = 0.0002) (Fig. 2).

Association of IgG to FceRIa with other clinical parameters in CSU
patients is illustrated in Table 3. Percentage of females was higher in
patients with positive IgG to FceRla (81%) in comparison with IgG to
FceRIa-negative patients (47.4%) (p = 0.03). The percentage of positive ASST was higher in patients with positive IgG to FceRla when
compared to IgG to FceRla-negative patients (71.4% and 15.8%, respectively) (p < 0.0001). The percentage of positive APST was higher
in patients with positive IgG to FceRla in comparison with IgG to
FceRla-negative patients (85.7% and 26.3% respectively)
(p < 0.0001).

There were no significant differences in the age, urticaria duration,
UAS, the presence of atopy and of angioedema (between IgG positive
and negative groups). The presence of refractoriness to antihistamines

(28.6% vs. 15.8%) showed a higher trend in patients with IgG to FceRla
compared to those without IgG to FceRIa although no statistical significance difference was found (p = 0.33). There were no statistically
significant differences in ANA and total IgE between IgG to FceRIa
positive and negative patients. The percentage of positive ATA was
higher in patients with positive IgG to FceRIla compared to IgG to

FceRla-negative patients (33.3% and. 5.3% respectively) (p = 0.03)
(Table 3).

Multiple Logistic Regression Analysis of IgG to FceRla of CSU patients revealed a significantly higher risk of positive ASST (adjusted
OR = 14.7, 95% CI = 1.8-111.1, p = 0.01) and of positive APST (adjusted OR = 10.3, 95% CI = 1.15-90.9, p = 0.03). Regarding the type
of gender, females were statistically insignificant in patients with IgG to
FceRla (adjusted OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 0.3-20.4, p = 0.39). Positive
ATA was statistically borderline in anti FceRla positive patients (adjusted OR = 11.6, 95% CI = 0.9-142.8, p = 0.05).

5. Discussion

The prevalence of ANA in CSU patients and controls was 7.5% and
2.5% respectively. The prevalence of ATA in CSU patients was 20% and
significantly higher when compared with that of controls. Ulambayar
et al. (2017) reported that the prevalence of ANA and ATA in CSU
patients was 20.8% and 24.8% respectively. Also, Altrichter et al.
(2011) stated that CSU patients have been repeatedly reported to show
a high incidence of autoimmune thyroiditis. Up to 33% of patients reportedly expressed an increase of ATA in comparison with only 5% of
healthy individuals. Ye et al. (2012) found that 33.3% of Korean
chronic urticaria patients exhibited a positive result for ATA and ANA.
The frequency of antibodies to thyroglobulin, thyroperoxidase or both
is estimated at 12-29% in urticaria patients. The results are really similar regarding ATA and the percentage positives for normals is correct
at 3-6%. (Verneuil et al., 2004; Najib et al., 2009; Abd El-Azim and Abd
El-Azim, 2011; Mohamed et al., 2016). The present results revealed a
borderline risk of ATA and anti FceRI. Such an association of ATA and
anti FceRI has been proved by Kikuch et al. (2003).

This study found that the frequency of ASST positivity in CSU patients is 45%. This goes in agreement with Abd El-Azim and Abd ElAzim (2011), who stated that 39.6% of their chronic autoimmune urticaria had a positive ASST result, and the prevalence of positive ASST
results in CU patients was reported to vary from 34% to 70% in various
studies (Nettis et al., 2002; Bakos and Hillander, 2003; Caproni et al.,
2004; George and Balachandran, 2008; Vikramkumar et al., 2014;
Beevi et al., 2017). ASST may generate false-positive results due to the
high amount of bradykinin generated during the serum preparation
(Ward et al., 1970; Fusari et al., 2005; Asero et al., 2011).

The present study detected a nonsignificant female predominance
among CSU cases (65%). Although Caproni et al. (2004) and Abd ElAzim and Abd El-Azim (2011) stated that their studies found a female
predominance in CAU patients. The total IgE level is significantly
higher in CSU patients when compared to control subjects with a
threefold increase in CSU. This result agrees with those of Altrichter
et al. (2011) who found that nearly 50% of CSU patients exhibit a
significantly fourfold increase in the level of total serum IgE.

The prevalence of IgG to FceRla was 52.5% of CSU patients whereas
only 2.5% of the controls had positive results of IgG to FceRIa. Fiebiger
et al. (1995) demonstrated that 37% of CSU patients had IgG autoantibody against FceRla in their sera. Ferrer et al. (1998) reported that
Anti-FceRIa antibody was found in 64% of CU patients. This IgG to
FceRlIa can be detected in 24%-60% of CSU patients (Sabroe et al.,
1999, 2002; Grattan, 2004). Kaplan and Joseph (2007) introduced
findings that agree with those of the present study and include large
numbers of patients. Ulambayar et al. (2017) reported, in their study,
that Anti-FceRla antibody was found in 24.8% of CSU patients, and it
was detected in 3.1% of NCs. On another hand, the percentage was
somehow high in the study of Eckman et al. (2008) since it reached
57% positive anti FceRIa in normal control subjects. Also, Vasager
et al., (2006) and Cho et al., (2013) cast doubt on anti FceRIa specificity
in the CSU.

The prevalence of IgG to FceRIa, according to ASST results, in CSU
patients was 13.6% and 83.3% for ASST negative and positive patients,
respectively. Also, Ulambayar et al. (2017) reported that positivity rates
S.A. Baioumy et al.

for IgG autoantibody to FceRla were significantly higher in ASST positive CSU patients than in ASST negative CSU patients (32.8% versus
16.4).

Regarding association of IgG to FceRlIa with other clinical parameters in CSU patients, the female percentage was higher in patients
with positive IgG to FceRIa (81%) when compared to IgG to FceRIa
negative patients (47.4%). Ulambayar et al. (2017) reported that sex
was found to be an important factor associated with positivity for IgG to
FceRIa. This was noted in (6.1%) of male versus (31.5%) of CSU female
patients.

The percentage of positive ASST was higher in patients with positive
IgG to FceRIa when compared to IgG to FceRIa negative patients (71.4%
and 15.8%, respectively). This IgG to FceRIa proved to be relevant in
CSU patients with positive ASST (Staubach et al., 2006; Altrichter et al.,
2011). Lee et al. (2014) found that the presence of IgG anti-FceRIa was
detected in 70% of CU patients with positive ASST. Using the immunodot technique, Ulambayar et al. (2017) reported that positivity
rates for IgG autoantibody to FceRIa were significantly higher in ASST
positive CSU patients than in ASST negative CSU patients (32.8% vs.
16.4%).

Immunoblotting is a poor way to detect such antibodies, and as
noted, has a highly false positive rate in normal controls. ELISA gives
also false positives, but this may depend on the antibody used (Ferrer
et al., 1998). Discrepancies were due to non-functional IgG2 antibodies
(Soundararajan et al., 2005) or cross-reactions of alpha chain with IgG
autoantibodies directed against other autoantibodies or carbohydrates
which interfere with the results of binding assays (Pachlopnik et al.,
2004).

The percentage of a positive APST was higher in patients with positive IgG to FceRIa in comparison with IgG to FceRIa-negative patients
(85.7% and 26.3%, respectively). So, APST can be considered a reflection of the autoimmunity in CSU patients. In contrast, Asero et al.
(2006) reported that most patients with chronic urticaria are positive
on APST mainly due to the generation of thrombin and partially due to
the presence of circulating antibodies. In the skin tests, the use of
normal serum or plasma instead of saline as a negative control may help
in excluding the autoreactivity.

The present study found that no statistically significant difference
between IgG positive and IgG negative patients as regards age, duration
of illness, atopy status, angioedema, and UAS. ANA positivity and total
serum IgE level show no significant difference between IgG positive and
IgG negative patients. This goes in line with Ulambayar et al. (2017)
who reported that there were no significant differences in mean values
of age, serum total IgE levels, urticaria duration and UAS (between IgG
to FceRla positive and FceRla negative groups).

The present study found that there is no statistically significant
difference between positive IgG patients and IgG negative patients as
regards refractoriness to antihistamines. This goes in agreement with
Ulambayar et al. (2017) who reported that the proportion of antihistamines refractory patients between IgG to FceRIa positive and negative patients was not different.

The higher prevalence of IgG to FceRIa in patients with positive
ASST needs further prospective studies of a larger sample to evaluate
IgG to FceRIa as a potential biomarker in CSU and to predict therapeutic outcomes of the new immunological treatment protocols.

6. Conclusions

Circulating IgG to FceRla was detected in 52.5% of CSU patients,
including 83.3% of ASST-positive patients and 78.3% of APST-positive
patients. Circulating IgG to FceRIa involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of CSU.
