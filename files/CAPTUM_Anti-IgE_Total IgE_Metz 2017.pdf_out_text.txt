Abstract

 

Background. Treatment with omalizumab, a humanized recombinant monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, results
in clinical efficacy in patients with Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU). The mechanism of action of
omalizumab in CSU has not been elucidated in detail.

Objectives. To determine the effects of omalizumab on levels of high affinity IgE receptor-positive (FceRI*)
and IgE-positive (IgE+) dermal cells and blood basophils. Treatment efficacy and safety were also assessed.

Study design. In a double-blind study, CSU patients aged 18-75 years were randomized to receive 300 mg
omalizumab (n=20) or placebo (n=10) subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 12 weeks. Changes in disease
activity were assessed by use of the weekly Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7). Circulating IgE levels, basophil
numbers and levels of expression of FceRI* and IgE* cells in the skin and in blood basophils were determined.

Results. Patients receiving omalizumab showed a significantly greater decrease in UAS7 compared with
patients receiving placebo. At Week 12 the mean difference in UAS7 between treatment groups was -14.82
(p=0.0027), consistent with previous studies.

Total IgE levels in serum were increased after omalizumab treatment and remained elevated up to Week 12.
Free IgE levels decreased after omalizumab treatment.

Mean levels of FceRI* skin cells in patients treated with omalizumab 300 mg were decreased at Week 12
compared with baseline in the dermis of both non-lesional and lesional skin, reaching levels comparable with
those seen in healthy volunteers (HVs). There were no statistically significant changes in mean FceRI* cell
levels in the placebo group. Similar results were seen for changes in IgE* cells, although the changes were not
statistically significant.

The level of peripheral blood basophils increased immediately after treatment start and returned to Baseline
values after the follow-up period. The levels of FceRI and IgE expression on peripheral blood basophils were
rapidly reduced by omalizumab treatment up to Week 12.

Conclusions. Treatment with omalizumab resulted in rapid clinical benefits in patients with CSU. Treatment
with omalizumab was associated with reduction in Fc€ RI+ and IgE* basophils and intradermal cells.

Introduction

Omalizumab  (Xolair®) is a recombinant
humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to IgE at
its binding site to the high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI)
[1]. Free IgE levels fall between 89 to 98% over 16 to 24
weeks of therapy. Associated with the decrease in free
IgE levels is a down-regulation in the expression of
FceRI receptors on basophils and mast cells [2-4]. In
addition, recent data show that omalizumab is able to
dissociate pre-bound IgE from mast cells and
basophils [5, 6].

Omalizumab is effective in the treatment of
chronic spontaneous / idiopathic urticaria (CSU /
CIU) [7-13] including in patients who have relapsed
after stopping treatment with omalizumab [14].
Omalizumab is approved for the treatment of CSU (in
the EU) and CIU (in the USA) patients who remain
symptomatic despite H1-antihistamine treatment [15,
16].

Urticaria is characterized by the development of
hives, angioedema, or both [17]. Pathogenesis of CSU
is not fully understood [17]. It appears to be a mast
cell- and basophil-mediated hypersensitivity reaction
[18-22]. Histamine and other mediators are released
on activation of basophils and mast cells, and these
mediators ultimately give rise to the clinical signs and
symptoms of CSU. The pathology of CSU lesions
resembles that of allergen-mediated late-phase skin
reactions, suggesting involvement of FceRI activation
of mast cells and basophils [23]. Antigen cross-linking
of IgE bound to FceRI is a known mediator of basophil
and mast cell activation [24]. Also, approximately 45%
of CSU patients have _histamine-releasing
autoantibodies against either FceRI or IgE [25, 26]; the
clinical significance is unclear, but as cross-linking of
IgE or FceRI on mast cell or basophil surface may
result in activation and release of inflammatory
mediators [27-29], these antibodies may be involved
in disease pathogenesis [30, 31]. It has also been
suggested that basophils in CSU patients may have
distinct alterations in FceRIla mediated degranulation,
independent of any role of autoantibodies [32-34].

Little is known about the effects of omalizumab
on basophil numbers and function in CSU. A previous
skin biopsy study in patients with allergic rhinitis [4]
showed that omalizumab treatment was associated
with a decrease in the number of FceRI* mast cells in
the skin and basophils in the blood, and that this was
associated with a reduction in the size of
allergen-induced hives in intradermal skin tests.
Treatment with omalizumab reduced serum IgE and
IgE* cells in the airway mucosa of patients with
allergic asthma [35]. The effects of omalizumab on

1267

basophils from the circulation of CSU patients has
been described before [36] but little is known about
local effects of omalizumab treatment in the skin.
Therefore, the current study took biopsies from
lesional and non-lesional skin of CSU patients, to
evaluate the effects of treatment with omalizumab on
basophil numbers and levels of FceRI* and IgE* skin
cells in CSU patients compared with that of skin from
healthy volunteers.

Methods

This was an exploratory, double-blind, parallel
group, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II study
(NCT01599637, EudraCT no. 2011-004216-31; Figure
1). Patients were enrolled at 4 centers in Germany.
The study was conducted in accordance with
applicable local regulations (including European
Directive 2001/20/EC, US Code of Federal
Regulations Title 21, and Japanese Ministry of Health,
Labor, and Welfare), the International Conference on
Harmonization E6 Guideline for Good Clinical
Practice, and the ethical principles of the Declaration
of Helsinki. The study protocol and all amendments
were reviewed by the Independent Ethics Committee
(IEC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each
center and written informed consent was obtained
from study participants before enrollment.

Study design

For CSU patients, the study consisted of a 10-day
screening period, during which patient eligibility for
study entry was assessed, followed by a 3-day
washout period and a 14-day baseline period (Figure
1). During this period, urticaria activity was assessed.
In patients who had taken rescue medication due to
high disease activity (a short-acting, non-sedating
antihistamine), the following day was not counted in
order to exclude any carry-over effect. However, if the
urticaria activity score (UAS) for that day was 6, the
day was counted irrespective of medication use on the
previous day. For the calculation of the baseline UAS7
seven individual days were calculated counting
backwards, beginning with the last day before
randomization. The treatment period was 12 weeks;
on Day 1 of the treatment period, patients were
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to omalizumab 300 mg or
placebo (3 subcutaneous doses at 4-weekly intervals,
ie. at Day 1, Week 4 and Week 8). After stopping the
treatment, patients were followed for an additional 8
weeks (follow-up). The total duration of the study per
patient was approximately 23 weeks. Skin biopsies
were taken from CSU patients at baseline, Week 1,

http://www.thno.org
Theranostics 2017, Vol. 7, Issue 5

Week 4 (optional), Week 12, and Week 20 (after
follow-up) from non-lesional and lesional skin (as
available). The optional biopsy at Week 4 was taken
from patients who showed response to treatment at
that time-point (defined as UAS7 <6), while no
response (UAS7 216) was seen at Week 1. On dosing
days (Day 1 and Day 29), biopsies were taken
pre-dose and blood samples were taken for
measurement of basophils. The eligibility of the
healthy volunteers (HVs) was assessed at a screening
visit, then at Day 1 a single skin biopsy was collected
and study completion assessments performed.

Study population

The study included patients, aged 18 to 75 years,
diagnosed with CSU who remained symptomatic
despite H1-antihistamine treatment at approved
doses, defined as presence of itch and hives for over 6
weeks prior to baseline, with UAS7 score of at least 16
and itch component of UAS7 of at least 8 during the 14
days prior to randomization. Patients had to have had
a CSU diagnosis for at least 6 months, and be on an
approved dose of an H1-antihistamine for CSU prior
to entering the study.

Exclusion criteria included weight >130 kg or
<40 kg at screening; heavy smoking; chronic urticaria
other than CSU; diseases with symptoms of urticaria
or angioedema (e.g. urticarial vasculitis, urticaria
pigmentosa, erythema multiforme, mastocytosis,
hereditary or acquired angioedema, lymphoma,
leukemia, or generalized cancer); history or presence
of atopic dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, dermatitis
herpetiformis, senile pruritus or other skin disease
associated with itch; evidence of parasitic infection;
any clinically relevant major systemic disease that

could potentially complicate interpretation of study
results; and inability to comply with study and
follow-up procedures. All subjects (both CSU patients
and controls) with asthma and atopic dermatitis were
excluded. History of clinically significant
hypersensitivity to omalizumab or similar drugs, or to
local anesthetics, and history of anaphylactic shock
were also exclusion criteria.

Patients were not allowed to be using other
investigational drugs at the time of randomization
(Day 1), or within 30 days or 5 half-lives of
enrollment, whichever was longer; could not have
had previous treatment with omalizumab; could not
be receiving routine doses of systemic or topical
corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate,
cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide or any other
immunomodulating drug (e.g. interferons) that could
alter the response to omalizumab treatment, or IV
immunoglobulin G, or plasmapheresis within 30 days
prior to -2 weeks. Regular oral doxepin use within 6
weeks prior to -2 weeks, use of any H2 antihistamine
or any leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs)
within 7 days prior to -2 weeks, or use of any H1
antihistamines at greater than approved doses within
3 days prior to -2 weeks were also not permitted.
Patients needed to be on stable doses for 4 weeks prior
to randomization (Day 1). Loratadine (a short-acting,
non-sedating antihistamine), was allowed to be used
as a rescue medication on an as needed basis up to 4
times the recommended dose of 10 mg, for
angioedema or other reasons specified by the patient.
The use of loratadine was documented by the patient
ina diary.

Age and gender-matched healthy volunteers
participated in the study to the CSU patients, and
were in good health. Exclusion criteria for healthy
volunteers were similar to those for CSU patients
(except for those criteria specifically related to
urticaria and its treatment), with the addition of the
use of any prescription drug or over-the-counter
medication within 2 weeks prior to Day 1
(paracetamol was acceptable, but its use had to be
documented).

Study endpoints

The primary variable was the relative change
from baseline to Week 12 in the FceRI* and/or IgE*
skin cells, based on skin biopsies collected from CSU
patients. Skin biopsy data from healthy volunteers
were used as a reference for data from CSU patients.

Assessments

Clinical efficacy and quality of life were assessed
using UAS7, patient's and investigator's global
assessment of symptoms using a graded Likert scale
scoring of symptoms (urticaria lesions [hives] and
itch), angioedema, Dermatology Life Quality Index
(DLQI), Skindex-29, and Chronic Urticaria Quality of
Life Questionnaire (CU-Q:OL) [37].

Patient symptoms of itch and hives were
recorded via electronic diary (eDiary) each morning
and evening on a daily basis to assess UAS. The
composite eDiary-recorded score with numeric
severity intensity ratings on a scale of 0-3 (0 = none to
3 = intense/severe) for the number of hives and the
intensity of itch. Daily UAS was calculated as the
average of the morning and evening scores; UAS7 is
the sum of the daily UAS scores over 7 days. Response
to treatment was defined as a 90% reduction from
baseline in UAS7, a cut-off previously used to
illustrate complete response in a retreatment study
[14].

Safety was assessed in terms of the frequency
and severity of adverse events (AEs), vital signs, ECG
evaluations, and clinical laboratory measurements.
Serum omalizumab concentrations were evaluated
using a validated ELISA method with an anticipated
Lower Limit of Quantification (LLOQ) of 28 ng/mL.

Measurement of basophils

Blood samples were taken and incubated with
antibodies (Lineage cocktail-FITC [Becton Dickinson],
CD203c/PerCPCy5.5 [Biolegend], IgE-PE [Biolegend]
and FceR1-APC [eBioscience]) at RT, fixed with 1%
paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
and the samples stored frozen at -80°C before
shipment on dry ice to a central processing laboratory.
Thawed samples were processed as follows: after
centrifugation for 7 min at 500g at RT, the pellets were

1269

washed and aspirated twice, before being
resuspended in 2001 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS.
They were then analyzed within 4 hours by
fluorescent antibody cell sorting (FACS) performed
on a FACS-Canto II (Becton Dickinson, CA, USA)
using the FACSDiva software after adjustment with
antibodies bound to compensation particles. Mean
values and the coefficient of variation (CV) were
calculated and a CV <30% was acceptable.

Analysis of IgE

Blood samples were collected into additive free
tubes and allowed to clot over a minimum of 30 min
at room temperature (RT). Serum was collected after
centrifugation at approximately 3500 rpm for 10 min.
Serum samples were split into 2 aliquots and stored at
-20°C until analysis at the central laboratory. Serum
levels of free IgE and total IgE (i.e. the sum of free and
bound IgE) were determined by _ specific
immunoassays, as described previously [38].

Biopsies

Patients provided biopsies from non-lesional
and lesional skin (as available). An optional biopsy
could be performed at Week 4; this was targeted at
slower responding patients and therefore the
numbers of biopsies collected at this time-point
depended on response to treatment. Skin biopsies
with a minimum diameter of 6 mm were taken at each
scheduled time-point. Baseline biopsies were taken
from one location with lesional skin and from one
with non-lesional skin. Following treatment, biopsies
were taken at locations close to the locations chosen at
baseline. Biopsy samples were stored at -80°C until
sectioned.

Histopathology procedures

Biopsy samples were examined using
immunohistochemistry techniques. Samples from
skin biopsies were sectioned (5 um) with a cryostat at
approximately -21°C and placed on glass slides. After
fixing with acetone (-20°C for 10 min), sections were
dried and kept at -20°C. Staining (IHC, Giemsa, or
H&E) was carried out on thawed samples.

Immunohistochemical staining with alkaline
phosphatase (AP) was performed to analyze FceRI
and IgE. Samples were thawed and_ blocked
sequentially with biotin and avidin for 15 mins at RT,
followed by 2% fetal calf serum (FCS) in Tris-buffered
saline (TBS) for 20 mins at RT. Samples were then
incubated with specific primary antibodies, diluted in
TBS + 1% FCS for 1 hour at RT: mouse anti-CD117 (BD
555713), diluted 1:400; mouse anti-CD11c (BD 550375)
diluted 1:400; mouse anti-CD8 (DakoM7103) diluted
1:150; mouse anti CD4 (Dako M7310) diluted 1:200;
mouse anti-CD3 (Dako (M7254) diluted 1:400; mouse

http://www.thno.org
Theranostics 2017, Vol. 7, Issue 5

anti FCeR1 (eBioscience 14-5899) diluted 1:400; mouse
anti-tryptase (Dako M7052) diluted 1:500; or rabbit
anti-lgE (Dako A0094) diluted 1:5000. Negative
control staining was carried out using the same
concentration of IgGl (Dako X0931), IgG2bk
(eBioscience 14-4732) or rabbit IgG (Dako X0936).

Samples were then incubated with a biotinylated
secondary antibody (Link Antibody ready to use,
Dako REAL Detection System K50050) for 15 mins at
RT, then with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase
(Dako REAL Detection System K5005) for 15 mins at
RT, then with levamisole for 15 mins at RT before
being counterstained with hematoxylin for 5 seconds
at RT and mounted in aqueous solution.

Hematoxylin and eosin staining was carried out
on cryosections using Papanicolaous Solution la
Harris’ hematoxylin solution (Merck # 1.09253.2500)
and Eosin-Phloxin Solution (Hollborn, 1 L, # 601017).
Samples were mounted in Clarion environmentally
safe permanent mounting media.

Alkaline Giemsa-Staining was carried out on
cryosections using Giemsa Azur Eosin-Methylenblau
1:10 with 2% sodium borate solution before mounting
with Clarion environmentally safe permanent
mounting media.

Skin biopsy samples were scored on an average
number of positive cells from 5 visual fields.

Data analyses

Analyses of cellular data were based on the
pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis population, which
included all subjects who received at least one dose of
study drug and had evaluable PD data. The primary
variable was the relative change from baseline in
FceRI* and/or IgE* skin cells, based on skin biopsies
collected from patients with CSU after 12 weeks of
treatment relative to placebo. A _ two-tailed
two-sample t-test was used to compare groups that
employed a 5% significance level.

Correlation between UAS7 and the FcsRI- and
IgE-positive skin cells for baseline values and for the
change from baseline to Day 85 was assessed using
Spearman’s and Pearson's correlation analysis. All
results are given as two-tailed p-values, and p<0.05
was considered statistically significant.

All efficacy analyses were performed on the
intent-to-treat (ITT) population which included all
randomized patients who received at least one dose of
study drug and had post-randomization efficacy data.
The treatment groups were based on the treatment
assigned at randomization. For efficacy endpoints,
descriptive statistics were provided by treatment
group and time-point. UAS7 was also modeled using
a repeated measures ANCOVA model with baseline
UAS7 score as a covariate, and treatment, time, and

1270

treatment by time interaction as fixed factors.
All subjects who received at least one dose of
study drug were included in the safety analysis.

Results
Disposition of participants

Thirty patients were randomized to treatment,
20 in the omalizumab group and 10 in the placebo
group (Figure 2). One patient receiving omalizumab
discontinued prematurely (due to an AE), as did two
patients in the placebo group (due to administrative
problems). Data were analyzed from 17
omalizumab-treated patients and 9 patients in the
placebo group. All 10 healthy volunteers who entered
the study completed their single study visit.

Participant demographics and baseline
characteristics

The omalizumab and placebo groups of CSU
patients were generally well matched for
demographic characteristics. All patients were
Caucasian and 87% were female. The mean age was
38.7 years, with a range of 23 to 63 years. The mean
BMI was 27.7 kg/m?. There were four subjects with
reported allergies in the omalizumab-treated group
and one subject in the placebo-treated group.

Of the 10 healthy control subjects, all were
Caucasian and female, with a mean age of 36.4 years
(range 24 to 51 years) and mean BMI of 24.2 kg/m2.

UAS7 scores at baseline were comparable
between the groups. Mean (SD) baseline serum total
IgE concentrations were 1037 (2474) ng/mL in the
omalizumab 300 mg group and 442 (581) ng/mL in
the placebo group (Table 1).

Omalizumab reduces CSU activity

Decreases in UAS7 after omalizumab treatment
initiation were rapid (with separation of the curves at
Day 3) and sustained (Figure 3). At Week 12, the LS
mean difference in UAS7 between treatment groups
was -14.82 (p=0.0027).

More than 50% of patients in the omalizumab
group were UAS7 responders at Week 12 (Figure 4).
About half of these had become responders by the end
of Week 2. In contrast, <15% of patients receiving
placebo had improved by Week 12, without any
change occurring by Week 2.

The DLQI overall score, Skindex-29 score and
CU-Q,OL overall score all showed larger decreases
from baseline in the omalizumab group than the
placebo group. Mean (SD) scores at Week 12 are
shown in Table 2. In addition, physicians’ and
patients’ global assessment scores, itch, hives scores as
well as loratadine use showed statistically significant

1271

differences between omalizumab and placebo-treated
patients at Week 12 (Table 2).

increased after the first treatment and remained
elevated up to Week 12. The increase largely occurred
by Day 8. No change was observed in placebo-treated
subjects and in these subjects total IgE equals free IgE
(Figure 5A).

In omalizumab-treated subjects, the free IgE
levels decreased after the first treatment and
remained suppressed until Week12 (Figure 5B).
Virtually all of the decrease occurred during the first
48 hours following treatment.

Omalizumab increases peripheral blood
basophils and reduces basophil FceRI and IgE
expression

Mean levels of basophils are low in untreated
CSU patients. In patients treated with omalizumab
there was a non-statistically significant increase in
peripheral blood basophils over the treatment period
compared with placebo, mostly occurring by Week 2,
but basophil levels returned to patients’ baseline
values after the follow-up period (Figure 6A).

Omalizumab treatment reduced FceRI and IgE
expression on peripheral blood basophils early in the
treatment period (by Week 1) and the reduction was
sustained through to Week 12 (Figure 6B and C).
These values started to return towards baseline, but
did not reach baseline values during the follow-up
period.

Omalizumab treatment normalized levels of
FceRI* and IgE* skin cells

Mean levels of FceRI and IgE expressing cells
were higher in untreated CSU patients compared with
HVs. Omalizumab, but not placebo, reduced these
levels to those seen in HVs. In patients treated with
omalizumab, mean levels of FceRI* cells were
statistically significantly decreased at Week 12
compared with baseline (Day 1) in non-lesional skin
(14.7 vs. 14.2 in HVs per visual field). Similar changes
were observed for lesional skin (data not shown). No
statistically significant changes in mean FceRI* cell
levels occurred in the placebo group (Figure 7).

Similarly, mean levels of IgE* cells in the dermis
of the omalizumab-treated patients were reduced to
levels comparable with those of HVs at baseline.
Decreases from baseline to Week 12 in mean levels of
IgE* cells were observed in patients treated with
omalizumab in dermis of non-lesional skin (9.80 vs.
8.76 in HV per visual field), (Figure 7). Little
difference was observed for lesional skin (data not
shown).

There was a good correlation of baseline UAS7
scores and FceRI-positive skin cells at baseline in
lesional and non-lesional skin and the changes from
baseline for these two parameters correlated for the
non-lesional skin. No correlations were observed
between UAS7 and IgE-positive skin cells at baseline
but changes in UAS7 correlated with changes in
IgE-positive skin cells after treatment in non-lesional
skin as shown by Spearman correlation coefficient
(Table 3).

Omalizumab is well tolerated

Omalizumab was generally well-tolerated in this
study. The overall incidence of AEs was slightly
higher in the omalizumab group than in the placebo
group (85% vs. 70%) and one person in the
omalizumab group discontinued due to urticaria,
which was considered mild and not considered to be
related to study drug. The most frequently reported
AEs overall was nasopharyngitis, which occurred at a
similar rate in the omalizumab 300 mg and placebo
groups. Influenza and urticaria were the next most
frequent AEs overall and were reported at the same
frequency in each treatment group. The AE profile
was not unexpected in the patient population being
studied.

Discussion

Omalizumab has been shown to be effective in
the treatment of CSU, but its mechanism of action is
not fully understood. Omalizumab decreases
circulating levels of free IgE in the bloodstream, but
how this pharmacodynamic effect leads to the

1274

alleviation of the clinical signs and symptoms is not
completely clear. In this study, treatment of CSU
patients with omalizumab 300 mg for 12 weeks was
associated with reduced free IgE, consistent with the
effect seen in asthma patients.[39] A statistically
significant reduction in levels of FceRI* cells in the
dermis of non-lesional and lesional skin was observed
and these results were temporally associated with the
plateau of the improvement in clinical response.
Reduction in FceRI* cells was also observed in a
previous study of skin biopsies from patients with
allergic rhinitis [4], and would be expected as FceRI*
cell density is dependent on free IgE, which decreases
during omalizumab treatment. IgE* cells in the dermis
of non-lesional and lesional skin also decreased
following omalizumab treatment although this
decrease was not statistically significant. The decrease
in IgE* cells was also expected, as omalizumab binds
to free IgE and prevents it binding to FceRI.
Subsequently, FceRI are down-regulated [5]. Levels of
FceRI* and IgE* cells in omalizumab-treated patients
at Week 12 had reduced to levels of those seen in
healthy subjects at baseline. Overall, these results
demonstrate that the systemic effects of omalizumab
lead to local changes in the skin and there seems to be
no difference in FceRI* and IgE levels between
affected (lesional) and unaffected (non-lesional) skin.

While the mode of action of omalizumab in CSU
patients is not fully understood, there are a few key
hypotheses. One is that the density of IgE receptors at
the surface of mast cells and basophils is proportional
to the plasma-free IgE level [40]. Omalizumab binds
to the same region on IgE as FceRI [41], reducing free
IgE to near undetectable levels. This should therefore
down-regulate the FceRI receptors so that e.g.
potentially relevant IgG autoantibodies cannot
cross-link FceRI [42]. Cell activation would be
suppressed, as would all the subsequent
inflammatory processes. As a consequence, the
frequency and severity of symptoms of CSU should
be markedly diminished. This would account for a
therapeutic effect of omalizumab in the
approximately 30% of CSU patients with such
autoantibodies. However, in patients without
detectable autoantibodies, IgE and FceRI seem to play
an important role as well, as demonstrated by the
efficacy of omalizumab in this population [43].

It has also been suggested that down-regulation
of FceRI may be accompanied by an increase in the
threshold above which degranulation of mast cells is
triggered [44, 45]. This may be an independent
mechanism of action, unrelated to prevention of
cross-linkage of surface receptors. For degranulation
to occur, a threshold number of receptors would need
to be activated. The fall in free IgE after omalizumab

 

http://www.thno.org
Theranostics 2017, Vol. 7, Issue 5

treatment (both in the circulation and in tissue) and
the reduction in the receptor density might therefore
increase the threshold for degranulation to a much
higher set point. Therefore, these two mechanisms
may complement each other.

The efficacy of omalizumab in this study was
similar to that observed in Phase III studies [9, 10].
Statistically significant and clinically meaningful
reductions in UAS7 scores were observed over 12
weeks of treatment, with a mean decrease relative to
placebo of -14.82 at Week 12. UAS7 decreased rapidly,
with changes evident by one week after the first dose.
Defining response to treatment as a 90% reduction in
UAS7 from baseline, more than half of patients
responded during the study, in line with that reported
in key clinical studies of omalizumab [46]. Other
clinical endpoints also showed improvements,
including the physicians’ and patients’ global
assessment scores, itch and hives assessment scores,
percentage of angioedema-free days and use of rescue
medication. Quality of life assessments (CU-Q2OL
overall score, DLQI overall score and Skindex-29
score) also showed improvements. The observed
correlations of FceRI-positive skin cells with UAS7
scores point to the relevance of these cells in CSU and
further supports the observation that reducing these
cells is linked to the mode of action and clinical
efficacy of omalizumab.

Omalizumab decreases serum free IgE levels,
and is associated with decreases in FceRI* cells and
IgE* cells in lesional and non-lesional skin (dermis) of
patients with CSU. These results support the
hypothesis that one mode of action of omalizumab in
CSU involves reduction of free IgE, resulting in a
down-regulation of surface IgE receptors, and
subsequent reduction in downstream signaling via
the FceRI pathway [42]. However, the clinical
response to omalizumab defined e.g. by UAS7 change
seems to occur much faster than the histological
changes in the skin. Therefore, further mechanisms
might be involved in the omalizumab mode of action.
Interestingly, the reduction of FceRI and IgE positive
peripheral basophils was much quicker and more
closely reflected by the clinical response. This might
be the result of an exchange of cells between different
compartments (e.g. skin and blood). Importantly,
changes in basophil parameters after omalizumab
treatment were quick in onset like the decrease of free
IgE but they were not indicative of clinical response as
there was no correlation between basophil parameters
and UAS7 (data not shown). Further investigations
are required to determine the role and observed
changes of peripheral basophils in CSU.

In conclusion, omalizumab was effective and
well-tolerated in the treatment of CSU patients in this

1275

study, consistent with the results of earlier Phase II
and III studies. While the results of this exploratory
study do require verification and extension in a larger
and appropriately powered investigation, the data
suggest that the decrease in free IgE, resulting from
omalizumab treatment, may lead to a reduction in
FceRI* cells and IgE* cells in the dermis (to levels seen
in healthy subjects). In addition, the changes observed
in omalizumab-treated patients in peripheral blood
basophils, in terms of basophil numbers, FceRI
expression and responsiveness of basophils to
activating stimulation by anti-lgE, may also be
involved in the therapeutic effect of omalizumab. This
is the first report demonstrating that the clinical effect
of omalizumab correlates with histopathological
markers.
