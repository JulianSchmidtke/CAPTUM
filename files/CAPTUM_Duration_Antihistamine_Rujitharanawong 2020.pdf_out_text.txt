Background. Cholinergic urticaria (CholU) is a subset of chronic inducible urticaria characterized by the recurrent pinpoint-sized
wheals that are induced by exercising or increasing core body temperature. Currently, the data of CholU in tropical climate is still
limited. Objective. To investigate the clinical features and natural course of CholU in a tropical country. Materials and Methods.
This retrospective chart review study analyzed the data of CholU patients aged over 18 years who visited Siriraj Urticaria Clinic,
Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between January 2007 and September 2019. Demographic data, clinical presentations, and
results of provocation tests and other laboratory investigations were evaluated and compared with other studies reported in
temperate zones. Results. Sixteen out of 2,175 chronic urticaria patients (0.7%) were diagnosed with CholU. The median age of
CholU patients was 28.0 + 11.7 years with male predominance (56.3%). Three patients (18.8%) had a history of atopy. Fifteen
patients (93.8%) were positive to the exercise provocation test. Nonsedating antihistamine drugs were a main treatment (73.8%).
Six patients (37.5%) were in remission at the time of the study, with a mean duration 4.3 years. The Kaplan-Meier survival
analysis demonstrated that 12.5%, 35.5%, and 67.9% of patients would have disease remission within 1 year, 5 years, and 13
years, respectively. Conclusions. The prevalence of CholU differs in each geographic region and is found to be low in tropical
countries with a median duration 4.3 years. The prevalence of atopy and anaphylaxis with CholU is also lower in tropical

countries than in temperate.

1. Introduction

Cholinergic urticaria (CholU) is a variant of inducible
urticaria induced by a rising core body temperature after
exercising, sweating, eating of spicy foods, stress, or passive
warming [1]. CholU mostly appears in pinpoint-sized and
urticaria eruptions with severe itch localized to the trunk
and limbs and usually disappears rapidly on its own within
a few hours. However, most patients with CholU feel discomfort in the skin that disturbs their quality of life [2-4]. In
severe patients, CholU may be related to exercise-induced
anaphylaxis, a severe wheal-flare reaction with systemic
involvement including difficult breathing, wheezing, or
abdominal pain [5]. The reported prevalence of CholU in a
general population varies from 0.023% to 11.2% in temperate
zone countries [6-8]. CholU mostly affects patients with age

 

 

 

onset in their second to third decade [9]. The pathogenesis of
CholU is still unclear. Some CholU patients are occasionally
associated with anhidrosis/hypohidrosis [10]. Acetylcholine
is noted to induce both sweating and wheals after intradermal injection [11]. The sweating-associated urticaria has
been proposed as the etiology of CholU. In addition, sweat
allergy that is a type I hypersensitivity against a component
of sweat is observed in patients with CholU [12].

The diagnosis of CholU is established by history and an
appropriate provocation test that is suitable to the patient’s
age and general condition. Previously, both heavy exercise
and the passive warming that can increase the core body temperature have been utilized to confirm the diagnosis of
CholU. CholU is diagnosed if wheal-flare reaction develops
instantly or within a few minutes after heavy exercise or
passive warming and commonly disappears within 15-60
minutes [13]. The intradermal injection of 100 ug of methacholine in 0.1 ml of saline solution was used as another test
for CholU diagnosis in both clinical and research settings.
Wheal-flare reaction that occurs within 1 minute of the injection indicates a positive reaction [14, 15]. However, the positive methacholine skin test demonstrates a hypersensitivity
to cholinergic mediators that is not specific to CholU [16].
Thus, it has become less popular. Nowadays, the European
Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology Dermatology Section, the Global Allergy and Asthma European
Network, the European Dermatology Forum, and the
Urticaria Network e.V. (EAACI/ GA?LEN/EDF/UNEV)
recommends 2 methods to investigate patients who are
suspected CholU: (i) exercise machines: patients exercise by
a bicycle trainer or treadmill for 30 minutes resulting in an
increased pulse rate by 3 beats/minute every minute, and
while a patient is testing, the doctor will monitor signs of
Chol; (ii) a passive warming test: a person stays in a 42
degrees Celsius (°C) bath, and a doctor monitors body temperature [1]. Patients continue the passive warming test for
15 minutes after body temperature increases >1°C over baseline. The positive result shows pinpoint-sized wheals during
the test and ten minutes after ending the test [1].

The current EAACI/GA*LEN/EDE/UNEV consensus
recommended the use of nonsedating histamine H, receptor
antagonist (nsAH,) drugs as the first-line treatment, together
with trigger avoidance as the best approach for CholU
[1]. In refractory cases, updosing of nsAH, and omalizumab
(a recombinant humanized IgG, monoclonal antibody that
binds to IgE) is recommended to improve the disease activity
[1]. The addition of a H, receptor antagonist (AH,), propranolol ($,-adrenergic blocker), montelukast, and botulinum toxin injection has been reported as an effective
treatment [1]. Furthermore, desensitization by routine exercise or treatment with autologous sweat in CholU patients
with sweat allergy has been reported. Nevertheless, desensitization procedure should be conducted under physician
observation due to risk of anaphylaxis [12, 17, 18]. Relating
to the disease courses, the reported mean disease duration in
patients who had disease remission was 4-7.5 years [1, 9, 19].

At present, there were only 2 studies of CholU in tropical
countries. Godse et al. demonstrated the prevalence of CholU
in Indian students by conducting a survey questionnaire [6].
Sanchez et al. reported physical and environmental factors
which played a key role in CholU by questioning Colombian
patients about triggers with exacerbation of CholU [19].
However, the mean duration of disease remission and remission rate had never been reported. Thus, the information of
CholU in tropical climate is still limited. This study is aimed
at investigating the clinical features and natural history of
CholU in Thailand which is a tropical country.

 

 

2. Materials and Methods

This retrospective chart review study was designed to analyze
preexisting data of CholU patients aged over 18 years who
visited Siriraj Urticaria Clinic, Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok,
Thailand, between January 2007 and September 2019. The
study received the permission from the Siriraj Institutional

BioMed Research International

Review Board. Demographic data, clinical presentations,
and results of provocation tests and other laboratory investigations were analyzed.

In this study, CholU was diagnosed by history of whealflare reaction and/or angioedema after exercise or increasing
of the core body temperature and confirmed by provocation
testing that matched the patient’s age and general condition.
The stationary bicycle was our routine provocation device. If
patients were limited of physical activity, a passive warming
test was performed by full bath at 42°C for up to 15 minutes
until body core temperature increased more than 1°C [1].
The positive result was the appearance of present tiny wheals
that often localized on the limbs and trunk within 10 minutes
[1]. All patients should discontinue any antihistamines at
least for 1 week before the confirmation tests.

A remission of CholU was defined as an absence of
wheal-flare reaction or angioedema regardless of increasing
the body temperature and discontinuation of any urticaria
treatment for at least 6 months. Of the remission cases, the
disease duration was determined from the onset of symptoms
to the remission date.

2.1. Statistical Analysis. In descriptive statistics, the demographic data, disease duration, and results of provocation
testing and laboratory investigations were illustrated by
mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, frequency,
and percentages. The probability of remission among
patients with CholU at each time point was determined by
a Kaplan-Meier survival curve. The analysis of statistical data
was assessed by the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
(SPSS) Statistics for Windows, version 18 (SPSS _Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA).

3. Results

Out of the 2,175 chronic urticaria patients who visited Siriraj
Urticaria Clinic between January 2007 and September 2019,
178 patients (8.2%) were diagnosed as inducible urticaria.
Sixteen patients (0.7%) with CholU diagnosis were enrolled
in this study. The mean age was 28.0+11.7 years (range
18-56 years). The majority were males (56.3%). Table 1
shows the clinical characteristics of our CholU patients. Concomitant CSU was detected in 4 patients (25.0%). One
patient (6.3%) has CholU coexisting with angioedema. No
patients had symptoms of anaphylaxis. Three patients had
positive atopic history (18.8%), mostly allergic rhinitis
(n=2, 12.5%). All patients were healthy with no known
underlying disease.

All patients were investigated by the exercise provocation
test. Fifteen patients (93.8%) showed positive wheal and flare
reaction. The only one patient with a negative exercise
provocation test result had a confirmed history of wheal
and angioedema after heavy exercise such as running and
dancing.

Most of our CholU patients (73.8%) were treated with
nonsedating second-generation H, antihistamine drugs
(nsAH,), ie., fexofenadine (12 patients, 75%), cetirizine
(7 patients, 43.8%), loratadine (6 patients, 37.5%), desloratadine (2 patients, 12.5%), bilastine (2 patients, 12.5%), and

in Table 1. As stated in the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, 5
patients (31.3%) were in remission during the first 2 years of
the disease. Figure 1 demonstrates that the remission within
1 year, 5 years, and 13 years was 12.5%, 35.5%, and 67.9%
of patients, respectively. After onset, the median duration
before half of the patients were in remission was 12.2 years.

4. Discussion

In this study, the prevalence of CholU among chronic urticaria patients in a tropical country is 0.7%. Our group previously reported the prevalence of CholU among chronic
urticaria patients of 0.9% and 0.5% in the years 2007 and
2011, respectively [20, 21]. The reported prevalence of CholU
among general population in countries located in the tropical
zones ranged from 0.023 to 11.2% [6-8]. Most studies including our study have shown the male predominance [6]. The
mean age at symptom onset in our study was 28.0+ 11.7
years that is consistent with the data reported in temperate
zones [9]. Ten patients (62.5%) had concomitantly other
types of urticaria, mostly CSU. One patient had a combination of CholU, CSU, and dermographism.

Table 2 presents the information of CholU obtained in 3
temperate countries and 2 tropical countries compared with
our study [2, 6-9, 19]. Although Thailand is located in the

tropical zone and the latitude here seems to induce CholU,
the prevalence of CholU is lower than in other temperate
countries. We proposed that patients in the tropical zone
are used to be in hot environment and the severity of CholU
may be mild. Some patients misunderstand that the whealflare reaction is caused by sweating or irritation due to dust
and do not see the doctor. Thus, the prevalence of CholU
may be underdiagnosed in the tropical zone. Duke proposed
that changes in temperature might be an associated factor in
temperature-related urticaria, i.e., cold urticaria, rather than
constant temperature [22]. Perhaps, the prevalence of CholU
is less frequent in tropical countries due to less change in hot
temperature. However, the supporting knowledge is still deficit to support that changes in temperature are likely to
induce temperature-related urticaria (cold urticaria, heat
urticaria, and CholU).

In this study, 3 patients (18.8%) had positive histories of

atopy, ie. allergic rhinitis (2 patients, 12.5%) and asthma
(1 patient, 6.3%). In 2012, Vichyanond et al. reported
the prevalence of allergic rhinitis and asthma in healthy
subjects (26.3% and 8.8%, respectively) [23]. Nowadays,
the prevalence of atopy trends to increase throughout the
world [24]. These data implied that the prevalence of
atopy was not raised in CholU patients in our study. Contrary to the studies of temperate countries, Zuberbier et al.
reported the high prevalence of atopy in German patients
with CholU (45.5%) to be statistically significant demonstrated when compared with control persons (30.8%)
(p <0.05) [7].
None of patients in our study had any systemic involvement or history of anaphylaxis. The result was consistent
with the study of Godse et al. that no Indian patient presented with exercise-induced anaphylaxis [6]. To compare
with temperate countries, 3 Korean patients (3.3%) with
chest tightness were reported by Kim et al. [9]. Respectively,
CholU-induced anaphylaxis might be lesser noticed in tropical countries than in temperate countries.

Before 2016, the guideline treatment of physical urticaria
was not established. Grattan et al. proposed that patients who
failed with single dosage nsAH, could try at least 2 nsAH,
together to control chronic urticaria [25]. Alsamarai et al.
proposed that the combination of AH, and AH, was an effective treatment of CholU with complete control symptoms
and a low relapsing rate [26]. Almost all patients in this study
(15 patients) were treated by the combination of AH, (mostly
nsAH,) and other medications including other nsAH,, sAH,,
AH,, and propranolol to control their disease symptom. At
present, the current EAACI/GA7LEN/EDF/UNEV consensus recommendations for CholU management suggest
nsAH, as the first choice of treatment and trigger factor
avoidance [1]. If standard dosing is insufficient to control
symptoms, updosing of nsAH1 up to 4-fold is recommended.
In recalcitrant patients, omalizumab is recommended as the
second-line treatment to add with AH, [1, 27]. Currently,
novel biologics are being investigated as therapeutic options
for CholU [28]. Ligelizumab, a humanized IgG, monoclonal
antibody, attaches to the Ce3 domain of IgE to inhibit
interaction with the FCeRI on the surface of mast cells and
basophils that is similar to omalizumab [29]. Quilizumab,

 

 

 

 

 

a humanized IgG, that binds the M1 prime segment of
membrane-expressed IgE, has been demonstrated to
decrease IgE levels in human subjects [30]. At present, both
of them have been investigated in randomized controlled
studies evaluating patients with refractory chronic inducible
urticaria including CholU.

The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that
the remission rate within 1 year, 5 years, and 13 years was
12.5%, 35.5%, and 67.9% of our CholU patients, respectively.
After onset, the median duration before half of the patients
were in remission was 12.2 years. Limitations of our study
were a limited number of patients with CholU and a
retrospective study in which some data was missing. Further
studies are needed to investigate rates of remission of CholU
in other populations.

5. Conclusion

The prevalence of CholU is different in each geographic
region, and the prevalence of CholU was found to be low in
a tropical country with the median duration of CholU 4.3
years. The prevalence of atopy and anaphylaxis in patients
with CholU in tropical countries is lower than that in temperate countries; however, other factors are indistinguishable
between the tropical and temperate zones.
