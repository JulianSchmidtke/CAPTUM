Background: Omalizumab is not considered a disease-modifying drug and, accordingly, a large proportion
of patients experience a relapse following withdrawal from treatment. Patients & methods: A total of 42
patients who underwent at least one cycle of treatment with omalizumab were enrolled. Two groups of
relapsed and not-relapsed subjects were compared. Then, patients were divided into subgroups. Results:
Female patients relapse more frequently than male subjects. Patients who relapsed complained a long duration of disease, while patients who did not relapse had short a history of disease. Very early responders
are thought to have a high recurrence rate. Basal IgE levels were increased in early responders and cholesterol levels were high in very early responders, who relapse following withdrawal from omalizumab. High
D-dimer levels were observed in late responders. Conclusion: The identification of clinical and serological
predictors will play a pivotal role in the future management of patients treated with omalizumab.

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common skin disorder characterized by the spontaneous onset of wheals,
with associated itch and/or angioedema, lasting for six or more weeks [1]. CSU is estimated to affect around 50
million people, with symptoms that heavily impact on quality of life (2,3). To date, the pathophysiology of CSU is
only partially understood. Histamine appears to be the central mediator of CSU: a massive release of this molecule
from local basophils and mast cells occurs in the disease, reason why anti-H1 antagonists are highly effective in
treating CSU [4-8]. At the same time, an increased production of cytokines of the TH2 subset, mast cell proteases,
IL-8 as well as IFN-y, TNF-a and IL-6 cytokines, is involved in the pathogenesis of CSU [9].

Basophils and mast cells are key players in the pathogenesis of CSU, although the mechanisms underlying their
overactivation are still not fully understood. More than one mechanism of autoimmunity has been proposed for
the pathogenesis of CSU, encompassing the spectrum of type II and type I autoimmune reactions.

According to the Type II autoallergy model, IgG auto-antibodies (IgGAABs) binding the a-subunit of the
high-affinity IgE receptor FceRI are detected in a subgroup of patients with CSU. IgGAABs are responsible for
the direct basophil and mast cells activation and degranulation, which relies on complement acting as major
amplifier of the histaminergic cascade [10-12]. Autoimmunity related to CSU is based on the presence of circulating
histamine-releasing IgGAABs directed either against FceRI@ on mast cells, basophils or against IgE [13-16].

Type I-autoallergy was recently identified to be mediated by specific IgE-autoantibodies (IgEAABs) targeting
autoallergens such as thyroperoxidase, double-stranded DNA and IL-24 {10,11,13). Coagulation may be involved
in up to 50% of patients with severe CSU, that show signs of activation of the coagulation/fibrinolysis system.
Hyperexpression of tissue factor by activated eosinophils could act as initiator of the extrinsic pathway, which is
primarily implied, while the intrinsic pathway has a secondary role [17-19]. This pathologic mechanism is thought
to correlate with severity of CSU (20,21) and supported by experimental evidence that thrombin, the final enzyme

of the coagulation cascade, increases vascular permeability and induces mast cell degranulation [22,23].

Omalizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal IgG antibody targeting free IgEs, is an effective and
safe treatment for patients with CSU [1]. Omalizumab is registered by the US FDA and the EMA since 2014
for the treatment of patients aged 12 years and older (24,25). The Italian Medical Agency (AIPA) restricts the
prescription of omalizumab (300 mg/every 4 weeks) only to CSU patients with inadequate response to treatment
with antihistamines. The mechanisms for the efficacy of omalizumab in the treatment of CSU are multiple and
still have to be fully elucidated. Among the most accepted actions, omalizumab is able to induce a decrease of free
gE levels, together with the downregulation of FceRI on basophils and mast cells, which take place at different
times during omalizumab treatment (26-28). Response to omalizumab may be observed at an early or late time point
following administration of the drug, suggesting that different mechanisms affect the rate of response (29-31).

The aim of our monocentric observational study is to describe the clinical and serological features of relapsing

 

patients with CSU. In relation to their different timing of response to omalizumab, patients are classified into three
groups: very early responders (VER), early responders (ER) and late responders (LR) [30).

Patients & methods
We performed a monocentric observational study on subjects with CSU resistant to first- and second-line antihistamine therapy, eligible for treatment with omalizumab according to EAACI guidelines i.

A total of 42 (n = 42) adult patients who had completed at least one course of treatment with omalizumab for
CSU were enrolled in this study. Subjects were selected among 153 patients, 43 males and 110 females, aged. above
18 years, who consulted our dermatology department with a diagnosis of CSU (from 1 September 2016 to 31
October 2019).

A total of 116 of them (33 males and 83 females) are currently under treatment follow-up for CSU. The
disease was diagnosed following the current criteria of the EAACI guidelines, requiring a history of spontaneous
urticaria for 6 weeks or longer, with relative treatment. A total of 54 (n = 54) of our patients (15 males and 39
females) resulted unresponsive to first- and second-line therapy with second-generation ant-H1 antihistamines
and were candidate to omalizumab treatment. Patients were thoroughly informed on the risks and benefits of
the proposed treatment, as well as on the alternative treatment options, and each of them signed the informed
consent before the initiation of treatment. According to national AIFA recommendations, patients are treated with
omalizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks for a first 6-month course of therapy. Patients who experience disease relapse,

 

identified according to EAACI guidelines by a UAS7 score above 16, are candidates for additional treatment cycles.
Concomitant medications were adjusted on a case-by-case basis according to clinical response at monthly follow-up
visits. The severity of disease at baseline and the response to therapy were assessed using weekly urticaria activity
score (UAS7). According to the response to omalizumab, patients were grouped in VER (n = 10), ER (n = 13), LR
(n = 12), partial responders (PR, n = 3), and nonresponders (NR, n = 4) (Table 1).

VER were defined patients who experienced an immediate improvement of urticaria (UAS < 2) within 24 h
after the first administration of omalizumab; ER those who experienced improvement to UAS7 < 2 within 1 week
from the first administration; LR those in whom improvement occurred after 12 weeks from the beginning of
treatment; PR those who had a decrease in UAS7 score but UAS7 > 6; NR those whose UAS7 remained above
16 and mostly unchanged after completion of the first treatment cycle. Each patient was reassessed 8 weeks after
completion of treatment. Patients were then followed up for 1 year for the relapse of symptoms (UAS7 > 16).

The main purpose of our study was to identify possible clinical and serological markers of relapse after omalizumab
that could be useful in the future therapeutic management and follow-up of CSU.

Patients’ clinical data (sex, age at diagnosis, disease duration, history of atopy, autoimmune diseases, angioedema
and/or chronic inducible urticaria), laboratory parameters (antinuclear antibodies, basal total serum IgE, antithyroid
antibodies, D-dimer, fibrinogen, cholesterol, basophil activation test) and previous therapies were analyzed in order
to identify clinical and serological parameters that may be predictive of disease relapse and of the timing of response
to therapy with omalizumab.

Laboratory tests were performed at baseline and the following thresholds were used for each parameter: serum
IgE >100 kilo unit (KU)/I, D-dimer >0.90 g/ml, serum cholesterol >200 mg/dl, fibrinogen >450 mg/dl,
basophil activation test >15, antinuclear antibodies >1:160, antithyroid peroxidase antibodies >16 UI/ml and
antithyroglobulin antibodies > 100 UI/ml.

Statistical analysis

The frequency of relapse was measured considering, age, sex, clinical and laboratory investigations and response to
treatment. Specifically, response to treatment was assessed using UAS7 as one of the following three: VER, ER, and
LR. PR and NR were not taken into account for the assessments. Relapse index related to age and sex was assessed
with p-value using Mann—Whitney and Fisher's exact test while relapse index related to the different response group
was assessed with p-value using Fisher’s exact test. Due to the limited number of patients, we did not perform a
multiple regression. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

A total of 42 adult subjects, ten males and 32 females, who underwent at least one complete 6-month cycle of
treatment were included. Patients were aged mean (min;max) = 48.89 (19;83) standard deviation (SD) = 18.72 years.
A total of 28 (n = 28) out of 42 patients (66.6%) relapsed and 14 maintained remission after 1 year of follow-up
(33.3%). Though mean age was higher in patients who relapsed (mean = 51.32; SD = 18.72) than in those who
did not relapse (mean = 42.86; SD = 18.05), this difference was not statistically significant with Mann—Whitney
test (p = 0.140). Female sex was associated to a significantly higher frequency of recurrence (77.4% in respect to
male sex (36.4%) using Fisher's exact test (p = 0.024) (Table 2).

The analysis of laboratory and clinical parameters showed an association with relapse only of basophil activation
test, that was more frequently positive in patients who did not relapse compared with the relapse group, were
no positive results were assessed (Fisher’s exact test; p = 0.027). Other variables showed no statistically significant
differences between the two groups of relapse and no relapse (Table 3).

Seven patients were classified as PR or NR and excluded from further assessment. The remaining 35 patients
were assigned into three subgroups according to treatment response: VER (n = 10), ER (n = 13) and LR (n = 12).
Previous analyses were repeated for each subgroup (Table 4). A total 24 of 35 patients (68.6%) relapsed and nine of
ten VER patients (90%) relapsed suggesting a higher frequency of recurrence compared with ER and LR groups.
As far as laboratory data are concerned, values according to different types of responders are shown in Table 5.

Mean duration of disease before initiating omalizumab was 88 months (min;max = 2;480) in patients who
relapsed. All patients who did not relapse had a duration of disease ranging between 2 and 18 months.

Discussion
The pathogenesis of CSU takes into account a complexity of disease mechanisms, many of which are yet to be
understood. Autoimmunity likely plays a role both in the pathogenesis of disease and in the response to omalizumab.
The clinical observation of early response following first administration of omalizumab suggests the involvement
of still unknown immunological mechanisms in the pathogenesis of CSU and in the response to therapy [32].
Omalizumab is not considered a disease-modifying drug and, accordingly, a large proportion of patients experiences a relapse following withdrawal of treatment [33-35]. In our study, 66.6% of patients relapsed after a successful
cycle of therapy and needed further cycles of omalizumab.
Patients that do not relapse may have reached a spontaneous remission of the disease. We hypothesize that the
relapse population subgroup is mainly represented by patients with a long-standing history of CSU.

Our results show that frequency of relapse is higher in females than in males. A tendency to relapse was also
observed in relation to age, although the association was not statistically significant. From the evidence gathered,
we could infer that sex and age are relevant parameters in preclinical patient evaluation. Concurrent angioedema
or chronic inducible urticaria occurred indifferently in relapsing and nonrelapsing subjects.

According to our results, 23.8% of patients showed treatment response within 24 h (VER) and 30.9% within 1
week (ER) after the first administration of omalizumab. Interestingly, VERs seem to be also the ones to experience
high rates of recurrence after withdrawal from treatment, requiring therefore additional cycles of omalizumab. We
also focused our attention on the clinical severity of CSU, inferring that patients with high skin disease burden,
measured as number of urticarial lesions and disease persistence, are the ones to show a prompt response after the
first injection of omalizumab; these patients however also show a constant relapse rate within the first 2 months
from the end of the treatment cycle.

In accordance with our findings, Ertas et al. showed that high total serum IgE levels seem to be linked to a faster
relapse after discontinuation of omalizumab therapy in patients with CSU (36). The same study also shows that

 

timing of response to omalizumab therapy is associated with the rate of recurrence.

Our results showed high basal IgE levels (above 100 KU/I) in ER patients. These patients were also the ones
who showed frequent occurrence of relapse following the end of the cycle.

Interestingly, high cholesterol levels — over 200 mg/dl — were recorded in VERs; as already pointed out, these
patients were early relapsing patients after treatment dismission.

In addition to baseline IgE levels, also D-dimer levels are reported to be higher in responders to omalizumab
compared with nonresponders (37). In our sample, D-dimer levels were elevated above 0.90 pg/ml in LRs.

A study from Asero et al, demonstrated that elevated D-dimer levels are associated with disease severity [20],
however, at present time there are no clear data on the correlation between baseline D-dimer levels and the
response rate to omalizumab therapy [38-40]. Also, the relationship between basophil activation test and the response
to omalizumab is unclear. A recent study investigated the possible association between the therapeutic success
of omalizumab and a negative basophil activation test [40]. Another study reported positive results of basophil
activation test and autologous serum skin test in association to late response to omalizumab [41].

Our results showed basophil activation test negativity in the majority of patients, and inall patients who relapsed,
but this finding may be attributed to the limited accuracy and standardization of the techniques.

Conclusion
Current literature on CSU proposed several clinical and laboratory parameters as potential biomarkers of disease
activity and response to therapy, while little has been reported on the predictors of relapse [42].

In the era of precision medicine, researchers and clinicians must join efforts to identify all clinical and laboratory
markers that may aid in patient management. Predicting not only the response to treatment but also the risk of
relapse is necessary to predict the duration of disease and to guide choice of the best drug on a single patient basis.
Achieving a tailored therapy approach to the treatment of CSU is expected to significantly improve the quality of
life in our patients.

Chronic spontaneous urticaria is a common skin disorder characterized by the spontaneous onset of wheals
associated to pruritus and/or angioedema and lasting for 6 or more weeks.

Omalizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal IgG antibody targeting free IgE, is a safe, effective and
well-tolerated treatment for patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria.

The aim of our observational study was to describe the clinical and serological markers of relapse in chronic
spontaneous urticaria, which occurs in the majority of patients after discontinuation of omalizumab.

Patients who relapsed after one cycle of omalizumab are mostly female and may be older than not-relapsed
patients.

Patients who relapsed complained a long duration of disease before initiating omalizumab, while patients who
did not relapse had a short history of disease.

Very early responders achieve remission within 24 h of omalizumab injection but are thought to have a high
recurrence rate.

Basal IgE level are increased to > 100 KU/I in early responders, who showed response within 1 week after the first
administration of omalizumab and relapse following the end of the cycle.

High cholesterol levels > 200 mg/dl are reported in very early responders, who respond after 24 h from the first
administration of omalizumab and usually relapse following withdrawal from treatment.

High D-dimer levels >0.90 .g/ml, which is associated to disease severity in the literature, were observed in late
responders; however, the possible relation to relapse is unclear.
