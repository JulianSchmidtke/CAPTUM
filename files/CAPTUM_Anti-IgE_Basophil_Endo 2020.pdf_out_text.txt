ABSTRACT

Background: About one-half of all patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria have low or
less reactivity of the basophils to FceRI stimulation. However, the differences in the clinical
characteristics between patients who show normal and attenuated basophil reactivities to
FceRI stimulation are still unclear. Furthermore, it also remains unknown as to what factors
induce the poor reactivity of basophils to FceRI stimulation.

Objective: The aim of the study is to investigate the differences in the clinical characteristics
between patients who show normal and attenuated basophil reactivities to FceRI stimulation.
Methods: We compared the clinical characteristics, including the autologous serum skin
test-positive rates, serum concentrations of anti-IgE and anti-FceRIa autoantibodies, and the
FceRI-crosslinking ability of these autoantibodies between patients with a negative basophil
activation test (BAT) (<10% CD203c"*" basophils, n = 9) and positive BAT (>10% CD203c""
basophils, n = 13). We also monitored the changes in the 7-day urticaria activity scores after
treatment with omalizumab, as compared to the score at the baseline, between the BATpositive and BAT-negative patients.

Results: The BAT-negative patients showed a significantly higher urticaria control test

score than the BAT-positive patients (p = 0.01). There were no significant differences in

the autologous serum skin test-positive rates, concentrations of anti-IgE and anti-FeeRIa
autoantibodies, and the FceRI-crosslinking ability of these autoantibodies between the

2 groups. After treatment with omalizumab for 35 days, the score decreased to under 15
(corresponding to controlled or mild chronic spontaneous urticaria) in all of the BATnegative patients, whereas in 6 out of the 13 BAT-positive patients, the scores remained over
16 (corresponding to moderate or severe chronic spontaneous urticaria).

Conclusions: The weak reactivity of basophils to FceRI stimulation may not be due to the
desensitization of basophils by anti-IgE or anti-FceRIa autoantibodies. The time to response
to omalizumab might differ between BAT-negative and BAT-positive patients with chronic
spontaneous urticaria.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is characterized by the spontaneous occurrence of
systemic daily wheals that persist for at least 6 weeks [1]. Basophils from patients with CSU
have been shown to exhibit a bimodal response to anti-IgE activation [2]. About one-half
of CSU patients show reduced anti-IgE-induced histamine release from basophils, and are
designated as showing a negative result on the basophil activation test (BAT) (hereinafter,
BAT-negative patients). Although an earlier study suggested a link between the serum
histamine-releasing activity and the reduced response of basophils to anti-IgE stimulation
in patients with CSU, evidence has also been accumulated to suggest that the reduced
basophil response to anti-IgE stimulation can also be noted in subjects without serum
histamine-releasing activity [2, 3]. Syk deficiency has been shown to be more common in
BAT-negative patients than in BAT-positive patients, cold urticaria patients, atopic patients,
or healthy donors (p < 0.05) [4]. It has been shown that in some patients with CSU, anti-IgE
or anti-FceRI a-chain (FceRIa) autoantibodies (AAbs) induce downregulation of Syk in the
eripheral blood basophils [4]. We previously demonstrated that the ability of the anti-IgE
AAbs to induce FceRI crosslinking differed significantly between nonatopic healthy subjects
and CSU patients [5]. Yanase et al. [6] mentioned in their review, that basophils in CSU

 

atients appear to be in a constant state of mild activation and continuously release small
amounts of histamine.

It has been suggested that a positive basophil histamine release assay (BHRA) and positive
autologous serum skin test (ASST) are predictive ofa slow response to omalizumab in patients
with CSU [7]. These assays are used to detect serum AAbs directed against either cell-bound
IgE or unoccupied FceRIo [7]. Furthermore, the inability of the serum from patients with CSU
to upregulate CD203c expression on the peripheral blood basophils of healthy subjects has
been reported to be correlated with the clinical response to omalizumab [8]. These findings
suggest that patients with CSU who have some histamine-releasing factors, including AAbs
against FceRIa and IgE in their sera show a slow or weak response to omalizumab therapy.
Therefore, we hypothesized that the low reactivity of basophils to FceRI stimulation might be
due to desensitization of the basophils by anti-IgE and/or anti-FceRIa AAbs, and that BATnegative patients may show a relatively slow or weak response to omalizumab.

Patient enrollment

Twenty-two consecutive patients with CSU who were receiving treatment with omalizumab
(15 females and 7 males; age range, 24 to 87 years) were recruited for this study between
April 2017 and August 2018. The characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table

1. The majority of patients were referred by doctors in private practice to the outpatient
clinic of Nihon University Hospital. Of the 22 patients, 21 had already received treatment
with high-dose H1-antihistamines. None of the patients had were received treatment with
systemic corticosteroids or cyclosporine within the previous 3 weeks. We also enrolled 20
nonatopic healthy control (NC) subjects (8 females and 12 males; age range, 23 to 64 years)
with no history of urticaria, asthma, allergic diseases, or autoimmune diseases as negative
controls for the measurement of the anti-IgE and anti-FceRIa AAbs concentrations, and also
measurement of the ability of anti-FceRIa and anti-IgE AAbs to induce FceRI crosslinking in
an in vitro elicitation test (Table 1).

Definitions and study protocol

The diagnosis of CSU was made according to the classification of the European Academy of
Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network
(GA[2] LEN), the European Dermatology Forum (EDF), and the World Allergy Organization
(WAO) [9]. The 7-day urticaria activity score (UAS7) is a patient-reported scoring system that
captures the severity of pruritus and the number of hives appearing during one week [10].
The intensity of pruritus (range, 0 [none] to 3 [severe]) and the number of hives (range, 0
[none] to 3 [>50 hives]) were recorded daily (maximum, 6 points per day). The scores were
then summed for 1 week to represent the UAS7 scale, (0-42). Urticaria control test (UCT) is a
system that evaluates the status of urticaria for past 4 weeks by asking 4 questions. The score
ranges from 0 to 16, and the larger the number, the better the state [11]. The serum IgE levels,
basophil counts were checked by blood test.

Autologous serum skin test
The ASST was performed using 50 wL of the patient's own serum intradermally injected into
the flexor aspect of the forearm; 50 uL of saline was injected 3-5 cm away as a control. The

results were measured after 30 minutes. If the serum-injected site manifested a wheal with
a diameter of 1.5 mm greater than that of the saline-injected site, the result was considered
positive [12]. According to the EAACI/GA(2) LEN task force consensus report [12],
antihistamines were discontinued for 2-3 days prior to the ASST.

Basophil activation test

The Allergenicity Kit (Beckman Coulter Inc, Brea, CA, USA) was used for quantifying the
expression of CD203c on the basophils. Heparinized whole blood was incubated with
anti-FceRI antibody (clone CRA1, BioAcademia, Osaka, Japan; 3 g/mL), anti-IgE antibody
(clone E124-2-8D, Beckman Coulter Inc.; 10 g/mL), N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-Lphenylalanine (fMLP) (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany; 1 1g/mL) or the negative
control substance (phosphate-buffer saline), as indicated, for 15 minutes. PC7-conjugated
anti-CD3, FITC-conjugated anti-CRTH2, and PE-conjugated anti-CD203c antibodies were
also added during the reaction. The samples were analyzed using the Gallios flow cytometer
(Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA, USA) and FlowJo software (TreeStar, Woodburn, OR, USA).
Basophils were identified on the basis of the forward and side scatter characteristics, negative
expression of CD3 and positive expression of CRTH2 on the cells. Activated basophils were
identified by the upregulated expression of CD203c as compared to that on the unstimulated
cells (negative control). At least 500 basophils were analyzed in each assay.

Isolation of IgG fraction from serum

IgG was purified from sera of patients with CSU and NC subjects using Ab-Rapid SPiN EX
(ProteNova, Kagawa, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The purified IgG was
reconstituted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using Amicon centrifugal filter units
(Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). The final concentrations of the purified IgG were
diluted to one-sixth of the serum IgG concentrations.

Measurement of concentrations of anti-FceRla AAbs

The truncated human FceRIa ectodomain (4172 amino acids; rh soluble FceRIa) was secreted
from transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells as described [5]. Secreted rh soluble FceRIa.

was purified from the culture supernatant of the cells using mouse anti-FceRIa (clone CRA2,
BioAcademia) [13]. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting anti-human
FceRIa AAbs was performed as previously described [5, 14-17] with the exception that a standard
curve for IgG anti-FceRIo was generated using humanized anti-FceRIa mAb (clone CRA2, isotype
human IgG1) [18]. Briefly, 1 1g/mL of purified recombinant soluble FceRIJa proteins [19] in sodium
carbonate, pH 9.6 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA), were used to coat polystyrene microwells
ofan ELISA plate (Maxisorp; Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) in duplicates and were incubated
overnight at 4°C. The plate was washed 4 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST)

and then blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature.

After washing, the purified IgG from the sera of patients with CSU or NC subjects were added

at a 1:10 dilution with PBS to each well, then incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. After
washing, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-human IgG mAb (clone G18-145; BD
Pharmingen, Franklin, NJ, USA) was added to each well at a 1:10,000 dilution for measuring its

 

concentration of total IgG, then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The reactions in the
wells were developed with hydrogen peroxide plus 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine in 100 mM
citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 5.0 (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), and their absorbances were
monitored at 450 nm and 570 nm using a Multiskan GO microplate spectrophotometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Yokohama, Japan) after the addition of 2 N sulfuric acid. The linear region of the
standard curve was used to quantify the anti- FceRIa in the purified IgG.

Measurement of concentrations of anti-IgE AAbs

An ELISA was used to detect anti-IgE AAbs, as previously described [5, 20-23]. Briefly, the
polystyrene microwells of an ELISA plate (Maxisorp) were coated with human myeloma

IgE (1 g/mL in sodium carbonate pH 9.6, Calbiochem) and incubated overnight at 4°C.
Unbound protein was removed by 4 washes with PBST. Free binding sites were blocked by
incubation with 10% FBS in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing, the purified
IgG from the sera of patients with CSU or NC subjects were added at a 1:10 dilution with PBS
to each well, which were then incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. After washing,
HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG mAb (clone G18-145) was added to each well at a 1:10,000
dilution, which was then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The reactions in the
wells were developed as mentioned above. The quantity of reactive IgG was calculated
using standard amounts of purified human IgG (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories,
West Grove, PA, USA) ranging from 0.775 ng/mL to 50 ng/mL bound directly to the plates.
To normalize the data among the plates, one specific donor's anti-IgE level was measured
repeatedly on all of the plates.

Preparation of RS-ATL8 cells and RBL-NL4 cells

RS-ATL8 cells or RBL-NL4 cells (2.0 x 10° cells/1000 j1L/well) [24] were cultured in MEM
containing 10% FBS, 1% GlutaMAX-I, 100-U/mL penicillin, 100-11g/mL streptomycin, 0.5-mg/
mL geneticin, and 0.2-mg/mL hygromycin B on a Costar 24-well clear tissue culture-treated
multiple well plate (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA) at 37°C for 2 days in a 5% CO, incubator
[5, 24]. The cells were replated and cultured as described above for an additional 2 days. The
cells were then replated on a 96-well plate at 2 x 10* cells/50 pL/well and cultured at 37°C
overnight in a 5% CO, incubator.

Measurement of the ability of anti-FceRla and anti-IgE AAbs to induce FceRI
crosslinking using an in vitro elicitation test (modified EXiLE test)

An in vitro elicitation test was modified from a previously described method reported by us
[5, 24]. The test was performed by assessing an EXiLE test using human FceRIoPy2 genesand nuclear factor of activated T-cell-responsive luciferase reporter gene-introduced rat
basophilic leukemia cells (RS-ATL8 cells) [25]. The purified IgG was replaced with MEM
containing 10% FBS, 1% GlutaMAX-I, 100-U/mL penicillin, 100-1g/mL streptomycin,
0.5-mg/mL geneticin, and 0.2-mg/mL hygromycin B, using Amicon centrifugal filter units
(Merck Millipore). To measure the ability of anti-FceRIa AAbs to induce FceRI crosslinking,
50 ul of purified IgG (equivalent to a 1:6 dilution of the serum IgG levels) obtained from
CSU patients was added to each well and the samples were incubated at 37°C for 3 hours in
a 5% CO; incubator. To measure the ability of anti-IgE AAbs to induce FceRI-crosslinking,
the purified IgG was preincubated with well-coated rh soluble FceRIo. (1 pg/mL), and the
supernatants were sequentially incubated with well-coated rh soluble FceRIa twice. Then,
the supernatants were applied to IgE-sensitized RS-ATLS8 cells. Fifty pL of luciferase substrate
solution containing a cell lysis reagent (ONE Glo, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was added
to the cells, and the chemiluminescence was measured using a Centro LB 960 plate reader
(Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Standard curves for the fold inductions
in luciferase fluorescence were induced by mouse anti-human FceRIa mAb (clone CRA1)

or rabbit anti-human IgE Ab (Dako, Santa Clora, CA, USA). The luciferase expression

levels were represented as the fold increase in light units compared with the results in
nonstimulated cells. The minimum concentration of CRAI or rabbit anti-human IgE Ab that
induced a significantly higher intensity of luciferase fluorescence than that observed in the
nonstimulated wells was used to define as the sensitivity of the EXiLE test.

Statistical analysis

We compared continuous variables between the 2 groups using the Mann-Whitney U test; to
compare categorical variables, a 2-sided Fisher exact test was used. Basophil counts and BATs
before and after omalizumab were compared using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank
test. A p value was considered significant at p < 0.05. The data analyses were performed using
Prism version 7 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).

RESULTS

We enrolled 22 patients with CSU in this study. The clinical and laboratory data of the
patients are shown in Table 2. The patients with CSU were divided into 2 groups according

to the results on the BAT, namely, the basophil activation rates after stimulation with
anti-FceRIa monoclonal antibody (clone CRA1), as previously described [26]. Patients in
whom the percentage of CD203c's" basophils in the BAT remained at <10% were defined as
BAT-negative (n = 9), while those in whom the number of CD203c"*' basophils increased to
>10% were defined as BAT-positive (n = 13), as previously described [26, 27]. The response
characteristics of the CSU patients are summarized in Table 3. We found that there was no
significant difference in the UAS7 between the BAT-negative and BAT-positive patients, but
that the UCT score was significantly higher in the BAT-negative than in the BAT-positive
patients (p= 0.010). No significant differences were found in the age, sex, disease duration,
positivity rates of ASST, peripheral blood basophil count, peripheral blood eosinophil count,
serum total IgE levels, positivity rate of antinuclear antibody, concentrations of anti-IgE AAbs
(Fig. 1A) and anti-FceRIa AAbs (Fig. 1B) concentrations or in the FceRI-crosslinking ability of
these AAbs (Fig. 1C, D).

Fig. 1. Comparison of the serum concentrations of anti-IgE AAbs (A) and anti-FceRla AAbs (B), and the FceRI-crosslinking ability of these AAbs (C, D) among
nonatopic control (NC) subjects (n = 20), BAT-negative patients (n = 9), and BAT-positive patients (n = 13). The luciferase expression levels are represented as the
fold increase in light units as compared to the results from the nonstimulated cells. Statistical analyses were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. AAbs,
autoantibodies; BAT, basophil activation test. BAT-Neg. Pt., BAT-negative patients; BAT-Pos. Pt., BAT-positive patients.

Omalizumab 300 mg was administered by subcutaneous injection 3 times at 4-week intervals
(arrows in Fig. 2A). The first day on which a response was detected was defined as the first
of 7 continuous days on which the UAS7 score was 6 or less [7]. Venous blood samples

were collected before the start of omalizumab treatment and on day 84 after the start of
omalizumab treatment. At the end of 84 days of treatment, the UAS7 was <6 in 16 patients
(73%) (Fig. 2A). The UAS7 was significantly decreased on days 7, 35, and 84 as compared to
that on day 0 in both the BAT-negative and BAT-positive patients (Fig. 2B, C). Furthermore,
the UAS7 was significantly lower on days 35 and 84 as compared to that on day 7 in the BATnegative patients (Fig. 2B), whereas in the BAT-positive patients, a significant difference in
the UAS7 score was only observed between day 7 and day 84 (Fig. 2C). After omalizumab
treatment for 35 days, the UAS score decreased to under 15 (corresponding to controlled or
mild CSU; Fig. 2B) in all of the BAT-negative patients, whereas in 6 out of the 13 BAT-positive
patients, the scores remained over 16 (corresponding to moderate or severe CSU; Fig. 2C).
Significant increase in the peripheral blood basophil counts after treatment with omalizumab
was found in both the BAT-negative and BAT- positive patients (Fig. 3A, p = 0.0391; Fig. 3B,
p= 0.0186; respectively). Significant increase of the percentages of CD203c'#* basophils in
response to FceRI stimulation was seen after treatment with omalizumab in both the BATnegative and BAT- positive patients (Fig. 3C, p = 0.0156; Fig. 3D, p = 0.0156; respectively).

Although a significant increase in the percentage of CD203c"8" basophils in response to fMLP
stimulation was seen after treatment with omalizumab in the BAT-positive patients (Fig. 3F,
p= 0.0313), no such difference was observed in the BAT-negative patients (Fig. 3E).

DISCUSSION

We demonstrated that after treatment with omalizumab for 35 days, all of the BAT-negative
patients showed a decrease of the UAS corresponding to a controlled or mild severity

state (Fig. 2B), while 6 out of the 13 BAT-positive patients (46%) still showed scores
corresponding to moderate or severe CSU (Fig. 2C). Although the precise reason(s) is
unclear, the significantly lower UCT score in the BAT-positive patients as compared to the
BAT-negative patients (Table 3) could be one possible reason. The findings must be verified
ina larger population. Palacios et al. [8] and Gericke et al. [7] reported that CSU patients
with basophil-activating serum activity are less likely to show a complete and rapid response

Fig. 3. Comparison of the peripheral blood basophil counts (A, n = 8; B, n= 11), proportion (%) of CD203"#" basophils after FceRI aggregation (C, n= 7; D, n= 7),
and proportion (%) of CD203"#" basophils following N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP) stimulation (E, n = 4 ; F, n = 6) in the BAT-negative
and BAT-positive patients before (day 0) and after treatment with omalizumab (day 84). Statistical analyses were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. BAT,

to omalizumab, respectively. The discrepancy between the findings of the aforementioned
authors [7, 8] and our results suggests that the presence of histamine-releasing activity in
the serum of BHRA-positive and ASST-positive patients might not induce desensitization
of basophils to IgE-mediated stimulation, resulting in the weak activation of basophils in

response to FceRI stimulation.

In our study, no significant differences in the positivity rate of ASST were found between the
BAT-negative and BAT-positive patients (Table 3). Thus, the positivity rate of ASST showed
no correlation with the reactivity of basophils to FceRI stimulation in the BAT. Furthermore,
the serum concentrations of anti-IgE and anti-FceRIa AAbs, and the FceRI-crosslinking
ability of these AAbs were not significantly different between the BAT-negative and BATpositive patients (Fig. 1). Thus, anti-IgE and anti-FceRla AAbs might not be necessary or
sufficient to induce weak reactivity of the basophils to FceRI stimulation. Another serologic
factor may be autoreactive IgE [28, 29] and/or the so-called cytokinergic IgE [30, 31]. In

our study, a significant increase in the percentages of CD203c''#' basophils in response to
FceRI stimulation after treatment with omalizumab was seen in both the BAT-negative and
BAT-positive patients (Fig. 3C, p = 0.0156; Fig. 3D, p = 0.0156; respectively). Furthermore,
most BAT-negative patients converted to BAT-positive after treatment with omalizumab. The
basophil surface expression levels of FceRIa. has been reported to decrease significantly after
treatment with omalizumab [32]. Thus, omalizumab increases the reactivity of basophils to
FceRI stimulation by changing intracellular signaling. While a significant difference in the

percentage of CD203c'"*" basophils following f{MLP stimulation between before and after

 

the treatment with omalizumab was seen in the BAT-positive patients (Fig. 3F), no such
difference was seen in the BAT-negative patients (Fig. 3E), A previous study demonstrated
that utilization of fMLP did not reveal any differences in basophil activation between the BATnegative and BAT-positive patients [26]. Further studies are therefore required. Omalizumab
binds to free IgE and may also bind to autoreactive IgE. If autoantigens were present in the
skin tissues of patients with CSU, but not in healthy donors, the suggestion by Vonakis et al.
[2] that the anti-IgE response of the basophils from patients with CSU is not related to the
presence of serologic factors would be reasonable.

Limitations of the study are that all the data are derived from an open observational study
without controls. Another weakness is that the number of patients is small. The findings
must be confirmed in a sufficiently large population. Furthermore, the majority of patients
with CSU (91%) receive treatment with high doses of H1 antihistamines (Table 1); the
possible influence of high-dose H1 antihistamine therapy on the efficacy of omalizumab
cannot be excluded.

In conclusion, we demonstrated that the time to response to omalizumab might differ
between BAT-negative and BAT-positive patients with CSU. Further studies are required to
identify factors that induce weak FceRI-mediated basophil activation.
