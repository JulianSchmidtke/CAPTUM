Abstract

Background: Omalizumab is a third-line treatment for chronic spontaneous urticaria
(CSU). However, the real-life data on the impact of omalizumab on CSU-related quality of life (QoL) remain scarce.

Objectives: To investigate the impact of omalizumab on QoL and its predictors in
CSU. A retrospective cohort study was done. The response to therapy was evaluated
using urticaria activity score over 7 days (UAS7) and urticaria control test (UCT); the
impairment in QoL was assessed using dermatology life quality index (DLQI) and
chronic urticaria quality of life questionnaire (CU-Q2oL).

Results: Forty-two patients were included. All scores improved from baseline to first
month and remained stable at the third month of treatment (p < .001). The gender,
age, and angioedema had no significant effect on QoL, but the complete responders
(UAS7:0-1) had better improvement rates in all scores compared to others. The baseline UAS7, DLQI, and CU-Q2oL scores were lower at the baseline in complete
responders (p = .0001).

Conclusions: A rapid and continual improvement in QoL was obtained with omalizumab
treatment. A better UAS7, UCT, DLQI, and CU-Q2oL score at the baseline might be a

predictor of a better response to omalizumab and more improvement in QoL.

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is characterized by the recurrence of wheals and/or angioedema for >6 weeks in the absence of
any identifiable triggering factor (Zuberbier et al., 2018). The chronic
and relapsing course of the disease, unpredictability of the recurrences, occasionally disfiguring lesions usually pose a heavy psychosocial burden on the patients (Balp et al., 2018; Maurer et al., 2017).
Previous studies have reported a higher risk of anxiety, depression,
and sleep difficulties in CSU compared to patients with psoriasis and

healthy controls (Balp et al., 2018; Engin, Uguz, Yilmaz, Ozdemir, &

ties, personal relationships, looks, work, and school life, has also been
repeatedly demonstrated (Baiardini et al., 2011; Liu, Yao, Si, Xiong, &
Zhou, 2012; Staubach et al., 2006). The updated CSU guidelines recommend to evaluate the impact on QoL in patient with CSU at every
visit with CSU-specific instruments such as chronic urticaria quality
of life questionnaire (CU-Q2oL) (Beck, Bernstein, & Maurer, 2017;
Zuberbier et al., 2018).

The current first line treatment for CSU is nonsedating antihistamines at standard doses. The antihistamines might be used up to fourfold of standard doses in patients unresponsive to first line treatment

(Zuberbier et al., 2018). Moreover, omalizumab, a third line treatment

alternative, has expanded the armamentarium for the treatment of
CSU and led to significant improvement in the care of patients with
CSU (Giménez-Arnau, Velasco, Armario Hita, Labrador-Horrillo, &
Silvestre Salvador, 2016; Tharp et al., 2019). Despite the growing evidence from clinical and real-world studies showing the effectiveness
and safety of omalizumab in CSU, the impact of omalizumab treatment on CSU-related QoL has not been studied in detail (Tharp et al.,
2019). Therefore, we aimed to investigate the changes in QoL measures following treatment with omalizumab and determine possible
related clinical or demographic factors in this retrospective cohort

study.

2 | MATERIAL AND METHODS

A retrospective cohort study was done to investigate the effects of
omalizumab on the QoL of the patients with CSU. The study protocol
was approved by the institutional review board (Approval number:
09.2018.233).

In our specialized urticaria outpatient clinic, the patients with
uncontrolled CSU (urticaria control test [UCT] score < 12) despite the
regular use of antihistamines up to fourfold of licensed doses for
>6 months are treated with omalizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks. The
demographic (age, gender, smoking status, comorbidities, body mass
index, history of atopy) and disease characteristics (duration, coexistence of angioedema and chronic inducible urticaria, response to previous treatments, family history) of the patients are recorded at the
baseline visit. Then, the patients are regularly followed up every
4-8 weeks depending on the response to treatment. The response to
treatment and the CSU-related QoL of the patients are evaluated
using patient-reported outcomes including urticaria activity score over
7 days (UAS7), UCT, CU-Q2oL, and dermatology life quality index
(DLQI) at every follow-up visit.

The UAS score consists of daily scores for severity of itching and
number of urticarial lesions. It provides a daily score ranging 0-6 and
a weekly score between O and 42. The higher scores indicate more
severe disease (Jauregui Presa et al., 2014; Mtynek et al., 2008). The
treatment response is recorded as complete response (CR; UAS < 2),
good disease control (GDC; 2 < UAS7 < 6), partial response (PR;
UAS7 > 6, but 210 point of decrease from baseline), or no response
(NR; no change or increase in UAS7) (Asero et al., 2017; Kaplan
et al., 2016).

The UCT is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of four
questions evaluating the control of symptoms control during the last
4 weeks. A score between 0 and 16 is obtained and a score of 12 or
more means well-controlled disease (Weller et al., 2014). The minimal
important difference (MID) for UAS7 and UCT scores is 10 and
3 points, respectively (Mathias, Crosby, Rosen, & Zazzali, 2014;
Ohanyan et al., 2017).

The DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire assessing the impact of skin
conditions on the QoL of the patients. It has been used in numerous
skin diseases including chronic urticaria and evaluates six different

aspects (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and

school, personal relationships, and treatment) of QoL. The final score
ranges between O and 30. The higher scores imply more severe of
impairment in QoL (Finlay & Khan, 1994). The minimal clinically
important difference (MCID) for DLQI score was estimated to be
4 (Basra, Salek, Camilleri, Sturkey, & Finlay, 2015; Shikiar, Harding,
Leahy, & Lennox, 2005).

The CU-Q2oL is a 23-item instrument that specifically evaluates
the impact chronic urticaria on QoL. It provides scores on six different
subscales (pruritus, swelling, impact on life activities, sleep problems,
limits, and looks). The raw total and subscale scores are converted into
scaled scores using linear transformations and the final score for each
subscale ranges between 20 and 100. Higher scores reflect more
impairment in QoL (Baiardini et al., 2005).

The validity and reliability of the Turkish versions of all scales and
questionnaires have been demonstrated previously (Kocatiirk et al.,
2012; Kocatiirk Géncii et al., 2016; Oztiirkcan, Ermertcan, Eser, &
Sahin, 2006).

The medical records of all patients treated with omalizumab for
CSU between 2017 and 2018 were reviewed. The patients who had
baseline, first, and third month records for all indices were included in
the study. The demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics
were recorded.

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of
demographic and clinical characteristics on QoL improvement. The
secondary objectives were the mean absolute change from baseline
UAS7, UCT, DLQI, CU-Q2oL, and subscale scores at the end of first
and third months, the number of patients achieving the MID levels for
UAS7, UCT, and DLQI scores at the end of first and third months of
treatment. The number of patients with an UCT score 2 12 or DLQI
score of 0-1 at different time points and response to treatment were

also determined.

2.1 | Statistical analysis

Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were shown as
frequency distribution for discrete random variables and mean + SD for
the continuous random variables. Univariate general linear model was
used to evaluate the effect of demographic and clinical characteristics
of the patients on disease severity and QoL during the follow-up period.
Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare the mean
score measurements between different time points. p < .05 was considered as significant. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, Inc.,

Chicago, IL) v15.0 was used for the statistical analysis.

3 | RESULTS

A total of 42 patients were included in the study. The mean age of the
study group was 39.45. The mean UAS7 and UCT scores prior to
treatment were 26.2 and 5.9, respectively. The baseline demographic

and clinical characteristics of the patients were detailed in Table 1.

At the time of the final analysis, a CR was observed in 23 (54.8%)
patients. A GDC, PR, and NR were seen in 14 (33.3%), 2 (4.8%), and
3 (7.1%) patients, respectively.

The effect of age (s36 vs. >36), gender, duration of disease (<1
vs. >1 year), presence of angioedema, and treatment response (CR vs.
others) on the mean UAS, UCT, DLQI, and CU-Q2oL scores and mean
changes from baseline to first and third months of treatment were analyzed. A statistically significant difference was found only between complete responders and others. The patients showing CR to treatment had
significantly higher UCT scores and lower UAS7, DLQI, and CU-Q2oL
scores at the baseline compared to others. The mean change in the UAS7,
UCT, DLQI, and CU-Q2oL from baseline was also significantly higher at
the end of first and third months in this group of patients (p < .001).

Of note, although the older patients (>36) had higher UAS7,
CU-Q2oL, and lower UCT scores at the baseline, their mean scores
were better than younger patients (<36) at the end of first and third
months (p > .05). Albeit statistically insignificant, the rate of improvement in UAS7, CU-Q2oL, and UCT scores also tend to be better in older
patients at the end of third month of treatment (p > .05) (Figure 1).

The mean change in UAS7 score from baseline to first and third
months was 17.48 and 22.48, respectively (p < .001). The mean
change in UCT score from baseline was 6.63 and 8.02 at the end of
first and third months, respectively (p < .001). The number of patients
with an UCT score 212 was 2 (4.7%), 31 (73.8%), and 35 (83.3%) at
the baseline, first, and third months, respectively (p < .001).

The mean DLQI-total score was 12.1 at the baseline. The mean
change in DLQI score from baseline was 6.4 and 7.5 at the end of
first and third months, respectively (p < .001). A significant improvement was also observed in all DLQI subscale scores (p < .001). The
changes in DLQI total and subscale scores were shown in Figure 2.
The number of patients with a DLQI-total score of 0/1 was 1 (2.3%),
19 (45.2%), and 20 (47.6%) at the baseline, first, and third months,
respectively (p < .001).

The number of the patients achieving MID/MCID levels for UAS7,
UCT, and DLQI at the first month was 33 (78.5%), 34 (80.9%), and
28 (66.6%), respectively. At the third month, the numbers further
increased to 39 (92.8%), 39 (92.8%), and 29 (69%), respectively.

The mean CU-Q2oL-total score was 54.4 at the baseline. The
mean change in CU-Q2olL-total score from baseline 16.52 and
20.12 at the end of first and third months, respectively (p < .001). In
a similar manner, all subscale scores significantly improved with treatment (p < .001). The changes in CU-Q2oL total and subscale scores

were demonstrated in Figure 3.

4 | DISCUSSION

Omalizumab is an effective and well-tolerated treatment alternative
for patients with CSU as shown in the earlier studies; however, reallife studies investigating the omalizumab-induced improvements in
the QoL of the patients with CSU are sparse. The present study is a
real-life study aimed at investigating the effects of omalizumab on
QoL and its clinical and demographic predictors, with relatively high
number of patients. The results demonstrate that a rapid, significant,
and sustainable improvement in all aspects of QoL can be obtained
with omalizumab treatment in patients with CSU. The use of both
DLQI and CU-Q2oL and detailed analysis of clinical determinants of
improvement in QoL make our results more valuable.

Owing to its unpredictable, chronic, and relapsing nature, CSU commonly causes a negative impact on QoL of the patients. Furthermore,
impairment in QoL was the main predictor of psychologic comorbidities
(Zachariae, Zachariae, Ibsen, Mortensen, & Wulf, 2004). Although the
burden of CSU on the affected individuals was often underestimated,
the negative impact of CSU on QoL was comparable to that of atopic
dermatitis, psoriasis, and even coronary artery disease (Balp et al., 2018;
Grob, Revuz, Ortonne, Auquier, & Lorette, 2005; Mendelson et al., 2017;
O'Donnell, Lawlor, Simpson, Morgan, & Greaves, 1997). The QoL impairment was evident in various aspects including home management, social
functions, emotions, sleep, rest, and work (Engin et al., 2008; O'Donnell
et al., 1997). The existing studies in the literature have reported mean
DLQI and CU-Q2oL scores of 6.62-9.93 and 33.6-36, respectively (Dias
et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2012; Maurer, Abuzakouk, et al., 2017). The higher
mean DLQI (12.1) and CU-Q2oL (54.4) scores in the current study might
be attributed to the inclusion of patients with more severe and recalcitrant disease. Consistently with the existing data, the most affected subdomains were work/school and symptoms/feelings for DLQI, and sleep
and pruritus for CU-Q2oL in the present study (Dias et al., 2016; Liu
et al., 2012; Maurer, Abuzakouk, et al., 2017).

In addition to objective and subjective disease severity scores,
assessment of the improvement in QoL through validated and
patient-reported scales is an important part of the evaluation of
response to treatment. Previously, desloratadine and fexofenadine
have been shown to significantly improve the QoL in patients with
CSU (Lachapelle et al., 2006; Thompson, Finn, & Schoenwetter, 2000).

The impact of omalizumab on QoL has been investigated in patients

participated to Phase Ill clinical trials (Finlay et al., 2017; Maurer et al.,

2017; Staubach et al., 2018). A mean decrease of 4.49-10.3 points in
DLQlI-total has been reported at Week 12 (Finlay et al., 2017; Maurer,
Sofen, et al., 2017). Similarly, the mean change in DLQI in our study
group was 7.5 at third month. The proportion of the patients achieving
the MCID of 4 points or more in DLQI-total score at Week 12 was
74.1-77.1% in previous studies, accordingly 69% of our study group
reached the MCID or more at Week 12 (Finlay et al., 2017). Accordingly
with our results, the improvement in DLQI subscales was significantly
better compared to placebo group (Finlay et al., 2017; Staubach et al.,
2018), except for personal relationships subscale was not different from
placebo group in one study (Finlay et al., 2017).

In contrast to clinical trials, the impact of omalizumab on QoL was
seldom evaluated in real-life studies. A recent systematic review has

reported that QoL was assessed in only 13% of the real-life studies on

omalizumab in CSU (Bernstein et al., 2018). Furthermore, most of the
previous studies are limited by the small number of patients and lack
of detailed analysis of subscales. A total 89 of patients with CSU were
enrolled in seven studies (n = 2-28) and a significant improvement in
DLQI scores was obtained following omalizumab treatment (Kai,
Flohr, & Grattan, 2014; Kaplan, Joseph, Maykut, Geba, & Zeldin,
2008; Lefévre, Deleuran, & Vestergaard, 2013; Marcelino et al., 2018;
Savic et al., 2015; Subramaniyan & Chopra, 2016; Vestergaard &
Deleuran, 2010). Accordingly with our results, the decrease in DLQI
scores was most significant during the first month of treatment and
then stabilized as long as the treatment is continued (Kai et al., 2014;
Lefévre et al., 2013; Vestergaard & Deleuran, 2010). More recently, a
multicenter study of 132 patients has reported a mean change of
19.6 in DLQI-total score at sixth month of treatment (Bulur et al.,

(Curto-Barredo, Riba Archilla, Roura Vives, Pujol, & Giménez-Arnau,
2018). Moreover, the current study has demonstrated that lower disease
activity (lower UAS7 score) and better disease control (higher UCT score)
at the baseline are predictors of better improvement in all aspects of QoL.
Another novel observation in our study was the statistically insignificant
trend of better improvement rate in disease severity, symptom control,
and QoL in older patients (>36) with time. Although speculative, this could
be explained with younger patients being more active in social, school, and
work life; thus prolonged treatment duration and required hospital visits
for injections might affect them more. Self-administration of omalizumab
at home, as described previously (Denman et al., 2016; Ghazanfar & Thomsen, 2018), might be a good alternative for such patients. It would also
be interesting to evaluate the effect of age on patient reported outcomes
in larger studies with a longer follow-up period.

The present study was limited by its retrospective design. Another
limitation is the relatively short follow-up period of 3 months. Considering that the CR to omalizumab can be seen up to 6 months, a longer
follow-up period could have provided even better results. The key
strength of this study is the combined use of multiple patientreported tools to evaluate different aspects of Qol in real-life settings
with a relatively large group of patients.

In conclusion, the current findings add to a growing body of literature on the positive impact of omalizumab on Qol of the patients with
CSU. Moreover, this study has demonstrated, for the first time to our
knowledge, that lower disease activity and better disease control at
the baseline predict a higher rate of improvement in QoL. Further
investigation is recommended to determine the possible demographic,

clinical, and laboratory markers of response and improvement in QoL.
