1 | INTRODUCTION

Abstract

Background: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a distressing skin disease. Family
clustering and heterogeneity in the onset and progression indicate that susceptibility
to CSU is a complex trait. In this study, we performed haplotype analysis for one of
the key player gene, IL17RA, for CSU to test the association with disease susceptibility and severity.

Methodology: The study included 70 CSU patients and 30 healthy controls. The severity of the disease was evaluated by autologous serum skin test (ASST) and urticaria activity score (UAS). ASST test was done and quality of life was assessed using
a questionnaire. Allelic discrimination analysis for rs4819554 and rs879577 was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction technology.

Results: Carriers of rs4819554*G were more prone to develop CSU than its counterpart (P= .039), while rs4819554*A allele displayed more severe phenotype in the form
of more prolonged disease duration (P = .040), concurrent angioedema (P < .001),
higher level of treatment (P < .001), and higher score of quality of life (P < .001).
Additionally, homozygote patients with rs879577*CC were associated with angioedema (P < .001). Haplotype analysis revealed that cohorts with both rs4819554*A
and rs879577*T conferred protection against developing CSU (OR = 0.07, 95%
Cl =0.01-0.32, P = .001).

Conclusion: Our results showed that IL17RA gene polymorphisms might contribute

to the increased susceptibility to CSU.

Chronic urticaria is a distressing skin disease characterized by recurrent itching and hives with or without angioedema, with symptoms persisting for more than 6 weeks without a known cause.! The
condition lays a significant emotional and economic burden on the

patient.? It is classified according to whether it is inducible or not

is seen between 20 and 40 years of age. The duration of the disease
is generally 1-5 years but is likely to be longer in more severe cases.
CSU has major effect on quality of life (QoL), with sleep deprivation
and psychiatric comorbidity being frequent. Non-sedating antihista
mines are the mainstay of symptomatic therapy.*

Different biologic components including inflammation, immunity, and coagulation were suggested to be the leading factors which
cause mast cell and basophil degranulation with consequent wheal
formation and angioedema,? each of which may contribute by an additive weight in each patient. However, the exact initiative mechanisms of chronic spontaneous urticaria are still poorly understood.
CSU shows both autoimmune and allergic disease characteristics.
Histamine-releasing autoantibodies directed against FceRI or IgE
were detected in only one-third of CSU patients, suggesting that
other circulating mediators, including cytokines, may be involved in
its pathophysiology. Most autoimmune and/or allergic diseases are
caused by an imbalance between cytokines and T lymphocyte subgroups.° The determination of the dominant cytokine pattern and T
lymphocyte subgroup in CSU patients could be the key explaining
this complicated immunopathogenesis.’

Growing body of researches showed an association with autoimmunity in approximately 45 percent of patients, evidenced
by the presence of autoantibodies.® These autoantibodies can
be detected in vivo by the autologous serum skin test (ASST).”
Additionally, an aberrant T-cell-mediated immune response is crucial in the development of CSU."° Interleukin-17 (IL-17) contains
six distinct isoforms (IL-17 A, B, C, D, E, and F) and five receptors
(IL-17 RA, B, C, D, and SEF).*? IL-17 is produced by T helper 17
(Th17) subsets of CD4+ T cell. IL-17 plays an important role in the
development and progression of inflammatory and autoimmune
disease.° Cytokines produced from T lymphocytes and natural
killer (NK) cells form a cascade of reactions which might contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of CSU."° The IL17RA receptor is expressed in many types of cells, including epithelial cells,
fibroblasts, and lymphocytes.”* Increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-17 family members have also been
found in the circulation of patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and bullous skin diseases.‘>"??
Blocking the action of IL-17 appeared to be favorable in the treatment of these categories of disorders. Brodalumab, a human antiIL-17RA monoclonal antibody, has shown efficacy in psoriasis, a
similar autoimmune skin disease.’° It binds with high affinity to
human IL-17RA and blocks the biological activity of interleukins
17 family.

IL17RA gene is highly polymorphic (www.ensemble.org). Several
common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this gene have
been linked to increased susceptibility for developing cancer, autoimmune diseases, and inflammatory conditions.2°! Genetic variants
can alter protein expression, processing, maturation, and activity in
human disorders.2? One common variant of IL17RA existed upstream
in the gene (c.-947G>A) is rs4819554 SNP. Being within the promoter region and closely related to the binding site of transcription
factors as Ikaros (IK) family, which is related to Th17 cell differentiation,2? we proposed the possibility to have a functional consequence on the transcription rate of the gene. This SNP was reported
to be associated with autoimmune diseases and cancer.’* Another
common missense variant rs879577 is caused by a C to T substitution (c.1100C>T) in exon 13 leading to an amino acid change from

alanine to valine at codon 367. This SNP overlaps three transcripts
of IL-17RA protein. Thus, being in the protein coding sequence might
have altered function.

The role of IL-17RA gene polymorphism in the pathogenesis of
CSU has not been studied yet; therefore, we hypothesized that IL17RA gene polymorphism may be associated with CSU like other autoimmune diseases. The aim of the present study was to determine
the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs4819554 and
rs879577) of IL-17RA gene with CSU susceptibility and severity.

2 | METHODOLOGY
2.1 | Study population

Seventy CSU patients (29 males and 41 females) were enrolled in the
study. They were recruited from the Dermatology Clinic, Faculty of
Medicine at Suez Canal University Hospitals, in the period between
November 2014 and April 2015. The control group comprised 30
sex-, and age- matched healthy subjects with negative ASST results.
Ethical approval by the Regional Ethics Committee of the Faculty of
Medicine, Suez Canal University Hospital was obtained (#2747). All
patients and control subjects gave their written informed consent

before enrolling in the study.

2.2 | Clinical assessment

Demographic and clinical data including age at onset, disease duration, nail involvement, familial history of CSU, and other comorbidities apart of CSU were collected. Early onset was considered if the
age of CSU onset was below or equal to 40 years. Familial CSU was
considered positive if there was at least one first- or second-degree
affected relative. All patients underwent thorough general examination as well as dermatological examination of CSU lesions. These
included a skin prick test for food and inhalant allergens and provocation tests for physical urticaria (an ice test for cold urticaria or skin
scratching for dermographism).

Urticaria activity score (UAS) was applied for disease severity assessment. It was calculated as recommended by the EAACI/GA2LEN/
EDF/WAO Guidelines.“ The weekly UAS was estimated according
to the number of wheals and pruritus intensity, which appeared
during the week before the day of blood sampling. The patients were
asked to record 24-hour self-evaluation scores for 7 days, using the
following scoring scheme: no wheals = 0; <20 wheals/24 hours = 1;
20-50 wheals/24 hours = 2; and > 50 wheals/24 hours = 3; and
pruritus intensity: no = 0; mild = 1; moderate = 2; and severe = 3.
The weekly UAS was equal to the sum of the scores obtained on 7
consecutive days, with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score
of 42. Consequently, this score was graded as follows: 0-14 (mild),
15-29 (moderate), or 30-42 (severe).

Urticaria Patient Daily Diary (UPDD) was also applied. The validated UPDD contains the UAS data (assessed every 12 hours) and
NADA Er AL.

 

daily activity interference, sleep interference, and presence of angioedema, all of which are assessed every 24 hours, as well as the
use of rescue medication.?°

The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) was applied to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The DLQI has a total
score that ranges from O to 30, with higher scores reflecting
worse HRQoL. The recall period for the DLQI is 1 week. DLQI
data were collected at baseline and weeks 4, 12, 24, 30. Validated
score ranges exist for the DLQI to explain the impact on dermatological-related QoL: no effect (0-1); small effect (2-5); moderate effect (6-10); very large effect (11-20); extremely large effect
(21-30).2628

Autologous serum skin test (ASST) was performed to detect
basophil histamine-releasing activity and to diagnose chronic autoimmune urticaria (CAU) among CSU patients. Sedating antihistamines were stopped at 7 days, and non-sedating antihistamines
were stopped at 3 days before blood samples were collected. 10 cc
of venous blood was obtained from the patients into sterile plain
tubes and left to coagulate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
The blood was then centrifuged for 15 minutes at 500 g, and the
serum was eluted. 50 pL of the serum was drawn into an insulin injector and injected into the volar face of the forearm intradermally.
Ten microliters of histamine (Allergopharma) as a positive control
and 50 pL of physiological saline solution as a negative control (for
the intracutaneous test; Allergopharma) were injected intradermal
at 5 cm from the area that received the autologous serum injection.
After 30 minutes, erythema and in-duration were evaluated. The
widest diameter of in-duration and the diameter that was perpendicular to this diameter were measured. Erythema and in-duration
were graded as recommended by the EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF/WAO
Guidelines?’ as follows: Grade 0: skin rash caused by physiological
saline solution that is expected to be light pink or skin-colored.
Grade 1: The formation of pink color caused by autologous serum,
whereas the area where physiological saline solution was injected
remains skin-colored. Grade 2: The formation of a histamine-like
red color caused by autologous serum, whereas the area where
physiological saline solution was injected remains skin-colored. A
positive test reaction was indicated when the erythema caused by
the autologous serum was grade 2 and the diameter of in-duration was 1.5 mm greater than that of the in-duration caused by
the physiological saline solution. The same researcher performed
all ASST.

The control group underwent the same laboratory and dermatological tests as the patients to exclude any inflammatory or autoim
mune diseases.

2.3 | Biochemical analysis

Liver function tests, complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, a parasite stool test, and complete urine analysis
were performed in the clinical pathology department laboratories,

Suez Canal University Hospital.

 

2.4 | Allelic discrimination analysis by real-time PCR

Two milliliters of whole blood was obtained from controls and patients in EDTA vacutainers (Becton Dickinson Plymouth), and stored
at -60°C until processed for DNA extraction. DNA extraction from
blood leukocytes was done using QlAamp DNA Blood Mini kits
(Q\Agen, Clinilab Co., Catalog no. 51104), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Concentration and purity of the extracted DNA
of each sample were measured by NanoDrop ND-1000 (NanoDrop
Tech., Inc). Genotyping of the promoter variant (rs4819554, c.947G>A) and the missense mutation of rs879577 SNP at codon
367 (c.1100C>T; p.A367E or p.367V) was performed using real-time
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technology, using TaqMan®
genotyping assay (Applied Biosystem, assay ID C__337392_30 and
C__2666446 20) to detect the presence of one or both alleles in
each sample. TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (2x) and 20x SNP
Genotyping Assay were used in a total PCR reaction volume of 20
uL. Two no-template controls (NTC) were included in each run. Initial
step of 95°C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 92°C for 15 seconds and annealing/extension step at 60°C
for 1 minute. SDS (Software-Defined Storage) Software v1.4 was
used for allelic discrimination analysis. For the promotor variant
rs4819554, possible genotypes were GG, AA, and GA. The probe
for allele G was labeled with VIC® dye; the probe for allele A was
labeled with FAM™ dye. Regarding Ala367Glu polymorphism, possible genotypes were CC, CT, and TT. The probe for allele C (Alanine)
was labeled with VIC® dye; the probe for allele T (Glutamic acid) was
labeled with FAM™ dye.

2.5 | Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was carried out using the “Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for windows” software, version 26.0.
The test for normality was performed using the Shapiro-Wilk test.
Descriptive statistics were represented as mean + standard deviation (SD) for quantitative variables and percentage for qualitative
variables. For qualitative variables, the Chi-square (2) and Fisher's
Exact tests were used. For quantitative variables, the student's t and
Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for non-parametric variables. A Pvalue < .05 was considered statistically significant, and all statistical
tests were two-sided.

The genotype frequency within each group was calculated as
the number of genotypes divided by the total number of the group.
The allele frequency was determined as the number of occurrences
of an individual allele divided by the total number of alleles.°° The
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) for each SNP was tested by
using a goodness-of-fit Chi-square test via the Online Encyclopedia
for Genetic Epidemiology (OEGE) software (http://www.oege.org/
software/hwe-mr-calc.html).

The associations of the IL-17RA rs4819554 and rs879577 genotypes and susceptibility to urticaria disease were estimated by computing odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (Cls) from
NADA er AL.

binary logistic regression analysis (Enter method) after adjustment for
possible confounders. The pooled ORs were calculated for the five genetic association models; for rs4819554 variant: allelic model (G vs A),
homozygote comparison (GG vs AA), heterozygote comparison (AG
vs AA), dominant model (AA + GA vs GG), and recessive model (GG
vs AG + AA), while for rs879577: allelic model (T vs C), homozygote
comparison (TT vs CC), heterozygote comparison (CT vs CC), dominant model (TT + CT vs CC), and recessive model (TT vs CT + CC).22
Linkage disequilibrium statistics and haplotype frequency estimation
were performed in SNPStats software (https://www.snpstats.net/).
Data exploration by multivariate analysis (MVA) was performed
using Bray-Curtis Ordination analysis and Two-way hierarchical
cluster analysis to identify similarities and dissimilarities between
urticaria patients based on their characteristics and genotypes. PCORD version 5.0 software was employed for analysis. The following
setup for 70 strands and 17 factors was adjusted for MVA: Distance
method: Sorensen, Endpoint selection method: Variance-regression,
group linkage method: Flexible beta (0.75), and clustering factor:
relative by factor maximum, axis projection geometry: Euclidean,
calculation of residual distance: Euclidean, and calculated scores for

factor by weighted averaging.

3 | RESULTS

3.1 | Baseline characteristics of the study
population

The demographic and baseline characteristics of the study population are demonstrated in Table 1. A total of 70 patients, including 41
(58.6%) females and 29 (41.4%) males, participated in the study. They
were diagnosed with CSU and were being treated at the Internal
Diseases Allergy Immunology Clinic. The mean age of the patients
was 28.2 + 11.9 years (age range between 14 and 56). Thirty-five

patients had positive ASST results, and 35 had negative results.
Among patients, only three (4.3%) had a family history of CSU while
67 (95.7%) did not have positive family history. The majority (53.4 of
CSU, 74.3%) were employed. On the other hand, the control group
(30 individuals) included 13 (43.3%) males and 17 (56.7%) females
with a mean age of 32.3 + 12.3 years (age range of between 13 and
63). All control subjects had negative ASST results. No significance
differences were observed between cases and control regarding
their age, sex, or family history. However, there were statistical significance differences between them in occupation condition with

increased frequency of employment in the patient group (P = .048).

3.2 | Disease characteristics of urticaria patients

Mean disease duration of patients was 8.71 + 1.37 weeks. Thirtyfour patients (48.6%) experienced urticaria disease for less than or
equal 8 weeks, 31 patients (44.3%) had lesions for less than or equal
10 weeks, while 5 patients (7.1%) showed further prolonged features for <12 weeks. Regarding disease course, almost all patients
had recurrent disease. Lesions were mostly distributed in the abdomen and arms. Less than quarter the patients had concomitant angioedema, Figure 1. Assessment of patients via angioedema activity
score (AAS) was employed to estimate the level of five key factors
related to angioedema symptoms. All CSU patients with angioedema
had a total daily score more than 8. According to the ASST, thirtyfive (50%) patients had positive ASST results, while the other half
had negative results. Regarding patients' treatment, 60% of CSU patients were treated with Step 1 medications including non-sedating
second-generation antihistamines, while 40% of patients received
Step 2 medications with doses up to four times those recommended
on the label of non-sedating, second-generation antihistamines. The
second-generation antihistamines provided moderate-to-good control for 50% of patients with CSU.

Disease severity was assessed using urticaria activity score
(UAS) system, Table 2. Half patients, accounting for 45.7%, had
moderate number of wheals ranging from 11 to 50, while about a
quarter (25.7%) exhibited large number of wheals. Moreover, 20%
of patients displayed wheals with >3 cm in size. Three quarters of
CSU cases experienced moderate-to-severe itching. In addition, urticaria lesions of more than half of patients (55.7%) disappeared by
12 hours.

Stratifies analysis by gender revealed non-significant difference
in all UAS symptoms between males and females, Table 2. However,
stratification by angioedema and ASST demonstrated that patients
with angioedema [16 (22.8%)] had more wheals (P < .001), a wider
distribution (P < .001), higher wheal score (P < .001), intense itching (P < .001), and more prolonged duration (P < .001) than patients
without angioedema, Figure 2A-E. Similar findings were encountered in patients with positive ASST, Figure 2F-J.

3.3 | Molecular analysis of IL17RA gene
polymorphism

A total of 70 patients and 30 controls were genotyped. The distribution of IL17RA genotype among patients and controls was found in
accordance with those expected by the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
(P > .05). SNP analysis of the promoter variant rs4819554 (c.-947G>A)
showed that the frequencies of G and A alleles in controls were 0.47
and 0.53, respectively. As depicted in Table 4, comparing between urticaria patients and controls, GG was significantly the most prevalent
genotype among patients (42.9% in patients vs 16.7% in controls), while

FIGURE 2 Stratification analysis. Stratification of urticaria activity score (UAS) by angioedema and autologous serum skin test in patient

group (n = 70)

GA genotype was predominant in the healthy control group (38.6% in
patients vs 60% in controls), P = .039. Consistently, the frequency of A
allele was significantly lower in urticaria patients compared to controls
(37.1% vs 53.3%; P = .042). Carriers for A variants were less likely to develop urticaria than their counterpart under homozygote comparison
(OR=0.18, 95% Cl = 0.03-0.89), heterozygote comparison (OR = 0.24,
95% Cl = 0.06-0.91), dominant model (OR = 0.24, 95% Cl = 0.06-0.91),
and allelic model (OR = 0.40, 95% Cl = 0.66-0.91).

In contrast, SNP analysis of rs879577 (c.1100C>T) showed that

the frequencies of C and T alleles in the whole study population

were 0.53 and 0.47, respectively. On comparing between urticaria
patients and controls, CC was significantly the most prevalent genotype among patients (34.3% in patients vs 13.3% in controls), while
TT genotype was predominant in the healthy control group (18.6% in
patients vs 33.3% in controls) (P = .022). Consistently, the frequency
of T allele was significantly lower in urticaria patients compared to
controls (42.9% vs 60.0%; P = .020). Carriers for T variants were less
likely to develop urticaria than their counterparts under homozygote, dominant model, and allelic model, but after adjustment results

were insignificant, Table 4.

3.4 | Haplotype analysis

Though there was poor linkage equilibrium between the two variants (r = 0.007, P = .92), patients with genotype combination of
rs4819554*A and rs879577*T conferred protection against developing CSU, Table 5.

3.5 | Association between IL17RA genotypes and
features of CSU patients

On comparison between CSU patients with different IL17RA
rs4819554 genotypes (GG, GA, and AA), there was no significance
association between genotypes of rs481995 promoter variant and
age, sex, family history, or occupation. Though rs4819554*G variant was showed earlier to be the risky allele in CSU, the other allele
(rs4819554*A) displayed more severe features. A/A genotype was associated with more prolonged disease duration (P = .044), concurrent
angioedema (P < .001), and positive ASST status (P < .001). A/A genotype also demonstrated more frequent lesions in abdomen (P = .049)
and legs (P = .042). In addition, the same variant was associated with
higher level of treatment step (P < .001). CSU patients carrying A/A
genotype were associated with the worst score in each UAS domain.
A/A patients displayed a greater number of wheals (>50) (P < .001),
higher prevalence of wheals > 3 cm (P < .001), greater score of wheals
(P < .001), more intense itching (P < .001), and prolonged persistence
of wheals > 12 hours (P = .004). In addition, A/A genotype was associated with higher scores for quality of life assessment (P < .001).
Regarding IL17RA rs879577 genotypes (CC, CT, and TT), CC genotype
was associated with CSU lesions in legs (P = .002) and concurrent angioedema (P < .001). Patients with the same genotype also reported
poor symptoms in all QoL parameters (P < .001), Table 6.

3.6 | Multivariate analysis of clinical data

Principal component analysis of CSU patients using molecular and

clinical variables scattered patients in a high dimensional space.

 

Classifying patients according to their IL17RA promoter genotype at
rs4819554 (c.-947G>A) polymorphism is demonstrated in Figure 3.
Ordination revealed that, a part of one patient, clear demarcation of
CSU patients with A/A genotype was observed. Clustering of this
group was highly influenced by prolonged disease duration, concomitant angioedema, in addition to higher AAS, UAS, and QoL scores in
these patients, thus, supporting the results of the univariate analysis

in the previous tables.

4 | DISCUSSION

The present study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to investigate a potential influence of IL-17RA in urticaria patients. Here, we
tried to shed light on the role of analyzing IL-17RA gene polymorphism as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for CSU phenotype.
Genotype profiling of IL17RA rs4819554 (G/A) and rs879577(C/T)
variants was carried out in a sample of an Egyptian population. Our
results demonstrated rs4819554*G allele to be a putative marker for
disease risk while rs4819554*an allele was associated with severe
phenotype. On the other hand, rs879577*C was associated with
angioedema.

In our study population, genotypes of patients and controls of
rs4819554 SNP were in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Allelic discrimination detected G and A alleles with frequencies
of 0.47 and 0.53 in the control group. In this SNP, the minor allele
(G) is reported to be 0.01 in Africans, 0.41 in Americans, 0.42 in East
Asians, 0.24 in South Asians, and 0.21 in Europe (www.ensemble.org).
On comparison between the study groups, GG was the most frequent
genotype among CSU patients, while GA genotype was more prevalent in controls. Additionally, rs4819554*G variant was the risky allele
under heterozygote and homozygote comparisons a well as dominant
and allelic models. In agreement with our results, [L17RA rs4819554
variant was related to susceptibility to psoriasis in Spanish patients.
G carriers were more predominant among patients.°? In contrast, this
promoter variant did not show significant association with alopecia
areata risk in a Korean population.°? Nevertheless, rs4819554*A allele was more frequent in patients with papillary thyroid cancer than
in control patients °4 and was associated with increased risk of developing end-stage renal disease.°° At the rs4819554 site in the IL17RA
gene, the genomic sequence with G allele displayed an SP1 transcription factor consensus sequence; however, this consensus sequence
was absent in the sequence with A variant.°*

Another main finding in our results, patients carrying
rs4819554*AA genotype, was associated with more prolonged disease duration, concomitant angioedema, and positive ASST status,
advanced stage in treatment, and worst quality of life score in CSU.
Similarly, homozygosity of AA was associated with more deterioration of renal function®? and higher primary graft dysfunction.°6 A
allele of IL17RA gene also showed significant difference between the
early onset AA and late onset AA in a Korean population.°? After
analyzing several SNPs in coding and regulatory regions in two

Spanish cohorts with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), results indicated

the genetic role of our promoter variant in the development of severe forms of AS.”* Interestingly, rs4819554* A allele was linked to
an increased expression of the IL-17RA protein and higher levels of
Th17 cell subsets,°° which might explain the increased severity of
immune-related diseases.

The missense mutation rs879577 (c.1100C>T) showed allele
frequencies of 0.53 and 0.47 for C and T alleles in the whole study
population. In population genetics projects as the 1000 Genome
Project Phase 3, similar frequencies (53% and 47% respectively)

were reported. In contrast, minor allele frequencies (T allele)

accounted for 9%, 26%, and 28% in Asia, Europe, and America
respectively (www.ensembl.org). CC genotype was significantly
the most prevalent among patients, while TT genotype was predominant in the healthy control group. Similarly, the frequency of
T allele was significantly lower in urticaria patients compared to
controls. Haplotype analysis showed that patients with genotype
combination of rs4819554*A and rs879577*T conferred protection against developing CSU. Carriers of rs879577*C allele, which
was the predominant variant in CSU patients, were also associated

with poor clinical markers in CSU. CC genotype was associated

with concurrent angioedema, lesions in legs, and low quality of life
domains. A putative explanation for this is depicted in the following structural analysis of the point mutation; in the cytoplasmic
domain of IL-17Ra protein, the nucleotide substitution from cytosine to thymine at the position 22:17 108 319 causes a missense
mutation at codon 367; changing from alanine to valine (p.A367V)
with the same preserved length of the protein. This amino acid
change is located between two beta strands (297-301 and 379383), away from active or binding sites, and is predicted by computational tools as SIFT and PolyPhen to be tolerable mutation.
However, amino acid composition analysis of alanine along with its
substituted residues demonstrated that alanine is unique in that
it is the only amino acid where the side chain is connected to the
protein backbone twice, forming a five-membered ring; therefore,
it cannot adopt a normal helical conformation and is usually found

in very tight turns and on the surface of protein structures. On

the other hands, the hydrophobic, bulky, and branched valine (V)
residue tends to lie near the protein backbone, within beta sheets
and to be buried in protein hydrophobic cores. Thus, structural alterations in the IL-17Ra protein from alanine to valine might cause
conformational changes with functional consequences.

The pathogenesis of CSU is probably characterized by a
multiplicity of mechanisms, including autoimmunity, autoallergy, and coagulation, each of which may carry different
weight in each patient. We have demonstrated for the first time
that IL17RA polymorphisms have the possibilities of determining
the pathophysiology of CSU phenotype. Our data supported the
biological role of the IL-17RA gene in the development and progression of CSU disease. The promoter variant could be a putative marker for disease risk and severity in a sample of Egyptian
population. However, some limitations warrant to be mentioned.

First, small sample size was enrolled in the study, and replication

in larger cohorts is warranted to confirm the genetic association of
rs4819554 and rs879577 to CSU and study the functional impact
of the variant on disease progression. Second, in the survey/questionnaire format and subjectivity of data might impose a putative
bias effect. In addition, adding another positive control group with
an inflammatory dermatosis condition would enhance the study.
Functional consequence of the polymorphism was not studied in
the laboratory, and correlation analysis between the expression
level of IL-17RA and polymorphism in blood of CSU patients would
have added more value on the study outcomes.

In conclusion, we combined clinical and molecular analysis to illustrate the influence of the promoter polymorphism (rs4819554) and
missense mutation (rs879577) on CSU development and progression.
We found individuals with rs4819554*GG homozygosity were associated with disease risk, while those with rs4819554*AA genotype
displayed more severe phenotype, while rs879577*CC was associated
with angioedema. Whether it directly contributes to disease susceptibility or in linkage disequilibrium with other true-causing polymorphisms needs further investigation. Screening CSU patients for
IL17RA genetic determinants during patient's assessment would predict the course of the disease and guide the best medication choice in
each patient, which may ultimately enhance care and improve health

outcomes.
