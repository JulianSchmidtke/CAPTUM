Abstract

Background: Chronic urticaria (CU) appears to be of autoimmune origin in about half of all patients, since several autoreactive immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs), such as anti-FceRla and
anti-IgE, are detected in the sera of such patients. However,
whether autoreactive IgE is associated with CU remains unclear. In this study, we attempted to identify autoreactive IgE
antibodies in sera from patients with CU. Methods: Sera
were collected from 67 normal subjects, 85 patients with CU
and 28 patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). An autologous
serum skin test (ASST) was performed on 27 of the CU patients. Autoreactive IgE and IgG levels against self-antigens
were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The basophils were activated with dsDNA, and the
CD63 expression level was examined using a fluorescenceactivated cell sorter. Results: The anti-dsDNA IgE levels were
significantly higher in patients with CU and AD than in normal subjects, but no differences in the anti-dsDNA IgG levels
were seen. The levels of thioredoxin-, peroxiredoxin- and

thyroglobulin-reactive IgE and IgG were not significantly
higher in the CU patients than in the other 2 groups. There
was no significant difference in the levels of anti-dsDNA IgE
between ASST-positive and ASST-negative patients. The basophils from 2 out of 9 CU patients exhibited degranulation
in response to dsDNA. Conclusions: Our data suggest that
anti-dsDNA IgE is involved in the pathogenesis of some cas
es of CU. Copyright © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel

Introduction

Chronic urticaria (CU) is characterized by the occurrence of the spontaneous emergence of wheals and a flare
reaction lasting for more than 6 weeks. Mast cell (MC)
activation is believed to be involved in the pathogenesis
of CU, since the tryptase level in sera from patients with
CU is significantly higher than that in sera from patients
with atopic dermatitis (AD) and normal subjects [1]. Recently, several studies have demonstrated that omalizu
Y.H. and J.K. contributed equally to this work.

mab is useful for the treatment of CU patients [2, 3], suggesting that immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated MC activation is crucial to the development of this disorder.

The in vivo autologous serum skin test (ASST) is the
diagnostic gold standard for the detection of autoantibodies against FceRI or IgE itself, as well as other autoreactive serum components [4]. Approximately 40-45% of
CU patients reportedly produce autoreactive IgG antibodies, such as anti-FceRIa and anti-IgE [5-7]. Purified
anti-FceRIa and anti-IgE antibodies from patients with
CU are capable of inducing histamine release from basophils [8]. So in a subpopulation of patients, CU appears
to be of autoimmune origin. A broad spectrum of IgEbinding self-antigens is reportedly associated with atopic
eczema. In CU patients, a significant increase in the serum level of one autoreactive IgE, anti-thyroid peroxidase
IgE, has been reported, compared to the level in normal
subjects [9]. However, whether other autoreactive IgEs
are increased in CU patients and whether autoreactive
IgE is associated with the symptoms of CU remain unknown. In this study, we attempted to identify which autoreactive IgE antibodies in sera from patients with CU
are involved in the pathogenesis of CU.

Materials and Methods

Sera from Normal Subjects, CU Patients and AD Patients

Human peripheral blood samples were obtained from normal
subjects, CU patients and AD patients. Written informed consent
was obtained from all participants and the study was approved by
the Ethics Committee of the Nihon University School of Medicine.
All studies involving human subjects were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki.

Reagents and Antibodies

The following reagents were purchased from the indicated
sources: double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) from calf thymus, thioredoxin, peroxiredoxin, thyroglobulin and calcium ionophore
A23187 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., USA); PE-conjugated anti-CD63 (clone H5C6) and biotinylated anti-human IgE and IgG
mAbs (BD Biosciences, San Diego, Calif., USA); streptavidin- HRP
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn., USA); PE/Cy5-streptavidin
(Biolegend, San Diego, Calif., USA); and purified or biotin-conjugated anti-FceRla mAb (clone CRA1; eBioscience, San Diego,
Calif., USA).

Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays for the Detection of

Autoreactive Antibodies

dsDNA, thioredoxin, peroxiredoxin and thyroglobulin (5 ug/
ml) were coated in 96-well plates and left overnight at room temperature. After the wells were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS, sera
from normal subjects, CU patients and AD patients (diluted 1:10
and 1:100 for the detection of autoreactive IgE and IgG, respec

tively) were added. Bound human IgE and IgG were detected using
biotinylated anti-human IgE and IgG monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs), followed by streptavidin-HRP. The color was developed,
and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured.

Autologous Serum Skin Test

An ASST was performed according to an internationally approved protocol [10]. Briefly, 0.2 ml of autologous serum was injected intradermally (undiluted) into the volar aspect of both forearms. Histamine and normal saline were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The results were evaluated at 30 min
after injection and were considered positive if the wheal diameter
exceeded the injection wheal by 1.5 mm and was accompanied by
a flare reaction.

Activation of Basophils

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from fresh
heparinized peripheral blood using density gradient centrifugation and were resuspended in assay medium (HEPES buffer,
1 mM CaCh, 1 mM MgCl and 0.025% BSA) to a final concentration of 10° cells/ml. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells were
incubated with IL-3 (10 ng/ml; PeproTech EC Ltd., London, UK)
for 30 min [11] and washed, then stimulated with dsDNA (1, or 10
ug/ml), rabbit anti-IgE Ab (0.1 g/ml; DAKO Cytomation, Carpinteria, Calif., USA), or calcium ionophore A23187 (10-6 M) at
37°C for 30 min. A flow cytometric analysis of the mononuclear
cells was performed as described previously [12]. Biotin-conjugated anti-FceRIa mAb (clone CRA1) and PE-conjugated anti-CD63
(clone H5C6) were used. PE/Cy5-streptavidin was used as a secondary antibody.

 

 

Statistical Analysis

Differences among the 3 groups of data were analyzed using
nonparametric Steel-Dwass analysis and were considered significant at p < 0.05.

Results

Table 1 shows the characteristics of the study subjects.
The CU patients, AD patients and normal control group
were comprised of 85 subjects with a median and interquartile age range of 44.5 + 15.7 years, 28 with a median
and interquartile age range of 41.9 + 15.5 years and 67
with a median and interquartile age range of 34.6 + 8.7
years, respectively. The durations of the disease in the CU
and AD patients were 46.3 + 59.6 and 317.4 + 140.2
months, respectively (median and interquartile range),
and their total IgE levels were 307 + 318 and 4,646 + 4,267
IU/ml, respectively (median and interquartile range).
Ten (40%) CU patients had positive ASST results and 15
(60%) had negative ASST results.

To investigate which autoreactive IgE levels were increased, we measured the dsDNA-, thioredoxin-, peroxiredoxin-, and thyroglobulin-reactive IgE and IgG levels
in the serum samples. In figure 1a, the anti-dsDNA IgE

levels in the patients with CU and the patients with AD
were significantly higher than that of the normal subjects. However, the anti-dsDNA IgG level in the CU patients was not significantly different from that in the AD
patients and the normal subjects (fig. 1b). We observed
no significant increases in the levels of thioredoxin-,
peroxiredoxin- and thyroglobulin-reactive IgE and IgG
in sera from the CU patients, compared to the levels in
sera from AD patients and normal subjects (data not
shown).

To evaluate the correlation between the levels of antidsDNA IgE and the laboratory data, we compared the
levels with the total IgE concentration, duration of the
disease, sex of the subjects and the ASST results. No cor
relation was observed between the levels of anti-dsDNA
IgE and the total IgE levels (y = 1.2 x 10° ~ 312) + 0363,
r’ = 0.00073), the duration of the disease (y = 9.0 x
1075 (*~51) + 0.352, +2 — 9.0016) and the sex (0.35 + 0.02 vs.
0.35 + 0.02, p = 0.87) of the CU patients. There was no
significant difference in the levels of anti-dsDNA IgE between ASST-positive and ASST-negative patients (fig. 2).

The ability of dsDNA to form cross links with receptor-bound anti-dsDNA IgE on the surface of basophils
was analyzed by evaluating the upregulation of CD63 on
FceRI*-gated cells using a fluorescence-activated cell
sorter (fig. 3). The dsDNA was able to induce CD63 upregulation on basophils from 2 out of 9 patients with CU
who tested positive for anti-dsDNA IgE but not from nor

mal subjects, suggesting that dsDNA is able to aggregate
FceRI, leading to the activation of basophils from patients
with CU who tested positive for anti-dsDNA IgE.

Discussion

In this study, we observed that the anti-dsDNA IgE
evels were significantly increased in patients with CU
(fig. 1), but the thioredoxin-, peroxiredoxin- and thyroglobulin-reactive IgE levels were not. There was no significant difference in the levels of anti-dsDNA IgE beween ASST-positive and ASST-negative patients (fig. 2).
The total IgE levels, the duration of the disease period
and sex of the patients were not correlated with the antidsDNA IgE levels. dsDNA was able to induce the upreguation of CD63 expression on basophils from 2 out of 9
patients with CU who were anti-dsDNA IgE positive, but
not on basophils from all normal subjects (n = 3) (fig. 3).
These data suggest that anti-dsDNA IgE may exacerbate
wheals and flares in some cases of CU.

The sera from ASST-negative CU patients are believed
‘0 not contain molecules that induce the aggregation of
FceRI, such as anti-IgE or anti-FceRla chain. Our data
indicated that there was no significant relationship beween serum levels of anti-dsDNA IgE and autoantibodies against FceRI or IgE itself, which induce the aggregaion of FceRI. The dsDNA (1 and 10 ug/ml) was directly
able to activate basophils from 2 out of 9 CU patients with
anti-dsDNA IgE, indicating that anti-dsDNA IgE bound
‘0 the FceRI of patients’ basophils. The concentrations of
dsDNA (1 and 10 ug/ml) used in the study are experimenally used for stimulation of immune cells and other cells
as a danger signal. A higher concentration (10 ug/ml) of
dsDNA was less effective for degranulation than 1 ug/ml
of dsDNA. It has been reported that degranulation of
bone marrow-derived mast cells was significantly reduced at supraoptimal antigen levels due to SHIP activation [13]. We have not performed the experiments using
basophils from AD patients in this study set. As we also
observed that the anti-dsDNA IgE levels were significantly increased in patients with AD, there is a possibility that
dsDNA may be directly able to activate basophils from
some of AD patients with anti-dsDNA IgE. Our present
data suggest that autoreactive IgE-mediated MC activation may be critical to the development of disease in some
cases of CU.

In summary, we detected significantly higher levels of
anti-dsDNA IgE in patients with CU than in normal subjects. dsDNA directly activated basophils from CU patients with a high level of anti-dsDNA IgE, suggesting that
anti-dsDNA IgE might be involved in the pathogenesis of
CU in some cases.
