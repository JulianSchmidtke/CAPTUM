ABSTRACT

Purpose: This study aimed to systemically review literature relating to factors that could
potentially predict a favorable response to cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment for chronic
spontaneous urticaria (CSU).

Methods: A systematic literature review was done according to Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis recommendations.

Results: A total of 13 studies (404 patients with CSU and 200 healthy patients) were included.
There were only 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT) and 12 non-RCTs. Our systematic review
showed that positive autologous serum skin test results, positive baseline basophil histamine
release assays, positive baseline basophil activation test responses, elevated baseline plasma
D-dimer levels, elevated baseline serum interleukin (IL)-2, IL-5, and tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNF-a) levels, and low baseline serum IgE levels might assist in predicting favorable CsA
responses in CSU patients. Decreased plasma D-dimer levels; and decreased serum IL-2, IL-5,
and TNF-« levels were reported to be correlated with clinical improvement after CsA treatment.
Conclusions: Since most positive results were from non-RCT articles and some data were still
inconsistent, this systematic review identified no reliable practical biomarker for predicting
CsA treatment response in patients with CSU. There were no positive predictors with good
consistency and mechanical plausibility.

Keywords: Urticaria; cyclosporine; treatment outcome

INTRODUCTION

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is defined as the occurrence of spontaneous wheals,
angioedema, or both for more than 6 weeks.! The EAACI/GA*LEN/EDE/WAO guidelines
recommend modern, second-generation, H;-antihistamines as the first-line therapy. If

the symptoms are inadequately controlled after 2-4 weeks, up-dosing second-generation
Hrantihistamines up to 4-fold is recommended.’ For antihistamine-unresponsive CSU,
omalizumab and cyclosporine A (CsA) are recommended as add-on therapy. However, CsA is
an off-label use for urticaria.

CsA, a potent immunosuppressive drug, inhibits Ty; cells by blocking the production of

 

inflammatory cytokines. The complex between CsA and cyclophilin inhibits the phosphatase
activity of calcineurin, which down-regulates the transcription of cytokine genes (interleukin
[IL]-2, IL-2; IL-3; IL-4; and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-a]).? In vitro studies showed
that pre-incubating leukocytes with CsA inhibited histamine release after stimulation

with sera from CSU patients.’ CsA has been shown to reduce histamine, leukotriene, and
prostaglandin release by mast cells and basophils both in vitro and in vivo.* Harrison et

al.’ showed that CsA inhibited the IgE-mediated histamine release from mast cells bya
concentration dependent effect. Grattan et al.° reported a reduction in serum histaminereleasing activity and the autologous serum skin test (ASST) response after CsA treatment.
Also, CsA reportedly reduces serum levels of IL-2R, IL-5, and TNF-a.’ These findings support
the hypothesis that the mechanisms of CsA in CSU may involve effects on activated T cells,
basophils, mast cells, and perhaps other cells.

A meta-analysis study showed overall response rates of CSU to CsA treatment of 54%,

66%, and 73% at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, respectively.’ There are increasing reports of potential
factors of CsA treatment response. The study of reliable factors could lead to a personalized
approach and would serve as an objective follow-up for patients. We then performed a
systematic review to identify factors which may potentially predict a favorable response to
CsA treatment for CSU.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The systematic literature review was done according to the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis recommendations.’

Search strategy and eligibility criteria

A literature search of electronic databases (PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, EMBASE, and
The Cochrane Library) was performed using the term “chronic spontaneous (or idiopathic)
urticaria and ciclosporin (or cyclosporine or cyclosporin).” Then all articles that related to
factors predicting the response to CsA treatment in patients with CSU were later selected.
CsA either the microemulsion formulation (Neoral, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland and generic
euivalents) or the original formulation (Sandimmun, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland and
generic euivalent) was included in this study. The eligibility criteria for included reports were:
i) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs; ii) CSU patients treated with CsA;

and iii) any reported factors that were or were not significantly associated with a response

to CsA treatment. In vitro studies, review articles, case reports, case series, comments, and
replies were excluded. Non-English articles and non-full-text publications were excluded. The
remaining articles were initially screened by 2 independent reviewers (K.K. and C.S.), who
subsequently obtained full texts and reviewed them for eligibility. Thirteen relevant articles
were systematically reviewed (Figure).

Data extraction and bias assessments

The data extraction was independently conducted by 2 reviewers. The following characteristics
were identified in each study: i) the first author's name and the publication year; ii) study
design; iii) number of CsA-treated patients and controls; iv) number of studied patients; v)
CsA dose and treatment duration; vi) severity and treatment-response assessment; and vii)

predicting factors for a CsA response. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus discussion
between the authors. In the case of RCTs, the quality and risk of bias were assessed using
Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias,'° and for non-RCTs, the
Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (Supplementary Table $1). The studies
identified as being relevant to a CsA response in CSU were assessed for their evidence levels
using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system.”

RESULTS

Literature search results

A total of 13 studies (404 patients with CSU and 200 healthy patients) met the eligibility
criteria and were included in our systematic review (Figure).°”'* There were 1 RCT°; 8
open-labelled, prospective studies?3">7'80!3; and 3 retrospective studies.*"°? One study
was an RCT at first, but was subsequently switched to an open-labelled, prospective study
because of control failures.” The quality and risk of bias of the studies included were shown
in Supplementary Table $1.

Potential factors for response to CsA treatment

We classified factors into 5 categories: clinical factors, histamine-releasing factors,
coagulation and inflammatory factors, autoantibodies, and cytokines. Because 1 study might
report more than 1 outcome, so each study might be shown in more than 1 table.

Clinical factors (Supplementary Table S2, Table 1)

1) History of urticaria

Hollander et al."° performed a retrospective study of 62 CSU patients receiving 1 mg/kg/day
of CsA every 2 to 4 weeks. They concluded that prior histories of acute or chronic urticaria
predicted favorable responses to CsA (P= 0.010).

2) Disease severity

Three articles (2 open-labelled, prospective studies; 1 retrospective study) examined
associations between baseline disease severity and clinical response to CsA. Asero” performed
an open-label, prospective study in 29 severe antihistamine-resistant CSU patients. The author
reported no relationship between baseline disease severity assessed by the urticaria activity
score (UAS) and clinical CsA responses (P= 0.906). These results are also supported by studies
of Santiago et al.” and Endo et al.”*

3) Disease duration

Four studies (2 open-labelled, prospective studies; 2 retrospective studies) were identified.
Asero" reported that the baseline duration of urticaria in 29 CSU patients, receiving 4 mg/
kg/day of CsA, was not associated with clinical responses to CsA (P= 0.252). This study has
been supported by the studies of Santiago et al.” and Endo et al.” In contrast, Hollander et al."°
studied 68 patients with CSU receiving 1 mg/kg/day of CsA. The average duration of the current
episodes of urticaria was 100 weeks. The mean duration of urticaria in the complete responders
and partial/non-responders was 55 and 259 weeks, respectively (P= 0.030). They concluded that
a shorter duration of urticaria was a predictive factor for favorable CsA responses.

Histamine-releasing activity factors (Supplementary Table S2, Table 2)
1) ASST
Seven studies investigated the relationship between ASSTs and clinical responses to CsA

 

(1 RCT; 5 open-labelled, prospective studies; and 1 retrospective study).°"°'7! Three
studies showed a significant association between positive ASSTs and CsA responses.'*3 In
contrast, 4 other studies showed no significant association.° 5°?! The wheal diameter of the
ASST response after CsA treatment was significantly reduced as reported by 3 studies.°!*"
Three studies also reported that the number of positive ASST patients decreased after CsA
treatment.

Grattan et al.° studied 19 CSU patients (13 received CsA; 6 received a placebo). ASSTs were
performed with stored baseline serum on the last day of CsA administration (weeks 4 or 8 for
an open-labelled study) and 2 weeks after stopping CsA. All patients had positive baseline
ASSTs with no significant differences in baseline wheal diameters between the CsA-treated
and placebo groups (P > 0.050). The ASST wheal diameter, 2 weeks after stopping the CsA
treatment was significantly reduced (4.8 vs. 2.1mm, P= 0.040, n = 13). Positive baseline
ASST responses did not predict good clinical responses to CsA, as 10 patients with positive
baseline ASSTs did not respond to treatment.

Endo etal.” studied 34 CSU patients, whose symptoms could not be controlled with up to

 

2-fold of recommended dosage of second-generation AHs, receiving 3 mg/kg/day of CsA for
4 weeks. ASST result was positive in 21 patients and negative in 13 patients. A significant
improvement of UAS7 was found in patients of ASST-positive group more than in those of
the ASST-negative group (P= 0.0048). Therefore, the positive ASST results were suggested as
useful markers for predicting the response to CsA treatment in CSU patients.

Boubouka et al. studied 23 positive ASST CSU patients, receiving 0.55-2.16 mg/kg/day of
CsA. After discontinuing the CsA for 3-6 months, the ASST responses were significantly
suppressed. Eighteen of 23 CSU patients had negative ASST results, and clinical symptoms
were absent (78.3%). Two patients had a positive ASST, but were complete responders
(8.7%), while for 3 patients—despite having negative ASSTs—clinical symptoms were
present (13%). Consequently, ASSTs could not be considered 100% reliable for predicting
treatment responses.

Baskan et al.'* studied 20 CSU patients with positive ASSTs and recalcitrant to antihistamines.
The patients were randomized to receive 4 mg/kg/day of CsA for 4 or 12 weeks. The mean
wheal diameter of the ASST responses was significantly smaller 2 weeks after discontinuing
the CsA than at baseline (1.4 + 2.0 us. 6.2 2.3, P= 0.020 for the 4-week group; 3.5 + 2.8

vs. 6.3 + 2.1, P< 0.0001 for the 12-week group). The authors concluded that CsA provided
clinical improvement for CSU patients with positive ASSTs.

Di Gioacchino et al.” studied 40 patients with severe CSU and positive ASSTs, receiving 4—5
mg/kg/day of CsA for 16 weeks. The ASSTs were performed before CsA treatment, at the
end of treatment, and at least once during relapses of the disease. The ASST results were
scored from 0 to 4+. The mean ASST score was 3 (range: 2-4) at baseline. Of the 16 patients
with complete remission of the disease at the end of treatment, the ASST was negative for

 

13 patients but positive for 3. All patients with relapses continued to have positive ASSTs
but with a significant reduction of their ASST scores (P< 0.002). The reduction of the ASST
scores after CsA was statistically significant for all patients (3.0 vs. 0.3, P= 0.002).

Factors Predicting the Response to Cyclosporin Immunology Research

Toubi et al. studied 19 patients receiving 1-3 mg/kg/day of CsA. The baseline ASSTs were positive

 

for 8/19 patients (42.1%), 5 of which became negative at the end of treatment (3 complete
responders and 2 partial responders). Of the remaining 3 positive ASSTs, 2 patients had
complete responses, while 1 patient had a partial response. There was no significant correlation
between the ASST results and their effectiveness in predicting favorable CsA responses.

Hollander et al.'° studied the ASST scores of 55 CSU patients. The authors concluded that
ASSTs were not predictive of a complete response to CsA treatment (P= 0.340).

2) Basophil histamine release assay (BHRA)

Three studies (1 RCT and 2 retrospective review studies) were included.*"*" All showed that
CSU patients with positive baseline BHRA results responded better to CsA than those with
negative baseline BHRA results. One study reported the suppression of the BHRA response
was significantly increased after CsA.°

Grattan et al.° analyzed the available, paired, pre-/post-treatment sera in 11 out of 14 CSU
patients with positive BHRAs. There was a significant reduction in the mean percentage

of BHRA from 36% to 5% (P< 0.0001). All 11 included patients were clinical responders

to the CsA treatment; their mean UAS reduced from 23.6 to 1.2. A correlation between the
clinical responses and serum BHRAs was reported in 4 patients who responded to CsA and
had been followed for 16 weeks. After CsA treatment, serum BHRA significantly reduced,
corresponding to UAS.

Iqbal et al.* studied 58 severe CSU patients receiving 4 mg/kg/day of CsA. The baseline BHRA
was positive in 27 and negative in 31 patients. Eighty-one percent of the BHRA-positive
patients had complete CsA responses, whereas only 19% of the BHRA-negative patients did
(P< 0.001). The authors concluded that BRHA was useful for predicting complete responses
to CsA treatment in antihistamine-unresponsive CSU patients (P< 0.001).

Hollander et al.'° studied the CU Index (a non-specific histamine release assay) in 24 CSU
patients receiving 1 mg/kg/day of CsA. Ninety-three percent of the patients with a positive
CU Index (defined as 10 or more) achieved complete remissions. A positive CU Index was
therefore found to predict favorable CsA responses (P= 0.050).

Coagulation and inflammatory factors (Supplementary Table $2, Table 3)

1) D-dimer

Asero® performed an open-labelled, prospective study of 29 severe CSU patients receiving
CsA. The baseline plasma D-dimer levels were elevated in 18 of the 29 patients (62%; data
not shown in the table). Seventeen of 29 patients (7 with elevated plasma D-dimer levels; 10
with normal plasma D-dimer levels) were complete responders. Eight patients with elevated
plasma D-dimer levels were partial responders. Four patients (3 with elevated plasma
D-dimer levels; 1 with normal plasma D-dimer levels) were non-responders.

The baseline plasma D-dimer levels showed a statistically significant negative correlation
with the CsA response (P< 0.017). Plasma D-dimer levels during or after the CsA were
available in 11 patients. The elevated baseline plasma D-dimer levels reverted to normal levels
in half of the patients (10/11; 90.9% to 6/11; 54.5%) along with the clinical response. The
authors concluded that plasma D-dimer is useful for monitoring clinical responses to CsA

 

treatment in most patients with severe disease.

2) C-reactive protein (CRP)
Three studies (2 open-labelled, prospective, control studies and 1 open-labelled, prospective

 

study without controls) were identified." "” Recently, Santiago et al.” studied 34 CSU patient
receiving 3 mg/kg/day of CsA for 12 weeks. The CRP levels were elevated in 71% of patients,
but no association with response to CsA treatment. Asero™ studied 29 severe CSU patients
receiving 4 mg/kg/day of CsA. Baseline serum CRP levels were elevated in 5 of 27 patients
(18.5%); of these 5 patients 3 were complete responders. The elevated baseline serum CRP
levels showed no significant association with the clinical responses to CsA.

In contrast, Ohtsuka” studied 15 CSU patients unresponsive to antihistamines, receiving 3
mg/kg/day of CsA and tapering off after 3 months. Baseline high sensitivity-serum CRP levels
were elevated in 9 patients and the levels decreased after CsA treatment in all patients. The
treatment duration was significantly shorter in the elevated high sensitivity-CRP patients
than in the normal serum CRP level patients (P< 0.050). The author concluded that CSU
patients with elevated serum CRP showed good responses to CsA.

3) Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)

Asero® performed an open-labelled, prospective study of 28 patients with severe,
antihistamine-resistant CSU receiving 4 mg/kg/day of CsA. The ESR levels were elevated in 2
of 28 patients (1 complete responder; 1 partial responder), while those of 26 were normal (16
complete responders; 7 partial responders; and 3 non-responders). The study suggested no
significant association between elevated ESR levels and the response to CsA.

Autoantibodies (Supplementary Table $2, Table 4)

1) Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs)

Two retrospective studies’*” examined the association between ANA and response to CsA
treatment. Santiago et al.” reported that 62% of CSU patients had positive ANA but there was
no association with CsA response. Hollander et al. reported that 6 out of 27 CSU patients
had positive ANAs (at a titer of 21:80). All positive ANA patients achieved complete remission
with CsA treatment. The remaining 21 patients had negative ANA results (14 complete
remission; 7 failed treatment). There were no significant differences between the ANA

results before and after CsA treatment (P= 0.100). The study showed there is no significant
association between positive ANAs and CsA responses.

2) Thyroid autoantibodies (TAs)

Three studies (1 open-labelled, prospective study without controls; 2 retrospective studies)
reported on the association between the levels of TAs and CsA responses.'*°” All studies
showed no significant association between the levels of TAs and CsA responses.

Asero® studied 11 CSU patients with positive TAs who received 4 mg/kg/day of CsA. Five
patients (39%) had complete responses, 3 each had partial responses, and non-responses
consecutively. Similarly, Hollander et al.'° and Santiago et al.” reported that the presence of
TAs was not a predictive factor for CsA response in CSU patients, receiving 1 and 3 mg/kg/day
of CsA, respectively (P= 0.920).

3) Other autoantibodies

Endo et al.” studied the association between the concentrations of anti-FceRIa, anti-IgE
autoantibodies and clinical response after CsA, in 34 CSU patients receiving 3 mg/kg/day

of CsA for 4 weeks. There was no significant association between these factors and CsA
response (P= 0.506, P= 0.986, respectively).

 

Cytokines and immunoglobulins (Supplementary Table $2, Table 5)

1) Immunophenotypical analysis of lymphocytes

One open-labelled, prospective study by Loria et al.° examined the association of the
distribution of serum blood T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells before and after short-term CsA
treatment in 10 CSU patients. At baseline, T cells (CD3, CD4, CD8), B cells (CD19), and NK cells
(CD56, CD57) were normal, but high percentage of activated B cells (CD19+CD23+ cells) in all
patients. After CsA treatment, the CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, and CD 19 expression were reduced,
but no statistically significant differences. A decrease in activated B cells was reported in only 2
patients, but the differences in the mean percentages were not statistically significant.

2) Serum immunoglobulins (Igs), C3, C4, circulating immune complexes (CICs)

One open-labelled, prospective study investigated the association of serum Igs, C3, C4
levels and CICs before and after CsA treatment. Loria et al.° studied 20 patients with
antihistamine-resistant CSU. CsA (5 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks) was prescribed for 10 patients,
and prednisolone (20 mg/day for 8 weeks) was prescribed for the other 10. The serum Igs,
C3, and C4 complement levels were normal either before or after receiving CsA treatment,
whereas the CICs were negative before and after treatment with CsA. The findings indicated
that serum Igs, C3, C4 and CICs are not associated with the responses to CsA treatment.

3) Serum IgE

Santiago et al. and Endo et al.? studied the association between serum IgE levels and clinical
responses after 3 mg/kg/day of CsA treatment. They found that clinical responders were
significantly higher in patients with low serum IgE levels than in those with high serum IgE
levels (P= 0.0002 and P= 0.0009, respectively). Taken together, serum IgE levels might be
one of the biomarkers for predicting the response to CsA therapy.

4) Serum IL-2, IL-5, and TNF-a

Serhat Inaloz et al.’ performed an open-labelled, prospective study and reported that the
serum IL-2, IL-5, and TNF-a levels were elevated in all 27 CSU patients before treatment,
with consequent decreases after treatment with CsA. The increase in clinical efficacy and the
significant decreases in serum IL-2, IL-5, and TNF-a levels suggested that inhibition of IL-2,
IL-5, and TNF-a. generation might be involved in the action of CsA. The authors concluded
that there was a significant association between higher levels of serum IL-2, IL-5, and TNF-a
and good responses to CsA treatment.

DISCUSSION

The study of reliable factors could lead to a personalized approach in the management of
CSU and offer objective information regarding response to therapy. Our systematic review
showed that prior histories of urticaria (1 non-RCT); positive ASST results (3 non-RCTs);
positive baseline BHRAs (1 RCT, 2 non-RCTs); elevated baseline plasma D-dimer levels (1
non-RCT); and elevated baseline serum IL-2, IL-5, and TNF-a levels (1 non-RCT) might help
predict favorable CsA responses in CSU patients. Decreased plasma D-dimer levels (1 nonRCT); and decreased serum IL-2 (1 non-RCT), IL-5 (1 non-RCT), TNF-a levels (1 non-RCT),
and low baseline serum IgE levels (2 non-RCTs) after CsA treatment correlated with clinical

improvement; they might be used to monitor clinical CsA responses. However, it should be

 

noted that there is only 1 study regarding a history of urticaria, either acute or chronic.

Histamine-releasing activity can be evaluated by a BHRA and the flow cytometric
measurement of CD63 expression. Basophil activation can induce the release of mediators as
well as the expression of membrane-bound activation markers, such as CD63 and CD203c.**?°
CD63 up-regulation has been shown to be correlated with histamine release from activated
basophils.’ Three studies concluded that CSU patients with positive baseline BHRA results
responded better to CsA than those with negative results. The suppression of the BHRA
response was significantly increased after CsA treatment.*'*°

The pathogenesis of CSU has been reported to be associated with thrombin generation. The
D-dimer level is a marker for fibrin generation and subsequent degradation.” One study
reported that baseline plasma D-dimer levels showed a statistically significant negative
correlation with the CsA response. The authors concluded that plasma D-dimer is useful for
monitoring the clinical response to CsA treatment in most patients with severe diseases.”

Pro-inflammatory cytokines, released from T cells, also play a major role in the pathogenesis
of CSU.” CsA reduced the effect of the transcription factor in T cells that regulate the
transcription of a number of cytokine genes including IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-a.” Serhat Inaloz
et al.’ reported a significant association between higher levels of serum IL-2, IL-5, and TNF-a
and good responses to CsA treatment.

Several limitations should be noted in this study. The results should be interpreted with
caution. First, we cannot exclude the possibility of publication bias as the majority of
included articles were observational studies, which did not have pre-registered study
protocols. Therefore, they might not report negative results. In addition, the included studies
did not adjust the results for potential confounders and we cannot be certain whether the
observed results were a function of the variable of interest or confounders. The sample size
in observation studies is also frequently not optimized for a hypothesis testing. Therefore,
the lack of statistical significance may be simply due to the lack of statistical power and does
not suggest the lack of clinical relevance. Secondly, a general problem in the assessment of
potential factors is the lack of specificity for the predicting factors. For example, D-dimer

or CRP levels have been shown to be elevated in CSU and to correlate with the responses to
treatment. However, they can be elevated in many other diseases (¢.g., chronic infections and
autoimmune disorders). Moreover, the differences in the study designs and the ages of the
patients included in various studies should be taken into consideration: these factors could
have influenced the outcomes of the potential-factor assessments. RCTs regarding factors
that could potentially predict a favorable response to CsA treatment for CSU are needed

to fulfil the gap. Thirdly, only 5 of 13 articles described marketed formulations of CsA (the
microemulsion or the original formulation) which may have affected the interpretation of
response to CsA in each study.

In conclusion, since most positive results were from non-RCT articles and some data were
still inconsistent, this systematic review identified no reliable practical biomarker for
predicting CsA treatment response. There were no positive predictors with good consistency
and mechanical plausibility.
