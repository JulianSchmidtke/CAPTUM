Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria in Taiwan: A Clinical
Study of Demographics, Aggravating Factors,
Laboratory Findings, Serum Autoreactivity and

Treatment Response
Hsing-Chuan Lee,"? Jin-Bon Hong,’ Chia-Yu Chu'*

Background/Purpose: Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is not uncommon, yet there is little information about the clinical features of CIU patients in Taiwan. The purpose of this study was to investigate the
clinical features of CIU in Taiwan.

Methods: Patients with CIU were collected consecutively from the Urticaria Special Clinic in a medical
center in northern Taiwan from December 2005 to May 2006. Clinical features and laboratory findings
were studied. We also evaluated the therapeutic response of CIU patients with second-generation H1
receptor antagonist monotherapy for 6 weeks.

Results: A total of 62 CIU patients were investigated. The female to male ratio was 2.1:1 with a mean age
of 31.8 years. The mean duration of the disease was 25.7 months (1.5-180 months). The most common
aggravating factor was weather (79.7%), especially hot weather (50.8%). Fifty percent of the patients had
atopy, and 37.3% of patients had positive autologous serum skin test. Besides, 61.3% of patients had at
least one serum specific IgE antibody to the 18 common allergens examined. Finally, 60.7% of patients
responded well to second-generation H1 receptor antagonist. Non-responders tended to have atopy
(p=0.0471), especially allergic rhinitis (p =0.0107).

Conclusions: This study provided an overview of CIU patients in a medical center in northern Taiwan. We
found that atopy did not influence the severity or durtation of CIU. Nevertheless, atopy was associated
with a poor therapeutic response of second-generation antihistamine. A survey of personal atopy history,
especially allergic rhinitis, is important for management of CIU patients in Taiwan.

Urticaria is a rather common disease worldwide,
affecting 15-30% of the population.!~*° Thirty
percent of the cases become chronic, which is defined as wheals with daily or almost daily appearance for more than 6 weeks. There are three main
subtypes of chronic urticaria (CU), including physical urticaria (35%), chronic idiopathic urticaria
(60%), and urticarial vasculitis (5%).> Physical urticaria is traditionally included in the non-restrictive
definition of chronic urticaria.? Based on the
special eliciting physical factors, it is categorized
separately in some classifications.’ Urticarial vasculitis presents as fixed wheals for more than 1 day
with histologically proved vasculitis. What is not
categorized above is chronic idiopathic urticaria
(CIU). Up to 50% of patients with CIU were found
to be related to an underlying autoimmune mechanism.° Autologous serum skin test (ASST) is a
clinical test that is generally available to detect autoreactivity in patients with CIU in vivo. Although
many efforts and achievements had been done
for CU in Taiwan," little information was
mentioned about the clinical features of CIU in
Taiwanese population. The aim of this study was
to analyze the demographics, aggravating factors,
laboratory findings, serum autoreactivity of patients with CIU in Taiwan. The effectiveness of
therapy and prognostic factors are also discussed.

Methods

Patients

This study was conducted at the Urticaria Special
Clinic of Department of Dermatology, National
Taiwan University Hospital from December 2005
to May 2006 and had been approved by the
Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committees of
National Taiwan University Hospital. Written informed consents were obtained from patients. The
patient population included subjects of 18 years
old or older who had documented signs and symptoms of CIU for 6 weeks and had a CIU flare for
3 weeks or more, with urticarial lesions visible
3 days or more per week. Patients with a definite
diagnosis of CIU were recruited consecutively in

this Special Clinic. Patients with physical urticaria or
urticatial vasculitis, or receiving any antihistamines,
corticosteroids, ketotifen, systemic antibiotics, nedocromil, sodium cromoglycate or thyroxin drug
within 7 days preceding the study, were excluded.

Patients were subjected to a diagnostic protocol at the Day-7 (screening day, visit 1), including
a complete history of possible causes and aggravating factors, past history and test of dermographism. All patients filled in a questionnaire,
which was designed for the following data: demographic characteristics, personal and familial
histories of atopic diathesis, duration of the disease and individual lesion, systemic diseases, and
aggravating factors.

ASST

ASST was conducted at Day-7 by intradermal injection of 0.05 mL of fresh, sterile serum into the
volar aspect of the forearm. An equal amount of
sterile saline and histamine was injected into the
other forearm as negative and positive controls.
The result was evaluated after 30 minutes. Positive reaction was defined when the serum-induced
wheal was red, with a diameter 1.5 mm wider
than the saline-control.°

Laboratory investigation

Patients received laboratory investigation including complete blood cell counts with cell differentiation, erythrocyte sedimentary rate (ESR), aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), alanine transferase (ALT),
creatinine, anti-microsomal and anti-thyroglobulin
antibodies, and Pharmacia CAP System fluoroimmunoassay (Pharmacia Diagnostics AB, Uppsala,
Sweden) for specific serum IgE antibodies to 18
common allergens at the screening day. A value
of 20.35 kU/L (CAP-Class 1) was considered as
positive.”

Therapeutic protocol

Each patient received low-sedation, secondgeneration H1 receptor antagonist antihistamine
monotherapy, either levocetirizine 5 mg or desloratadine 5 mg daily, for 6 weeks. Patients had visits
on the Day-7 (screening day, visit 1), within 3 days

after Day 0 (baseline, visit 2), Day 14+3 days
(visit 3), Day 28 + 3 days (visit 4), and Day 42+3
days (visit 5). Evaluation of symptom scores for
each patient was performed by an investigator at
visits 2-5 (Table 1). Therapeutic response was assessed at visits 3-5 using the following scoring
system: 1=complete relief (virtually no signs/
symptoms), 2=marked relief (signs/symptoms
greatly improved and cause little trouble), 3=
moderate relief (signs/symptoms present and
troublesome but noticeably improved), 4=slight
relief (minimal improvement in signs/symptoms),
5 =treatment failure (signs/symptoms unchanged
or worse than baseline). Patients were grouped
according to the therapeutic response. Good responder was defined as complete or marked relief (score <2) at the visits 3-5. Non-responder
was defined as slight relief or treatment failure
(score24) at the visits 3-5. The patients else
were the poor-responders. The relationship of
therapeutic response with demographics, ASST
and outcomes of laboratory investigation was assessed. We also analyzed the influence of atopy
or positive ASST on symptom scores.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics was used to summarize the
demographic and laboratory data. Continuous
data was delineated by mean + standard deviation.
Categorical variables were described as n (%).
Missing data was not included when calculating

percentage. Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon Rank
Sum Test were used to analyze categorical variables
among the therapeutic response, ASST, and atopy.
Ap value of less than 0.05 was considered statistical
significant. Logistic regression analysis was used to
evaluate the relationship between atopy and ASST
with symptom scores. Analyses were done with SAS
software version 8.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

Results

Demographic data

A total of 62 subjects with CIU were investigated.
Of the 62 patients with CIU, 42 were female (68%)
and 20 were male (32%) (female to male ratio=
2.1:1) (Table 2). Their age ranged from 18 years
to 61 years (mean age, 31.8 + 10.4 years; median,
29.5 years). The mean duration of the disease was
25.7 months (range, 1.5-180 months). The mean
duration of individual lesion was 4.0 hours (range,
from 10 minutes to 24 hours). Thirty-one patients
(50%) had personal history of atopy and 28
(45.2%) patients had allergic rhinitis. Thirty patients (48.4%) had family history of atopy. Nine
patients (14.5%) had family history of urticaria.
The most common aggravating factor was weather
(79.7%), especially hot weather (Table 3). Two of
the 45 patients (4.4%) had angioedema. Twentytwo of the 59 patients (37.3%) had positive result
of ASST. Six patients (9.7%) had thyroid disease.

Laboratory tests

Five of 60 patients (8.3%) were noted to have
autoimmune antibodies to thyroid [4 patients
(7.3%) had anti-microsomal antibody, 2 (3.6%)
had anti-thyroglobulin antibody]. Most of the patients had normal blood cell counts, AST and ALT.
All the available data of serum creatinine was normal. Besides, 29.6% patients had increased sedimentation rate. Pharmacia CAP specific allergen
tests revealed that Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus was the most common allergen (51.6%),
followed by Dermatophagoides farinae (50%)
and shrimps (25.8%) (Table 4). Thirty-eight patients (61.3%) had at least one serum specific IgE
antibody to the 18 common allergens examined.

Therapeutic response

The response of low-sedation, second-generation
H1 receptor antagonist antihistamine monotherapy for 6 weeks was evaluated. Thirty patients
received desloratadine and 32 patients received
levocetirizine. No significant difference of therapeutic efficacy was noted between the two treatment groups in 6 weeks (p>0.05). Thirty-four

patients (60.7%) were good responders, while
five patients (8.9%) were non-responders. Seventeen patients (30.4%) belonged to the group of
poor-responders. Non-responders were more likely
to have allergic rhinitis (p= 0.0107), personal history of atopy (p=0.0471), and specific IgE antibody to crab (p=0.0321).

ASST and symptom score

In addition, we evaluated if positivity of ASST
had any influence about the baseline symptom
score (visit 2). The result showed no statistically
significance between positivity of ASST with pruritus, number of hives, size of the largest hive,
interference with sleep, interference with daily
activities, and sum of each patient's symptom
score (p>0.05).

Atopy and symptom score

As for the relationship between atopy and baseline symptom score, atopy did not influence degree of pruritus, number of hives, size of largest
hive, interference with sleep, and interference
with daily activities and sum of each patient's
symptom score (p>0.05).

Discussion

This is a prospective, analytic, cross-sectional,
single-center study including 62 patients with CIU
in Taiwan. The female preponderance in this study
was in concordance with other European and
Asian studies.!?-™4 Fifty percent of our patients
were noted to have atopy. The most common associated condition was allergic rhinitis (45.2%), followed by asthma (8.1%), allergic conjunctivitis
(8.1%) and atopic dermatitis (4.8%). For adults
in Taiwan, the prevalence of atopy was 23.3%, allergic rhinitis was 17.9%, asthma was 3.5-7.8%,
and atopic dermatitis was 5.0%.!°!® There was no
data about the prevalence of allergic conjunctivitis
in adults in Taiwan. Comparing with the information, our data implied that atopy, especially
allergic rhinitis, occurred more frequently in
patients with CIU than in the general adult pop1417 it is still

equivocal if there is a link between CIU and atopy.

ulation. Reviewing the literature,

Results were controversial and may be partially
contributed to the definition of atopy. In Nassif’s
study, more than 90% of CIU patients examined
had a personal history of atopic disease. Nassif'
defined atopy as the existence of one or more
past or present recurrent items previously diagnosed by a physician: asthma and/or eczema and/
or allergic rhino-conjunctivitis. When defining
atopy more strictly with personal history of atopic
diseases and sensitization to at least one common allergen confirming by positive skin prick
tests in Augey et al’s study,’’ the results did not
support the hypothesis that chronic urticaria affects mostly atopic patients. However, they still
found that 43% of the studied chronic urticaria
patients had personal history of atopy.'’ In addition, our study revealed that atopy did not influence disease severity or disease duration of CIU;
nevertheless, it was associated with poor therapeutic response of second-generation antihistamine
with standard dose in our patients with CIU. We
proposed a survey of personal atopy history especially allergic rhinitis is important for managing
patients with CIU in Taiwan, because it may predict
poor responders for standard dose of antihistamine

treatment. On the other hand, the current guideines has advocated that increased dosing of
second-generation of antihistamines up to fourold benefit patients with urticaria who do not
respond to standard doses.'* Second-generation
antihistamines with higher doses might have
additional anti-inflammatory or immunomoduatory effects to control refractory urticaria.!®!°
For patients with atopy, treatment with higher
dosage of second-generation antihistamines may

 

be needed to control disease activity of CIU.
Therefore, it should be further studied if atopy
is still associated with poor therapeutic response
of second-generation antihistamine with higher
dosage.

There is emergence of evidence that up to
50% of patients with CIU could be explained by
an underlying autoimmune basis involving antihigh affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) antibodies or antiIgE antibodies.” These antibodies are functional,
leading to mast cell and basophil activation and
release of histamine and other pro-inflammatory
mediators.? Although the basophil histamine release assay (HRA) remains the gold standard investigation to detect functional autoantibodies in
vitro, it is time consuming with high inter-assay
variability and can be carried out only in selected
centers.”° ASST therefore is a more popular screening in vivo test to detect basophil histaminereleasing activity when HRA is not available.
A correlation between the presence of anti-FceRI
and anti-IgE autoantibodies and positive ASST
was documented.” It has a sensitivity of 70%
and specificity of 80%.° It elicits an immediate
wheal-and-flare response in 30-50% of CIU patients.*!7° In our study population, 37.3% of
them showed a positive reaction to ASST, which
was close to the previous reports.** In addition,
some studies showed that patients with positive
ASST presented more severe clinical features than
serum-negative subjects.!*?* Such a phenomenon
was further studied that basophils of patients with
CIU had altered IgE receptor-mediated degranulation. Ex vivo activation of the blood basophils
with an optimal dose of cross-linking anti-IgE antibodies was grouped into two phenotypes based

on the degree of histamine release: responder
(210% histamine release) and nonresponder
(< 10% histamine release). Basophils of CIU patients with a responder phenotype had reduced
Src-homology 2-containing—5’-inositol phosphatase (SHIP)-1 protein levels, an inhibitor in the
FceRI histamine degranulation pathway.”* This may
explain partially that CIU patients with positive
ASST reported more disease severity. However, in
our study, we found that the severity of attacks was
not higher in subjects with positive ASST. This may
be due to the followings: (1) our sample size was
too small to elucidate the clinical significance of
ASST with CIU; (2) auto-reactivity accounted only
partially for the etiology of CIU (still 41% of
patients with CIU had no identified factor,>
other cellular or subcellular, rather than humoral
factors may be involved in the pathogenesis and
influence disease severity);?4 (3) these autoantibodies were also detected in subjects in remission
and even in normal subjects, and the antibody
functional activity may also depend on the receptor being occupied by its natural ligand;" and
(4) ASST does not actually prove the presence of
antibodies, but rather shows histamine-releasing
properties of the tested serum.”° Therefore, ASST
cannot be used alone to predict the severity of
urticaria and may not be sufficient to define CIU
as “autoimmune”.?>

The association of CIU with thyroid autoimmunity has been studied.”° Thyroid autoimmunity
was more prevalent in CIU patients (14-29%)
than in population controls (5-6%).”° It has been
postulated that thyroid autoimmunity may play
a role in the pathogenesis of CIU, but most studies
have suggested that antithyroid antibodies (ATA)
are not a direct causative agent in CU.?”8 It appears more likely that ATA and anti-IgE receptor
antibodies are associated, parallel, auto-immune
events.?° In the present study, only 7.3% patients
had antimicrosomal antibodies and 3.6% had antithyroglobulin antibodies, which were lower
than in previous studies.!*?°>° Our data suggested
that the association of thyroid autoimmunity is
not so prevalent in Taiwanese CIU patients. The result may be influenced by the less specific thyroid

microsomal antibodies and small sample size
for the low prevalence of thyroid auto-immunity.

Due to the high proportion of atopy noted in
the study, we evaluated 18 common allergen specific IgE antibodies by Pharmacia CAP System
specific allergen test. Results showed that 61.3%
of patients had at least one serum specific IgE
antibody to the 18 common allergens. This may
contribute to high proportion of atopy in our
study. Thirty-two patients (51.6%) were noted to
have specific IgE to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. In these 32 patients, 19 patients had atopy
(including 1 atopic dermatitis, 5 asthma, 17 allergic rhinitis, and 2 allergic conjunctivitis). We
further analyzed if there was any difference between positive Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus
group (32 patients) and negative Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus group (30 patients) about
disease duration, symptom scores and therapeutic
response. Yet, all the data revealed no statistical
significance (p>0.05).

In conclusion, this study provided a clinical
analysis of patients with CIU in Taiwan. We found
female predominance and increased prevalence
of atopy. Besides, atopy did not influence disease
severity or duration of CIU but the therapeutic
response of second-generation antihistamines.
About 60% of the patients had good response to
low-sedation, second-generation H1 receptor antagonists. Non-responders were more likely to
have atopy, especially allergic rhinitis. Additional
multicenter studies with a larger sample size and
longer duration of treatment are warranted to
characterize patients with CIU in Taiwan.
