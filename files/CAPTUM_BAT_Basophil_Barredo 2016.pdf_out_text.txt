Introduction

Abstract

Introduction: The basophil activation test showing CD63 up regulation could be a
specific and sensitive in vitro complementary text to the in vivo autologous serum
skin test for the activity assessment of the patients suffering autoimmune chronic
spontaneous urticaria. The aim of this study is to define the basophil activation test
as a useful tool in clinical practice in order to identify those patients with more
active disease.

Methods: We screened 139 patients (96 women) diagnosed of chronic spontaneous
urticaria using simultaneously autologous serum skin test and basophil activation
test and their relationship with disease activity.

Results: Positive autologous serum skin test was found in 56.8%; from them,
31.6% were basophil activation test positive. Negative autologous serum skin test
result was found in the 43.2% of the sample that showed negative CD63 expression
results in all cases, except one. Patients with positive autologous serum skin test and
positive CD63 by basophil activation test showed significant higher Urticaria
Activity Score of 7 days (P = 0.004) and of 3 weeks (P = 0.001) than patients with
positive autologous serum skin test and negative CD63 (mean + standard
deviation [SD] 26.57 + 10.56 versus 18.40 + 12.05 for the Urticaria Activity Score
of 7 days and 56.47 + 23.78 versus 39.88 + 25.44 for the Urticaria Activity Score of
3 weeks).
Conclusions: The CD63 expression on basophils appears as a reliable in vitro
marker, useful in clinical practice in combination with autologous serum skin test
to define chronic spontaneous urticaria patients with the highest urticaria activity
that impairs a normal life.

 

 

 

 

 

autoantibodies against the high-affinity immunoglobulin E
(IgE)-receptor (FceRla) or IgE itself in patients with

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is defined as the
appearance of evanescent wheals; angioedema or both that
persist for longer than 6 weeks. It is the most common
subtype of chronic urticaria, having a significant impact in
quality of life [1]. The clinical and serologic criteria defining
autoimmune CSU are still a matter of research [2]. The in
vivo autologous serum skin test (ASST) is the diagnostic
tool for evaluation of serum autoreactivity mostly due to

CSU [3]. The basophil histamine release assay (BHRA),
when is positive is defined as one of the criteria of
autoimmune CSU and its assessment is recommended [4].
BHRA isa safe and reliable diagnostic tool, but is usually not
routinely available in our daily clinical practice.

In recent years, the quantification of basophil activation
by flow cytometry (basophil activation test, BAT) has been
proposed as a proven useful tool for the assessment of

responses to allergens mediated by IgE. In such test, the
patient serum is coincubated with donor basophils and the
activation is measured. Most BAT studies have used CD63 or
CD203c as good basophil activation markers after antigenspecific stimulation [3]. The CD63 molecule is a tetraspan
granule protein that is not expressed on resting basophils but
is up regulated after its activation. BAT with CD63 up
regulation has been established as a specific and sensitive in
vitro alternative to ASST to identify functional autoantibodies (specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding IgE or its
high affinity receptor) in CSU [5-7]. Some heterogeneous
results have been published in relation to methodological
differences using different basophil donors. BAT offers some
advantages compared with the ASST to be implemented in

 

clinical practice providing quantifiable results suitable to
monitor the course of the disease and its treatment [8]. The
possibility that BAT may replace ASST in a near future as
a diagnostic standard procedure to identify autoreactive
serum factors in CSU has been postulated [9].

Our objective was to show if the use of BAT routinely,
in combination with ASST, in daily clinical practice of
management of patients with CSU could help us confirm
those patients with more active disease.

Materials and Methods
Patients and urticaria assessment

We aimed to assess the diagnostic practical usefulness of the
simultaneous evaluation of ASST and BAT in 139 patients
with CSU (96 women and 43 men, mean age + standard
deviation [SD]): 45.5+14.7) and their relationship with
activity of the disease, measured using the Urticaria Activity
Score [10] from the day before (UAS; 0-6), the 7 days before
(UAS7; 0-42) and the 3 weeks before (UAS3w; 0-126) the
baseline clinical assessment. The UAS7 (0-42) is a validated
patient report outcome including two parameters number of
wheals (0-21) and intensity of itch (0-21). The UAS from
the 3 weeks before helps to assess such patients with active
CSU partially controlled that maybe do not show active
symptoms immediately before the medical consultation but
CSU is still active.

The diagnosis of urticaria was based on clinical history
data and physical examination. Those patients with urticaria

 

 

vasculitis or other urticarial syndromes different from
urticaria were excluded. All patients aged more than 16 years
with a diagnosis of active CSU from at least the previous
6 months. All patients were studied prospectively according
with the complete protocol for CSU, following the European
guidelines [11]. Diagnostic interventions were informed and
approved by the patients. At the baseline assessment the
patients were free of any active treatment. A blanching
period of at least 15 days for antihistamines, 3 weeks for any

L. Curto-Barredo et al.

immunosuppressive, and 30 days for anti-IgE treatment was
guaranteed. Patients diagnosed of CSU showing an active
disease along the 4 weeks before were included. Study 2013/
5363/I approved by the ethic committee, CEIC-Parc de Salut
Mar, IMIM-Hospital del Mar.

Combined use of the ASST and the BAT

Positive reaction for ASST was defined when the diameter of
serum-induced wheal was >1.5mm compared to salineinduced response at 30min [12]. Total IgE levels were
measured by the ImmunoCAP system and the antithyroglobulin and thyroperoxydase antibodies were detected
by radioimmunoassay as part of the routine study protocol
of all CSU patients.

BAT was performed, measuring expression of the CD63
surface marker on basophils from whole blood by flow
cytometry using a commercial kit (Flow2CAST, Buhlmann
laboratories) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The basophils used for this test were obtained from different
healthy donors.

Briefly, within 2h after venipuncture, 50 pl of EDTAblood were mixed with: (i) 50 yl of patient serum or 50 pl of
healthy serum (negative control) or 50 yl of a solution
containing anti-FceRI monoclonal antibody (positive control-1 provided by the kit), or 50 pl of a solution containing
fMLP (positive control-2 provided by the kit); (ii) 100 pl
of stimulation buffer containing calcium, heparine, and
IL-3 [13] (provided by the kit); (iii) and 20 wl of a mix of
FITC-conjugated anti-CD63 and PE-conjugated anti-CCR3
monoclonal antibodies (provide by the kit). After incubation
for 15min at 37°C, samples were lysed and washed with
reagents provided by the kit and cells were adquired in a
FACS Canto cytometer (Beckton—Dickinson, San Jose, CA).
Basophils were identified as CCR3+-cells with low site
scatter SSC. At least 500 basophils were acquired and
analysed for CD63 expression. Two conditions were
required to consider a BAT positive: (i) the percentage of
CD63+ basophils >5%, and (ii) the stimulation index
(SI= % CD63-+ induced by the serum patient divided by %
CD63+ induced by the negative control) must be equal or
higher than 2.

This selection led us to apply this technology in the
routine clinical practice beyond the research field.

 

 

Statistic assessment

 

The relationship between the obtained results and the
severity of the disease was evaluated statistically by using an
unpaired two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. All the descriptive
and inferential analyses were done by means of the SPSS
program (version 15). P values<0.05 were considered
significant.

Results

The clinical features, severity scores and main results of
ASST and BAT are summarized in Table 1. From the total
sample, the mean+SD of serum IgE was 145.38 +150
(1.3-909) KU/L, slightly above of the normal values (0100 kU/L) as it was expected. This finding was observed for
the first time during the omalizumab trials and its clinical
relevance, especially for free-IgE levels is still a matter of
study but according with the role of IgE and FceRla in
CSU [14]. Twenty-two percent of the patients who were
tested for thyroid function had clinical or subclinical thyroid
disease. This association between autoimmune thyroid
disease and CSU is well known and is one of the clinical
associations that contributed to build the autoimmune
hypothesis [15, 16].

Positive skin reactivity (positive ASST) was found in
56.8% of the sample in agreement with previous published
data of positive ASST frequency ranges [17]. The high
percentage of positivity in ASST can be explained by the fact,

From that positivity in ASST patients, 31.6% showed a
positive BAT as determined by expression of CD63 and
68.4% were negative. ASST negative result was found in the
43.2% of the sample that showed negative CD63 expression
results in all cases, except one case. In our hands, the ASST
previously performed in 22 healthy controls was always
negative.

Patients with positive ASST and whose sera induced
CD63 expression on heterologous basophils showed significantly higher scores in UAS (mean+SD 4.26 + 1.84,
P=0.003), UAS7 (26.57 + 10.56, P= 0.002), and UAS3w
(61.87 + 25.62, P= 0.001) than patients with negative ASST
and CD63 results. Patients with positive ASST and positive
CD63 expression by BAT showed higher UAS and UAS7
(P=0.004 in both cases) and UAS3w (P=0.001) than
positive ASST and negative CD63 expression (ASST+/
CD63- group: UAS 2.92 + 1.75, UAS7 18.40 + 12.05, UAS3w
39.88 + 25.44) (Fig. 1). No significant differences on the
UAS, UAS7, or UAS3w were observed just assessing positive
ASST neither versus negative ASST patients nor versus
positive ASST and negative patients once the expression of
CD63 by BAT was negative. All the patients with positive
BAT, except one were positive for ASST, resulting in a high
specificity of 98.3%. However, only 31.6% of the serum of all
the patients with positive ASST induced CD63 expression
(sensitivity of 31.6%). In addition, all healthy donors sera
(n=9) showed a negative CD63 expression by BAT.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Discussion

The current results in this experimental approach show that
a 68.4% of the in vivo autoreactive serum samples did not
activated the basophils from healthy donors and that the
serum of 31.6% of all the patients with positive ASST
induced a CD63 expression on heterologous basophils. This
percentage is low compared with other previous studies that
showed an up-regulation of CD63 expression in 70% of
patients with positive ASST [6]. But this refered study, report
a 45% of negative ASST patients with positive CD63
expression, this fact imply decreased rate of specificity. The
specificity in our study is of 98.3% comparable with the
90.5% described previously [18]. However, very low 31.6%
sensitivity is observed as compared with the 95.5% found in
other studies that include less number of samples and just
two selected donors of basophils [18]. These differences can
be explained partially by the basophil donor variability
(healthy subjects) in our study. In our study, there was not a
selection of a specific donor example a special population
such as atopic patients and we used different healthy donors.
Interestingly, patients with negative ASST showed a negative
BAT independently of the activity of CSU. So, our finding

indicates that the CD63 expression by BAT provides no falsepositive results and was limited to those patients with serum
autoreactivity, demonstrating high specificity. Significantly,
the CSU patients with positive ASST whose serum induced
expression of CD63 showed the most active disease (higher
UAS scores) being suitable to use high dose of antihistamines
joint with third line treatment. The percentage of patients
ASST+/CD63+ that required third line of treatment
according with the European guidelines (Cyclosporine A
or Omalizumab) was in our study the 32% compared with
the 16.66% ASST+/CD63-. When ASST-/CD63- a 30.50%
of patients required also third line of treatment suggesting
other mechanisms involved in the development of the wheals
than those involved in autoimmunity.

The basophil activation test through CD63 expression
might be a reliable and safe test helping to identify the most
active CSU patients showing positive autoreactive serum.
The CD203c molecule has been proposed as an alternative in
chronic urticaria patients with severe disease that could be
used also as a severity marker [19]; however, this marker led
to variable activation patterns that are better controlled by
CD63 when healthy basophil donors are used. A significant
correlation between the basophil histamine release and the
CD63 assays was observed using basophils of two selected no
atopic and atopic donors, and the ASST showed a strong
correlation with the histamine release only when the
basophils were from an atopic donor [20].

The BAT test offers some advantages over ASST that must
be taken into consideration in clinical practice. Some of these
advantages would be: it is a valid technique to identify
patients expressing anti-IgE antibodies and anti IgE
receptor, its good correlation with CSU activity would
allow disease treatment monitoring, it is a technique less
invasive and applicable without problem at any age.

 

Despite the variability in basophil donors, our good
coincidence between tests gains special relevance in the
context of the clinical routine in order to implement the
CD63 without the need of a selection of high sensitive
basophil donor to favour the CD63 expression and the
profitability of the technique, as most studies do [6, 20];
thus, we get close an indicator for routine diagnostics. These
results allow us to recommend the implementation of the
BAT technique routinely with reliable results (assuming all
the possible limitations). According to our results, the
assessment of the CD63 expression by BAT may be
considered as an in vitro biological marker of disease
activity.

BAT technique helped us to confirm in our daily practice
the identification of the most active patients suffering CSU
according with UAS7. Although, the UAS7 is a valid
instrument it is a patient report outcome it depends on the
opinion and the will of the patient. A battery of useful
biomarkers in clinical practice would be necessary and is
desirable in CSU. In the search for clinical features and
laboratory findings that would help us to identify and
confirm the more active patients suffering of CSU, BAT can
be considered a useful tool.
