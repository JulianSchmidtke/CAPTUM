ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND: Omalizumab is indicated for the management of chronic
idiopathic urticaria (CIU) in patients aged 12 years or older with persistent
hives that are not adequately controlled by H1 antihistamines. While its safety and efficacy in CIU patients have been evaluated in multiple clinical trials,
real-world use of omalizaumab in CIU has not been well characterized.

OBJECTIVE: To assess demographics, clinical characteristics, and treatment patterns of CIU patients who initiated omalizumab to better understand the usage of this agent in CIU management in the real world.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used medical and pharmacy
claims data in the United States from the HealthCore Integrated Database
to identify patients with CIU newly treated with omalizumab (= 4 omalizumab claims within 6 months of the initial claim) between March 21, 2014,
and October 31, 2015 (study intake period). The index date was defined as
the date of the first claim for omalizumab during the study intake period.
Demographic and clinical characteristics were described for patients
treated with omalizumab, as were treatment patterns associated with
omalizumab and concomitant medications associated with CIU treatment.
Descriptive and inferential statistics were reported. The Kaplan-Meier
method was used to examine omalizumab treatment patterns.

RESULTS: This study included 298 omalizumab-treated patients (mean [SD]
age of 43.5 [13.64] years; 70.8% female); approximately 84% were seen
by an allergist/immunologist. All patients had = 12 months of continuous
enrolment and a subset of 138 patients had = 18 months of follow-up. For
patients with =12 months of post-index follow-up, 12.1% (n= 36), 28.5%
(n=85), and 32.9% (n=98) discontinued omalizumab within the 6-month,
12-month, and the entire post-index periods (mean 530 days), respectively;
the mean number of days patients were continuously treated with omalizumab was 443.1 (95% Cl=425.0-461.3); the probabilities of continuous
treatment (95% Cl) were 0.879 (0.836-0.911), 0.711 (0.656-0.759), and
0.647 (0.585-0.703) for the 6-, 12-, and 18-month post-index periods,
respectively. For the 98 patients who discontinued omalizumab during

the entire post-index period, 28.6% restarted omalizumab after the first
discontinuation within the post-index period (mean time from first discontinuation to first restart=329 days). Use of medications such as oral corticosteroids, montelukast, cyclosporine, and prescription H1 and H2 antihistamines decreased during the 1- to 6-month and 7- to 12-month post-index
periods compared with those within the 6-month pre-index period.

CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of CIU patients who were newly prescribed
omalizumab, the majority were treated by allergists/immunologists as
expected, and approximately 60% of patients continued on therapy beyond
18 months. Concomitant medication use decreased after omalizumab initiation. These data on the real-world use of omalizumab for CIU may help to
better inform decision-making processes for health care payers by quantifying omalizumab and concomitant medication treatment patterns over a
longer time frame relative to previous studies.

What is already known about this subject

* A step-care approach has been developed for management of
chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU).

* Safety and efficacy data regarding use of omalizumab in CIU
patients are available from multiple randomized clinical trials.

* Outcomes data are available from very few retrospective observational studies with short follow-up periods, studies with
relatively small sample sizes, or studies performed outside of the
United States.

What this study adds

» This study provides information on real-world treatment patterns
for omalizumab in the United States for longer periods than previously reported in clinical trials.

* Long-term real-world data are reported on changes in clinical
characteristics and concomitant medication use among CIU
patients initiating omalizumab in the United States.

hronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), also referred to as

chronic spontaneous urticaria, is characterized by the

appearance of either itchy hives or angioedema or both
without any detectable cause that persist for at least 6 weeks.'*
The symptoms of CIU, which include swelling of the skin, significant itching, pain in affected areas, and general discomfort,
are unpredictable and variable and may continue for periods
lasting several months to years.*? Currently, an estimated
1.5 million people are affected by CIU in the United States.*°
CIU occurs twice as frequently among women compared with
men in the general population and symptoms typically begin
between 20 and 40 years of age.*”

The management of CIU relies on a stepwise approach.?*°
Second-generation H1 antihistamines are regarded as first-line
treatment for CIU and appear to be effective in a large segment
of the patient population; however, as many as 50% of patients
have an inadequate response and fail to achieve complete
control,* even when dosing was increased up to 4-fold above
standard doses.**"° H2 antihistamines or leukotriene receptor
antagonists (LTRAs) such as montelukast, combined with second-generation H1 antihistamines, are considered second-line
treatment for patients with persistently severe urticaria despite

high-dose H1 antihistamine treatment as described in the
Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters /American Academy of
Allergy, Asthma & Immunology/American College of Allergy,
Asthma & Immunology document.* However, urticaria does
not always improve with combined treatment, especially
among patients with severe urticaria.'°

Omalizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against IgE,"!
was approved in the United States for uncontrolled moderate to
severe persistent allergic asthma in 2003 and became a treatment option for CIU after U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approval on March 21, 2014. It is indicated for CIU
in adults and children 12 years of age or older who remain
symptomatic despite treatment with H1 antihistamines.'* The
package insert states that the appropriate duration of therapy
has not been evaluated and that the need for continued therapy
should be reassessed periodically. The safety and efficacy o
omalizumab in treating CIU have been evaluated in multiple
clinical trials.!'*!° In three phase 3 studies, ASTERIA II,'*+
GLACIAL,” and ASTERIA I,!° CIU symptoms were reduced
after patients were treated with omalizumab. Postapprova
data are only available from a handful of small, short-duration,
observational studies, mostly conducted outside the United
States?"
As a result, information on the real-world treatment experience of patients receiving omalizumab for CIU is deficient.
Specifically, data are lacking on the interval between courses 0
treatment with omalizumab and how omalizumab is used as a
long-term therapy for managing CIU.?*° This study examined
patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and treatment
patterns among CIU patients initiating omalizumab to better
understand real-world use of this agent in the management o!
CIU patients. While this study focused largely on patients with
212 months of follow-up, it also reports findings from a subset
of patients with > 18 months of follow-up to gain insights into
longer treatment periods.

 

 

 

 

ll Methods

Study Design

This observational cohort study queried medical and pharmacy
claims data, curated in the HealthCore Integrated Database
(HIRD), for patients with CIU who initiated omalizumab treatment between March 21, 2014, and October 31, 2015. The
HIRD is a repository of longitudinal administrative claims data
for enrollees in 14 major regional health plans and is largely
representative of the U.S. Census population.*® The date of the
first claim for omalizumab during the study intake period was
defined as the index date and the full time period of the study was
from September 20, 2013, to April 30, 2016. All study data were
managed in strict compliance with applicable Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability ACT (HIPAA) rules, and data
deidentification procedures were employed to preserve patient
anonymity and confidentiality throughout the study process.

Study Population and Eligibility Criteria

Patients who satisfied the study definition of omalizumab
treatment,’ defined as at least 4 medical or pharmacy claims
of omalizumab (Current Procedural Terminology code: J2357;
General Product Identifier code: 44603060002120) within the
6-month post-index period, were included. The number of
medical and pharmacy claims was determined from distinct
claim dates for omalizumab. Only patients with CIU in the
as 21 medical
claim for an inpatient stay or emergency department (ED) visit

study period were included. This was defined

with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
Clinical Modification (CD-9-CM) or International Classification of
Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis code for urticaria (ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes: 708.xx;
ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes: L50.0-L50.9) in the primary
diagnosis position or with >2 medical claims with distinct
service dates for urticaria in any position of the claims in
any setting. This approach was used because of the absence
of a specific ICD code for CIU and considering that study
patients were enrollees in Anthem health plans that required

 

prior authorization based on verification of CIU status before
approving omalizumab treatment. Study patients were aged
212 years on the index date; had >6 months of continuous
health plan eligibility immediately preceding the index date;
had
the index date; and were enrolled in a commercial or Medicare

12 months of continuous health plan eligibility following

Advantage health plan during the entire study period. Patients
with any claims for omalizumab in the pre-index period were

excluded.

Study Measures
Demographics.
health
patient geographic region were based on patient information

 

Demographic variables including age, gender,

 

 

plan type, Medicare Advantage Plan indicator, and

on the index date.

Clinical Characteristics. The clinical characteristics of inter
 

est for the 6-month pre-index (baseline) period and for the 2 or
3 post-index periods (i.e., 1- to 6-month, 7- to 12-month, and
13- to

follow-up]) included provider specialty and conditions such as

8-month follow-up [for patients with >18 months of

allergic rhinitis, anaphylaxis, conjunctivitis, eczema/dermatitis,

 

food allergy, angioedema, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, anxiety, depression, vasculitis, and allergic
purpura, which were identified by requiring at least 1 medical
claim with specific diagnosis codes of interest. Breakdown categories of urticaria based on ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes and
laboratory tests of interest were also evaluated.

Treatment Patterns. The use of medications was evaluated for
the baseline period and during the 2 or 3 post-index periods
(ie., 1 to 6-month, 7- to 12-month, and 13- to 18-month
follow-up [for patients with 218 months of follow-up]) for
first-, second-, and third-line therapies including prescription H1 and H2 antihistamines, montelukast, cyclosporine,
oral corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, and omalizumab.
For omalizumab, usage was reported for continuously treated
patients and for those who stopped omalizumab therapy
during the 6-, 12-, 18-month, and entire post-index periods
(maximum=754 days [~25 months]). The proportions of
patients who restarted after stopping the first course of treatment during the 6-, 12-, and 18-month periods were also
reported. Treatment discontinuation, only reported for the first
interruption after the index date, was defined as a gap of 290
days after treatment administration/fill, in accordance with
guidance from the study’s medical advisors and based on clinical experience. A sensitivity analysis using a gap of >60 days
was also conducted. The discontinuation date was defined as
the last date omalizumab was administered within the first
continuous therapy segment plus 1 day for medical claims or

600 Journal of Managed Care & Specialty Pharmacy JMCP july 2018

Vol. 24, No. 7

the last fill date plus days supply of the last fill for pharmacy
claims. Continuous omalizumab treatment (measured in days)
was defined as the time from the index date to the discontinuation date. For patients without treatment interruption,
the duration of continuous treatment was defined as the entire
post-index follow-up period. The restart date was defined as
the date of first omalizumab claim following a treatment discontinuation.

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics including means (standard deviation [SD])
‘or continuous variables and relative frequencies for categorical
variables were reported. An unadjusted analysis was conducted
or all comparisons between the 6-month pre-index period
and the 3 post-index periods. P values were estimated using
paired t-tests for normally distributed variables, Wilcoxon
signed-rank sum tests for non-normally distributed continuous variables, or McNemar tests (or Bowker’s test of symmetry
‘or square tables larger than 2 x 2) for categorical variables. The
Kaplan-Meier method was used to examine continuous omalizumab treatment until the first discontinuation or end of study
ollow-up, whichever occurred first. Omalizumab restart from
the first discontinuation date until the first restart date or end
of study follow-up, whichever occurred first, was also assessed
with the Kaplan-Meier method for the subset of patients who
discontinued omalizumab. All analyses were performed with
SAS Enterprise Guide 7.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC); a 2-sided
5% significance level was used for all statistical tests.

 

ls Results

Sample Size

Among 2,001 patients who initiated omalizumab within the
intake period, 1,026 patients had the diagnosis code for CIU.
Among these, a total of 408 patients had enrollment in only
commercial or Medicare Advantage plans during the study
period; had =>6 months pre-index and = 12 months post-index
continuous health plan enrollment; and were >12 years of
age as of index date. Among these 408 patients, 298 satisfied
the requirements for 24 omalizumab medical or pharmacy
claims within the first 6-month post-index period and had
212 months of health insurance eligibility, and 138 of the 298
patients had 218 months of health insurance eligibility.

 

Demographic Characteristics

Study patients had a mean (SD) age of 43.5 (13.64) years, and
70.8% were female. The subgroup of patients with > 18 months
were similar, with a mean (SD) age of 43.4 (14.00) years, with
70.3% female. The 40-64 years age group made up the largest
proportion of patients in both the full study population (60.4%)
and the subset (60.9%) of patients with > 18 months of followup, as shown in Table 1.

Pre- and Post-Index Clinical Characteristics

Provider Type. A majority of patients with > 12 months of follow-up were seen by allergists/immunologists in the 6-month
pre-index (83.6%), 6-month post-index (83.6%), and 7- to
12-month post-index (77.5%) periods. Across those periods,
5.7%, 4.4%, and 5.4% of patients were seen by dermatologists
and 2.3%, 1.3%, and 2.3% were seen by primary care physicians, respectively, as shown in Table 2. A similar pattern was
seen for patients with >18 months of follow-up as shown in
Appendix A (available in online article).

and continued over the longer follow-up time period as shown
in Appendix B (available in online article).

Omalizumab Utilization Patterns

Duration of Continuous Treatment. Overall, more than
70% of patients who started omalizumab treatment remained
on therapy for at least 1 year, with the majority staying on
for approximately 15 months. As the Kaplan-Meier analysis
showed, among 298 patients with 212 months of post-index
follow-up, the mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) number
of days of continuous treatment with omalizumab was 443.1
(425.0-461.3). The probabilities of patients receiving continuous treatment (95% CI) were 0.879 (0.836-0.911), 0.711 (0.6560.759), and 0.647 (0.585-0.703) for the 6-, 12-, and 18-month
post-index periods, respectively, as shown in Figure 2.
For patients with >18 months of post-index follow-up, the
mean (95% CI) number of days of continuous treatment with
omalizumab was 428.4 (400.5-456.4). The probability of continuous treatment (95% CI) within the 6-, 12-, and 18-month
post-index periods, respectively, was 0.855 (0.784-0.904),
0.674 (0.589-0.745), and 0.601 (0.515-0.678; data not shown).

CIU= chronic idiopathic urticaria.

 

Discontinuation. For patients with 212 months of post-index
follow-up, 12.1% (n=36), 28.5% (n=85), and 32.9% (n=98)
discontinued omalizumab within the 6-month, 12-month, and
the entire post-index periods (mean 530 days), respectively.
Among the patients with 218 months of post-index follow-up,
omalizumab was discontinued in 14.5% (n=20), 31.9%
(n=44), 39.9% (n=55), and 39.9% (n=55) of patients within
the 6-month, 12-month, 18-month, and the entire post-index
periods, respectively.

Restart. Among the 98 patients with >12 months of postindex follow-up who discontinued omalizumab within the
entire post-index period, 28.6% restarted omalizumab after
the first treatment interruption. Among 55 patients with 218
months of post-index follow-up who discontinued omalizumab
within the entire post-index period, 32.7% restarted omalizumab after the first treatment interruption. The Kaplan-Meier
analysis results for the 212-month follow-up cohort showed
that the mean (95% CI) number of days from first discontinuation to first restart was 328.8 (301.3-356.2) during the
entire post-index period and the probabilities of restart (95%
Cl) was 0.260 (0.182-0.363), 0.301 (0.216-0.409), and 0.334
(0.236-0.459) within the 6-, 12-, and 18-month periods since
first discontinuation, respectively, as shown in Figure 3. For

the >18-month follow-up cohort, the mean (95% CI) number
of days from first discontinuation to first restart was 320.5
(282.8-358.1) during the entire post-index period and the
probability of restart (95% CD were 0.301 (0.196-0.444), 0.321
(0.213-0.465), and 0.353 (0.237-0.505) within the 6-, 12-,
and 18-month periods since first discontinuation, respectively
(data not shown).

Sensitivity Analysis
The results from the sensitivity analysis regarding omalizumab
continuous treatment, discontinuation, and restart using a gap
of 260 days between omalizumab administrations/fills were
similar to the main analysis results (data not shown).

ll Discussion
Omalizumab has been prescribed to patients for over 15 years
and has been indicated for the management of CIU since
2014." Not unexpectedly, due to the short time since the
approval for the CIU indication, real-word data on the use of
omalizumab among these patients are sparse, and only the
results of a few short-term studies that evaluated small patient
samples are currently available.

This study presents real-world information on the demographic and clinical characteristics and treatment patterns
of CI1U patients initiating omalizumab treatment.’ The study
concentrated on results for patients who had >12 months
of follow-up data; results are also shown for a subgroup of
patients whose information was available for >18 months
after treatment initiation. The longer follow-up in the present
study adds information on treatment patterns in usual care
and complements evidence generated in the randomized controlled trials, which typically had follow-up periods that were
no longer than 6 months. These data with longer follow-up
can provide valuable information with regard to the real-world
duration of therapy that has been described as lacking in the
omalizumab package insert. One of the key new insights from
this study was that the probability of continuous treatment
was high across the post-index period: the mean duration of
continuous treatment for patients with >12 months of postindex follow-up was 443 days and 428 days for patients with
218 months of follow-up.

A handful of retrospective studies have evaluated the
use of omalizumab in usual care settings and reported on
response and discontinuation rates and reasons for discontinuation, continuous treatment, resolution of symptoms, and
time to relapse.**!"° In most cases the studies used relatively
small sample sizes, had short follow-up periods ranging from
8 weeks to 7 months,”!*?! or were performed outside the
United States. In one U.S.-based retrospective chart review
study, among CIU patients receiving omalizumab for more than
1 year, 10 patients were assessed to determine the effectiveness
of omalizumab, the feasibility of weaning patients off treatment,

and safety associated with refractory disease. The authors concluded that it was safe and effective for patients with refractive
CIU to receive omalizumab for more than 1 year but suggested
periodic weaning to allow for opportunities for spontaneous
remission.'* A research letter on one Danish study (N= 154)
reported that 56.2% of patients continued treatment | year after
treatment initiation?’ For these and other reasons, including
substantially different study designs and care settings, it is not
instructive to make comparisons with our findings, which are
based on a substantially longer follow-up duration. Har et al.
(2015), in a study (N = 10) that evaluated the effectiveness, safety,
and feasibility of weaning omalizumab, reported that patients
stayed on omalizumab therapy for 17-112 (median 27) months.'*

Of note in our study, most patients (approximately 84%)
were seen by allergists or immunologists, while only a small
proportion (~6%) were seen by dermatologists. This information is not well characterized in the handful of retrospective
studies in the literature. These studies did not report provider
specialities and were largely conducted with convenience samples, often of specific patients in a single clinical practice,*!*!°?!
unlike our study, which sampled a large spectrum of commercially insured and Medicare Advantage patients.

CIU patients initiating treatment with omalizumab used
significantly fewer other related medications in the post-index
period relative to the baseline pre-index period. Most noteworthy is that oral corticosteroid use decreased by more than half
from the baseline period to 1 year after starting omalizumab.
This could be considered as a proxy for a decrease in CIU
symptoms after omalizumab. Similar decreases were observed
for montelukast and prescription H1 and H2 antihistamines.
This is beneficial to CIU patients, since it decreases their medication burden and limits the long-term risks of adverse effects
associated with medications such as oral corticosteroids.

Overall, almost three quarters of patients continued omalizumab therapy within the 12-month post-index period during the main analyses and approximately 60% within the
18-month post-index period among the subset of patients
with 218 months of follow-up. Among patients with first
omalizumab discontinuation, less than one third of patients
restarted omalizumab treatment after their first discontinuation during the entire post-index period. The time between
discontinuation and restart was almost a year (329 days) for
patients who were re-treated. As CIU is a condition that commonly reappears and omalizumab is not a remittive therapy,
recurrence was not unexpected. While clinical studies also
report discontinuation rates,'*'°** our results add to these data
captured in the controlled settings of clinical trials. However,
administrative claims data do not provide reasons why patients
discontinue their treatment, although the range of possibilities
may include treatment efficacy, disease remission, or intolerance due to adverse effects.

Limitations

As with any study, limitations with regard to data source and
study design should be taken into account when interpreting
the results. The presence of a diagnosis code on a medical
claim is not a guarantee of the presence of the disease of interest. Coding could be erroneously applied or used as a ruleout criterion. In particular with CIU, no classification option
is available for defining chronicity of idiopathic urticaria in
ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes. Since all urticaria
diagnosis codes were used for the identification of ClU
patients, some study patients could have been misclassified
as CIU patients. This was likely mitigated, however, by prior
authorization models in the health plans that require the presence of CIU before omalizumab was prescribed. In addition,
a significant number of patients had a concomitant diagnosis
of asthma, so we cannot definitely determine the indication
for administration of omalizumab in these patients. Over-thecounter medications or provider samples are not captured in
the claims data, so medication use could have been underestimated, which is especially relevant when evaluating our
reported use of H1] and H2 antihistamines, as only prescription
use could be captured. Dosing information for omalizumab
was unavailable in the claims data. Since only patients treated
with >4 claims for omalizumab within 6 months after initiation were included, the study sample was likely different from
populations with <4 claims for omalizumab. We chose this

 

selection criteria to ensure that we evaluated only patients
who were provided omalizumab therapy that was sufficient
for a meaningful determination of effect. Study patients were
identified within administrative claims in one large U.S.based repository and consisted of commercial and Medicare
Advantage health plan enrollees, potentially limiting the generalizability of these results across different populations.

 

lS Conclusions

In this cohort of C1U patients who were prescribed omalizumab
therapy, the majority of patients were treated by allergists/
immunologists, and approximately 60% of patients persisted
on omalizumab treatment for at least 18 months. Concomitant

 

medication use decreased after omalizumab initiation. As these
are among the first data available from the real-world use of
omalizumab for CIU, this information may help providers as
they develop their treatment plans and provide expectations
on the treatment course, as well as to better inform decisionmaking processes for health care payers.
