Background: Though autoimmune phenomena have been regularly associated with chronic urticaria

in adults, data in children are sparse.

Aim: To describe our experience with children and adolescents with chronic urticaria and autoimmu
nity.

Methods and Results: Of 187 patients referred for evaluation of chronic urticaria during a 7.5 year
period, eight (4.3%), all females aged 7-17 years, had increased levels of antithyroid antibody, either

cases the causative factors are identified and include mainly
infections or physical stimuli.'* Autoimmune thyroid disease

We describe our experience with children and adolescents
with chronic urticaria and associated autoimmunity.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
From January 1994 to June 2001, 187 children and
adolescents (age range 6-18 years; male:female ratio 0.92)
were referred to the allergy clinic for evaluation of chronic
urticaria (=6 weeks duration). Each patient underwent complete clinical history and physical examination. The work up
for chronic urticaria included the following: (1) blood tests for
complete blood count, sedimentation rate, blood chemistry,
hepatitis B surface antigen, antibody titres for hepatitis B
virus, herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and mycoplasma, antistreptolysin antibody, antinuclear
antibody (ANA) and anti-DNA antibody if needed, levels of
serum complement components C3 and C4, free thyroxine
(normal range 10.5-25.7 pmol/l), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) (normal range 0.4—4 mIU/1), antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies (normal <75 IU/ml), antithyroglobulin antibodies (normal <150 IU/ml), and anti-islet cell
antibodies in patients with a family history of type 1 diabetes;
(2) urine analysis and culture, nasal and throat swabs; (3)
chest and sinus x rays; (4) prick skin tests with food allergens;
and (5) ice cube test for cold induced urticaria and skin stroking for dermatographism. Follow up of the patients included

C ildhood chronic urticaria is a common disorder

 

 

Conclusion: Children with chronic urticaria should be screened periodically for thyroxine, TSH, and
antithyroid antibodies, as thyroid autoimmunity and hypothyroidism may appear several years after

antithyroid peroxidase antibody (n = 4, >75 IU/ml), antithyroglobulin antibody (n = 2, >150 IU/ml),
or both (n = 2). The duration of urticaria was four months to seven years. Five patients were euthyroid,
one of whom was found to have increased antithyroid antibody levels five years after onset of the urticaria. One patient was diagnosed with Hashimoto thyroiditis three years before the urticaria, and was
receiving treatment with thyroxine. Two other hypothyroid patients were diagnosed during the initia
work up for urticaria (thyroxine 9.2 pmol/l, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 40.2 mlU/I) and five
years after onset of the urticaria (thyroxine 14 pmol/I, TSH 10.3 mlU/I). Both were treated with thyroxine but neither had remission of the urticaria. Five patients had a low positive titre of antinuclear anti
periodic visits and blood tests for free thyroxine, TSH, an
antithyroid antibodies. The antithyroid antibody levels were
measured using immunometric enzyme immunoassay (Orgentec Diagnostika GmbH, Mainz, Germany). Thyroxine an
TSH levels were measured by a solid phase competitive
analogue sequential chemiluminescent immunoassay (Immulite 2000, DPC, Los Angeles, CA).
All patients were treated with H, receptor blocking
medication (loratadine, cetirizine). Short courses of ora!
corticosteroids were reserved for severe exacerbations.

 

 

RESULTS

Only eight of the 187 patients evaluated had increased levels
of antithyroid antibodies, and these constituted the study
sample. The results of their work ups for food allergy or physical or infectious causes were negative. Tables 1 and 2 present
the pertinent patient data.

In four patients (nos 1, 2, 4, 6), family history was positive
for autoimmune and endocrinological diseases (juvenile
rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, Hashimoto thyroiditis,
and hypothyroidism). Patient 1 was found to have Hashimoto
thyroiditis during the work up for chronic urticaria, and treatment with thyroxine (100 «g/day) was started immediately. In
patient 6, a diagnosis of Hashimoto thyroiditis had been made
three years prior to onset of the chronic urticaria; she was
being treated with thyroxine 100 «g daily. Her pretreatment
thyroxine and TSH levels were 9.3 pmol/l and 1.4 mIU/ml,
respectively (data not shown). Treatment with thyroxine was
initiated mainly because of findings of nodular goitre.

Patients 4 and 5, both with chronic urticaria of six and
seven years duration, respectively, had increased levels of
antithyroid antibodies five years after onset of the urticaria.

of type 1 diabetes and increased levels of antighutamic acid
decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies (55.2 units, normal <6.5),no
evidence of insulin autoantibodies and islet cell antibodies,
and a normal oral glucose tolerance test. Five patients had
positive low ANA titres (1/40-1/160), with negative findings
for anti-DNA antibodies in the three patients who were tested.
C3 levels were mildly reduced in two patients.

None of the three patients treated with thyroxine had a
remission of the urticaria.

None of the other 179 patients with chronic urticaria was
hypothyroid or had a positive test for ANA.

DISCUSSION

Most cases of chronic urticaria in children are idiopathic.
Physical stimuli, infections, and stress comprise the majority
of identified causative factors.'*

The association of chronic urticaria with autoimmune thyroid disease has frequently been reported in adults. The prevalence in adult series ranges from 14% to 33%.*”

The prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity in our study was
4.3%, much lower than that in adult series of chronic urticaria,
but higher than the prevalence reported to date for age
matched children: in two population based studies of the
10-11 to 18 year age group, Rallison and colleagues" reported
a 1.27% prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis in 4819
children, and Marwaha and colleagues" found a prevalence of
1.6% in 6283 girls. Jaksic and colleagues’ found a prevalence
of 0.35% in 5462 school age children.

Although 90 of our entire group of 187 children and adolescents with chronic urticaria were males, all the patients with
chronic urticaria and thyroid autoimmunity were females.

This is in accordance with findings of a higher prevalence of
thyroid autoimmunity in women in cross sectional studies."
Other investigators also showed that the association of chronic
urticaria with thyroid autoimmunity is more common in
females.””

Our literature review yielded no large series of thyroid
autoimmunity in chronic urticaria in children, although
several case reports have been published. Dreyfus and
colleagues* described a 9 year old boy with chronic urticaria
and antithyroid microsomal antibodies who had prolonged
remission with thyroxine treatment. Levine and colleagues"
reported an 11 year old girl who had chronic urticaria with
antithyroid antibodies, who was also found to have coeliac
disease. Her family history revealed chronic urticaria and thyroid autoimmunity in three generations on the maternal side.
In another report of two children, aged 15 and 13 years, with
chronic urticaria, one child also had type 1 diabetes, increased
levels of antithyroglobulin antibodies, and low titre of ANA;
the other later developed systemic type juvenile rheumatoid
arthritis. He also had a positive family history of autoimmune
disorders, such as thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes, and coeliac
disease.”

Similar to the patients reported by Levine and colleagues'*
and Dalal and colleagues,” four of our patients had a positive
family history of autoimmune diseases, and five had positive
titres of ANA, with low C3 levels in two. However, none, except
patient 4, had any clinical or laboratory evidence of
autoimmune disease other than the thyroid autoimmunity.
Patient 4, whose brother had type 1 diabetes, also had
increased levels of anti-GAD antibodies, but repeated oral glucose tolerance tests during the subsequent two years of follow
up were consistently normal. It is known that type 1 diabetes
may coexist with other endocrine diseases and that organ

specific antibodies are a frequent occurrence in these
patients.'* Jaeger and colleagues” found that type 1 diabetes
associated antibodies and antithyroid antibodies were significantly more frequent in first degree relatives of patient with
type 1 diabetes than in healthy controls.

Three of our patients (nos 1, 5, 6) were hypothyroid. Patient
1 was diagnosed during the work up for chronic urticaria;
patient 6, three years prior to the appearance of the urticaria;
and patient 5, five years after the appearance of the urticaria.
In one additional patient (no. 4), antithyroid antibodies were
detected only five years after the appearance of the urticaria.
These findings may indicate that the thyroid autoimmunity in
chronic urticaria is an evolving process and may be manifested
before, concomitant with, or several years after the appearance
of the urticaria. They may also explain the low prevalence of
thyroid autoimmunity in our series compared to adults:
adolescent patients with chronic urticaria may be diagnosed
with thyroid autoimmunity only as young adults.

The mechanism whereby thyroid autoimmunity is associated with urticaria is poorly understood. The antithyroid IgG
antibodies may not be directly involved in the mast cell
degranulation and pathogenesis of the chronic urticaria, but
only serve as indicators of autoimmunity.’ Skin biopsy
specimens from patients with chronic urticaria, with or without Hashimoto thyroiditis, were indistinguishable by light
microscopy, and no immune complex deposition was
observed.” Several researchers have observed serum histamine releasing activity in a subgroup of adult patients with
chronic urticaria which was attributable to an IgG autoantibody directed against the alpha chain of the high affinity IgE
receptor (FceRI ) of the mast cells or, less commonly, against
IgE itself.’ '° In addition, clustering of thyroid antimicrosomal
antibodies was found in patients with a positive autologous
serum test, indicating the presence of functional histamine
releasing autoantibodies.” In a series of patients with chronic
urticaria only patients with chronic urticaria and Hashimoto
thyroiditis had anti-Fce RI antibodies in their sera that could
induce degranulation of normal basophils.” These antibodies
have not been investigated systematically in children with
chronic urticaria. Greaves' found that three of seven tested
patients aged 13-16 years had functional anti-FceRI antibodies.

None of the three hypothyroid patients treated with
thyroxine had a remission of the urticaria, in contrast to the 9
year old euthyroid patient reported by Dreyfus and
colleagues,’ and the euthyroid and hypothyroid patients in the
series of Rumbyrt and colleagues” and Gaig and colleagues.”
Moreover, patient 6 developed urticaria while on treatment
with thyroxine (table 2). Although we have treated only
hypothyroid children, our experience does not support the use
of thyroxine treatment in euthyroid patients with chronic
urticaria.

Euthyroid patients with a positive anti-TPO antibody, have
an appreciable risk of progression to hypothyroidism."* Annual
reassessment of thyroid function in patients with chronic
urticaria and increased antithyroid titres is recommended.”
However, our experience shows that the thyroid autoimmunity may appear several years after the onset of chronic
urticaria, emphasising the importance of follow up and
periodic blood tests for thyroxine/TSH and antithyroid
antibodies in children with chronic urticaria. Whether
children and adolescents with chronic urticaria and thyroid
autoimmunity belong to the subgroup of chronic urticaria
patients with autoimmune mast cell disease is still to be
determined.
