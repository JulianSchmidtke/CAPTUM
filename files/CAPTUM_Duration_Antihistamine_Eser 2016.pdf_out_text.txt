KEYWORDS Abstract

Chronic urticaria; Background: There are few studies in children on the natural course of chronic spontaneous

Remission; urticaria (CSU) because of its relative infrequency in childhood.

Predictive factors Objective: To estimate the rate of remission and evaluate the prognostic factors in children
with CSU.
Method: A total of 52 children with CSU were prospectively followed over a period of three
years.

Results: The remission rates at 12 months and 36 months were 32.7% and 48.1%. The mean
duration of disease at the first visit in the non-remission group was higher than in the remission
group at the end of the study (P=0.016). The remission rate of the patients who had been
treated by standard dose antihistamine was higher than that of the patients who had been
treated with the high-dose antihistamine and combination medications (P=0.004, P< 0.001).
The treatment steps were independent prognostic factors for remission by logistic regression
analysis.

Conclusion: Our study indicates that urticaria controlled by a standard dose of antihistamine
can predict a good prognosis independently from disease duration at first visit.

or other cause is identified. Although accurate data on the
prevalence of CSU are unavailable in children, this condition
is thought to affect 0.1-3% of adults in the United States
and Europe.! The presence of histamine-releasing IgG antiFcRI and anti-IgE autoantibodies suggests an autoimmune
pathogenesis of disease in a subset of patients; 31-47% of
children with CSU have an autoimmune cause with a positive
autologous serum skin test (ASST).°~?

CSU is an unpredictable disease. There is limited literature regarding the prognosis of CSU, and most relates to
adults. '°-'? Only a few studies on the natural course of the
disease have been performed on children.®®'?)'4 Although
some studies on adults have suggested that a positive ASST
result, the presence of angio-oedema and positive antithyroid antibodies might indicate a long disease duration,
we still know little about the association between the natural course and the clinical/laboratory parameters of CSU in
children. '!

The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the
natural course and prognostic variables of CSU in childhood.

Methods

The study was performed in the Department of Paediatric
Allergy and Immunology at Kocaeli University, Turkey, from
January 2012 to January 2015. The study included children
with urticaria present daily or almost daily for duration o
at least 6 weeks.

At the screening visits, all patients underwent a detailed
history, and physical examination. In all instances, personal history of atopic diseases (such as atopic dermatitis,
asthma, allergic rhinitis), any drug intake, presence o
associated angio-oedema, signs of infection (such as upper
airway infection, urinary tract infection, fever), signs o
connective tissue disease and auto-inflammatory syndromes
(such as arthritis, arthralgia, fever, conjunctivitis, muscle
and skin tenderness after exposure to cold, sensorineura
hearing loss), trigger of urticaria (such as cold, exercise,
hot shower), and recent travel history were investigated.
In addition, family history of urticaria, atopic disease and
autoimmune conditions were recorded. Skin prick tests with
commercial allergens (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus,
Dermatophagoides farina, grass, tree and weed pollens,
Alternaria, Penicillium and Aspergillus, dog and cat epithelia, milk, egg, soy, peanut, hazelnut, fish, wheat) and
provocation tests for physical urticaria were performed on
patients with a suggestive history.

To investigate the known causes of CU, the patients
underwent the following laboratory workup: (i) complete
blood cell count, blood chemistry, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, liver function tests; (ii) infective panel
(serologic assays for hepatitis A and B virus, Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), urine analysis and
culture, throat culture, H. pylori |gG antibodies and three
stool examinations for parasites); (iii) autoimmune panel
(anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TG)
antibody, anti-thyroperoxidase (anti-TPO) antibody, free T4,
thyroid-stimulating hormone).

At the first visit, the patients without a clearly defined
cause were enrolled based on exclusion criteria that
included isolated physical urticaria, atopic dermatitis,

 

infectious diseases, connective tissue diseases, autoinflammatory syndromes and food hypersensitivity. Informed
consent was obtained from the parents. ASSTs were performed on all patients. The patients were followed up every
four weeks. After follow-up at least one year, the patients
were allowed to leave the study if they had been in remission.

Autologous serum skin test

The patients discontinued short-acting antihistamines for at
least three days. Briefly, 0.05 ml of sterile, fresh, undiluted
autologous serum or 0.9% sterile saline as a negative control
was injected intradermally into the volar aspect. A skin prick
test with histamine (10 .g/ml) was used as a positive control. Wheal and flare reactions were recorded after 30 min.
An ASST was considered positive when the wheal diameter
was 1.5mm or greater compared with that elicited by saline.

Urticaria activity score

Disease activity was assessed with an urticaria activity score
(UAS). Daily assessments for key urticarial symptoms were
recorded by the patients, or parents if patients were young,
wheal number (range 0-3) and pruritus intensity (range
0-3), which were added together (range 0-6). The UAS7 is
the sum of the scores from seven consecutive days (maximum 0-42).

Treatment

The second-generation H1-antihistamine at the standard
dose for age was initiated in the patients who did not receive
the H1-antihistamine treatment (step 1). The dose increased
up to fourfold if urticaria was not controlled (step 2). If
urticaria was not controlled, combination therapy was used
including high-dose antihistamine plus montelukast and/or
ranitidine (step 3). The dose increased or combined with
montelukast and/or ranitidine for patients treated with the
second-generation H1-antihistamines already at the referral
time. Remission was considered if symptoms did not recur
for at least three months without drugs.

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS
for Windows version 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used to test the normality
of data distribution. Continuous variables were expressed as
means + standard deviation or median (interquartile range),
and categorical variables were expressed as counts (percentages). Comparisons of continuous variables between
the groups were performed using the Student t test and
the Mann-Whitney U test. Comparisons of categorical variables between the groups were performed using the Pearson,
Fisher, Yates, Monte Carlo x? test. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the independent association between
the factors that differed significantly in the remission and
non-remission groups based on univariate analysis. A twosided P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Demographic data

Among 60 patients screened, five patients were lost to
follow-up within the first year, and three patients were
excluded from the study because they had poor drug compliance. The 52 patients were followed up for at least one
year. Demographic and clinical features of the patients are
shown in Table 1. The ASST gave a positive result in 23 of
52 children (44.2%) with CSU. There was no difference in
the demographic data, laboratory investigations and UAS
between ASST-positive and ASST-negative patients. In all, six
children (11.5%) had positive anti-thyroid antibodies (four
patients (7.7%) anti-TPO and two patients (3.8%) anti-TG)
and ten (19.2%) patients had positive ANA titres. No patients
had abnormal thyroid function test results. Seven patients
(13.5%) had atopic diseases (asthma 9.6%, allergic rhinitis
3.9%) and eight children (15.4%) had family history of allergic
disease. No patients had family history of chronic urticaria.

Remission rates and prognostic factors

The remission rate was 32.7% (n:17) at one year of their
follow-up in the 52 patients. The cumulative remission rate
was 46.1% at three years (at the end of study). The clinical
and laboratory profiles of the remission and non-remission
groups at the end of study are summarised in Table 2. The

in the non-remission group and there were no significant
differences in terms of age, gender, UAS, ASST positivity and
the presence of dermographism and/or angio-oedema.

We found that the duration of disease at the first visit
in the non-remission group was higher than that in the
remission group (P=0.016). In all, 11 patients (21.2%) and
26 patients (50%) were prescribed standard and high-dose
antihistamine. Fifteen patients (28.8%) were prescribed
combination medications. The remission rate at three years
in patients who were taking only standard dose antihistamine was higher than in those taking high-dose antihistamine and combination medications for control of urticaria
(standard dose-high-dose antihistamine, P= 0.004; standard
dose antihistamine-combination therapy, P<0.001). Logistic regression analysis, which included disease duration at
first visit and medication usage, showed that treatment
steps were independent prognostic factors of remission
(standard dose antihistamine-high-dose antihistamine: odds
ratio (OR), 0.134; 95% confidence interval (Cl), 0.021-0.869;
P=0.035, standard dose antihistamine-combination therapy: OR, 0.106; 95% Cl, 0.014-0.788; P=0.028). A
Kaplan-Meier curve was produced to determine the remission rate for the treatment groups (Fig. 1).

There were no differences in remission rates and medication requirements between ASST-positive and ASST-negative
patients.

The association between the clinical/laboratory parameters and UAS7 was analysed. Anti-TPO-positive patients had
higher urticaria scores compared with patients without antibody (P=0.018). The presence of dermographism and/or
angio-oedema, ASST positivity and ANA did not influence the
UAS.

Discussion

The early identification of prognostic factors that can predict the course of the disease is desirable because CSU
is a long-term disease and is a challenge for the patient
and the doctor in most cases. In our prospective study, we
investigated the remission rate and several parameters as
predictors of the natural course in children with CSU.

The remission rates in this study were 32.7% and 46.1% at
one and three years, respectively. The remission rate at one
year was much higher than has been reported previously.
Sahiner et al.® reported remission from urticaria in 16.5% of
children after one year. After three years, 38.8% of the children were urticaria free and after five years, it had resolved
in half of the cases. Chansakulporn et al. '4 found that 18.5%,
54% and 67.5% of patients were in remission at one, three,
and five years from the onset of symptoms, respectively.

Previous studies on adult populations demonstrated that
the remission rate decreases as urticaria persists.'°'> In
our study, the median duration of urticaria before inclusion
was 4.5 months (range, 2-60 months), and the patients had
short disease duration compared with those in a paediatric
study reported by Chansakulporn et al.'4 (2.7 years; range,
0.3-11.3 years). This factor may account for the high remission rate at one year. Although on univariate analysis the
mean duration of urticaria before inclusion and the treatment steps in the remission and non-remission groups were
significantly different in our study, no statistically significantly differences were found in disease duration by logistic
regression analysis.

The remission rate of the patients who had taken
standard dose antihistamine was higher than that of patients
who had been treated with high-dose antihistamine or combination medications in logistic regression analysis. There
were no significant differences in UAS between the remission and non-remission groups. In this study, we clarified
that the response to standard dose antihistamine was an
important prognostic factor for remission regardless of the
activity of urticaria and the disease duration at first visit.
This is consistent with a previous report by Hiragun et al.'*

Although adult studies have emphasised that a positive
ASST result might indicate increased disease activity and/or
long disease duration, '®'® our study showed no significant
difference between children who were ASST positive and
ASST negative with regard to clinical future, UAS and medication usage. ASST-positive patients also had the same
remission rate as ASST-negative patients. A positive ASST

response to medications, but patients with positive antiTPO had significantly higher chronic activity scores at first
visit than patients with negative anti-TPO. Caminiti et al.*!
hypothesised that children with active chronic urticaria may
have associated autoimmune conditions more frequently.
This result suggests that children with higher disease activity
may have anti-TPO antibodies more frequently; a long-term
follow-up would be important, to identify any association
between CSU and autoimmune thyroid disease in children
because autoimmune diseases develop over several years.

The small sample size is a limitation of our study. When
considering the low prevalence of CU in childhood, it seems
difficult to reach a sufficient size of sample in a single
centre. Although three patients were excluded from the
present study because of poor compliance, patients’ compliance to the treatment was not evaluated in detail, which
could be considered another limitation. Further multicentre, prospective studies which contain a larger sample size
and evaluation of treatment compliance based on objective
measures are still needed.

In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the prognosis of CSU is generally favourable in childhood and in most
patients with CSU, standard or high-dose antihistamines
often resolve symptoms. In patients with longer disease
duration at first visit, urticaria that was controlled by a
standard dose of antihistamine could predict if the CSU
had a good prognosis. This finding may help to increase
patient compliance with treatment. Thus, further studies
about treatment response and the natural course of CSU in
childhood should be performed.
