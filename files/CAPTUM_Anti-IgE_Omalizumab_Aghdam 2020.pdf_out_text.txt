Abstract

Background: The pathogenesis of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and the
mechanism of action of omalizumab in CSU remain unclear.

Objective: In this study, we assessed the responsiveness and FceRI expression of
various subsets of leucocytes in patients with CSU treated with omalizumab.
Methods: In this prospective cohort study, 30 patients were treated with 6 administrations of 300 mg omalizumab every 4 weeks, followed by a follow-up period of
12 weeks. FceRI expression and the percentage of basophils, monocytes, and dendritic cell subsets were analysed before and during treatment, and after follow-up.
In addition, anti-lgE- and C5a-induced basophil degranulation was measured. The
results were correlated with disease activity and response to omalizumab.

Results: In addition to a rapid and significant reduction in FceRI on basophils, we demonstrated a reduction in FceRI on plasmacytoid dendritic cells during omalizumab
treatment, which persisted until 3 months after discontinuation. FceRI expression on
basophils and its reduction did not correlate with the treatment response. Omalizumab
led to an increased percentage of basophils in blood but not of the other FceRI-bearing
leucocytes. Basophil responsiveness was differentially affected; anti-lgE-, but not
C5a-induced basophil degranulation increased during the treatment. Apart from clinical non-responders showing a stronger increase in anti-lgE-induced basophil degranulation over a period time, no differences were found in omalizumab responders vs
non-responders.

Conclusions/Clinical Relevance: FceRI expression on basophils decreased rapidly,
while anti-lgE-induced degranulation significantly increased due to omalizumab
treatment in patients with CSU, persisting at least for 3 months after stopping the
treatment. None of the markers were able to predict the effectiveness of treatment. Whether basophils play a role in omalizumab responsiveness in CSU remains

unclear.

1 | INTRODUCTION

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) manifests as a skin disease
with a sudden onset of weals, which last longer than 6 weeks. The
disease duration ranges from 1 to 5 years or even longer in more
severe cases.! Omalizumab is effective as a third-line treatment in
a majority of CSU patients with insufficient response to a fourfold
dose of antihistamines.” It is administered subcutaneously and
reaches peak serum concentrations after an average of 7-8 days.
Clearance of the monoclonal antibody is slow, with a terminal
half-life of 19-22 days,* which allows for relatively long treatment
intervals of 4 weeks. A rapid clinical response can be seen ina
proportion of the patients after the first omalizumab dose administration; however, other patients require multiple doses to reach
a well-controlled disease status.°

Omalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, which
binds to the Ce3 domain of free IgE, thereby preventing it from
binding to Fc epsilon RI (FceRI).° Depletion of free IgE by omalizumab leads to a down-regulation of the FceRI on mast cells ina
majority of patients.”® Mast cells are considered to be the most
important effector cells in CSU. In addition, a role for basophils
has been suggested in certain urticaria phenotypes.’ Basophil
numbers are inversely related to urticaria severity.°** An increased presence of basophils in the skin and decreased numbers
in peripheral blood suggest that basophils are recruited to the
affected skin sites.1? 4

Recent studies investigating the response of skin mast cells to
omalizumab in allergic patients showed down-regulation of FceRI
expression after 1-2 months.'*?” Therefore, other cell types, such
as basophils and dendritic cells, might account for the rapid clinical
effect of omalizumab.'*”

Decreased degranulation of basophils after stimulation via
FceRI was demonstrated in patients with urticaria compared to that
in healthy controls.?° It is not known if responses to other stimuli, such as C5a (which activates basophils via a G-protein-coupled
pathway), are affected.7° Besides basophils and mast cells, other
myeloid cells can also express FceRI on their surfaces.2? The presence of FceRI has been demonstrated on monocytes and different
types of dendritic cells, more profoundly in patients with allergies
than in healthy individuals. In allergic rhinitis patients, expression
of FceRI on the different myeloid cells depended on serum IgE concentration, and treatment with omalizumab reduced the expression
of FceRI on basophils, mast cells, and DCs.2244 Recently, Deza et al
suggested that the baseline expression of basophil FceRI was a potential immunological predictor of responsiveness to omalizumab in
urticaria. Furthermore, they found that patients who responded to
omalizumab treatment had a rapid reduction in the levels of basophil

FceRI during treatment. Given the potential role of FceRI-bearing

leucocytes, in particular basophils, in the pathogenesis and/or
treatment response to omalizumab, we evaluated the role of FceRI
bearing cells in CSU patients treated with omalizumab.

2 | METHODS
2.1 | Design and population

This monocentric exploratory prospective cohort study was performed in the University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands,
from 2015 until 2017. We included 30 patients according to the
following criteria: age 2 18 years, active diagnosis of CSU (weekly
urticaria activity score [UAS7]) 2 16, in-clinic UAS 2 4 on the day
of the first omalizumab administration, and insufficient response
to a four-times daily administration of antihistamines. Exclusion
criteria were clearly defined underlying aetiology for chronic urticaria (eg chronic inducible urticaria [CINDU]), a history of malignancy, known hypersensitivity to omalizumab, and pregnancy.
Routine administration of immunosuppressants, including prednisolone and cyclosporine A (CsA) was discontinued with washout
periods of 3 months prior to treatment with omalizumab. If prednisolone was used as a rescue medication, a washout period of
2 weeks was maintained.

After a screening period of up to 2 weeks, eligible patients received six doses of 300 mg omalizumab every 4 weeks. After the last
omalizumab administration, the patients were observed during a follow-up period of 3 months. The patients were kept on a treatment
with fourfold dose of H1 antihistamines throughout the study period.
Asarescue medication, patients were allowed to use prednisolone, up
to 30 mg daily. All other CSU-related medications were discontinued.

Disease activity was measured throughout the study using
the UAS7.2° Treatment response is defined as a UAS < 6 at
week 24 of treatment. Improvement by a minimal important difference (MID) is defined as a reduction in 10 UAS7 points.”¢ Alll the
patients provided written informed consent, and the study was

approved by the local ethics committee (protocol number 15-167).

2.2 | Blood collection

Blood samples were collected at the following time-points: at
baseline (TO) and at different time-points after the first injection:
6 hours (TO.25), 1 day (T1), 1 week (T7), 2 weeks (T14), 1 month
(second dose, T28), 1 month and 2 hours (T28.08), 2 months (T56),
3 months (T84), 4 months (T112), 5 months (T140) and 8 months
(follow-up, T224). EDTA blood and gel-separated serum were

placed on ice immediately after venipuncture. Blood was also

collected from nine self-reported healthy controls for baseline
analysis. All serum samples were allowed to coagulate for 60 minutes. Serum and plasma were obtained by centrifugation and
stored at -80°C. Total IgE was determined using the ImmunoCap
assay according the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher
Scientific).

2.3 | Leucocyte subset determination

Leucocytes subsets were identified using an antibody panel containing CD45-PO (Life Technologies) for lymphocytes; CD123PerCPCy5.5 (BD Pharmingen), CD203c APC (Sony), HLA-DR-PB
(Sony), and CD41-PE-Cy7 for basophils; and CD45-PO (Life
Technologies) and CD14-APC-H7 (BD Pharmingen) for monocytes.
To distinguish between the three different subsets of dendritic cells
(DCs), an antibody panel containing HLA-DR-PE-CY7 (BioLegend),
CD11c-PB (BioLegend), and CD123 PerCP Cy5.5 (BD Pharmingen)
was used for plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). For two subsets of
myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), CD14-V500 (BD), HLA-DR-PE-CY7
(BioLegend), CD1c-APC-Cy7 (BioLegend), and CD141-APC (Miltenyi)
were used. Leucocyte subset quantities were depicted as the per
centage of cells within the total leucocyte measures/numbers.

2.4 | Quantification of FceRI expression

Whole blood samples were divided into aliquots of 75 uL each to
carry out staining of basophils, monocytes, dendritic cells (DC), or an
isotype control. All the cells were stained for either FceRI (CRA-1, eBioscience) or an |gG2b isotype control (Sony) for 30 minutes at 4°C in
the dark. Following washing, cells and QIFIKIT beads (Dako, Glostrup,
Denmark) were simultaneously stained with a saturated solution of
goat anti-mouse IgG FITC to determine the absolute FceRI expression, quantified as antibody binding capacity (ABC). The QUIFIKIT
contains five bead populations with a distinct and known amount of
monoclonal mouse antibody bound per microsphere bead. By constructing a calibration curve based on the fluorescence intensity of
different populations plotted against their known antibody density,
FceRI expression on different cell types can be interpolated based on
their mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). The specific antibody binding capacity (SABC) is then calculated by subtracting the calculated
ABC for corresponding isotype controls from the anti-FceRI ABC.

2.5 | Basophil activation test

Heparin anti-coagulated blood samples were stimulated for 30 minutes at 37°C with increasing concentrations of anti-IgE (0.03, 0.1,
0.3, and 1 ug/mL) (Vector laboratories) or C5a (83 and 200 ng/mL)
(R&D Systems) in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, Life Technologies) containing 1 ng/mL IL3 (R&D Systems). Leucocytes were stained with
an antibody cocktail of CD45-PO (Life Technologies), CD123-FITC

(BioLegend), HLA-DR-PB (Sony), CD63-PE (Monosan), CD41 PECY7 (Beckman Coulter), or CD203c-APC (Sony). Basophils were
defined as CD45* CD203c* CD123* and HLA-DR CD41. Basophil
degranulation was quantified by determining the percentage of
CD63-binding basophils. The threshold for basophil degranulation

was set between degranulated and resting basophils.

2.6 | Statistical analysis

Differences in cell counts, basophil activation test (BAT) results, and
FceRI density in time were analysed using Wilcoxon matched-pairs
signed-rank tests. Analyses between different responder groups were
performed using Mann-Whitney U tests. Correlation analysis was performed using Spearman's rank correlation or Pearson's correlation if
appropriate. Regarding the UAS7 score, the difference between each
time-point and baseline was tested using Wilcoxon matched-pairs
signed-rank tests. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS
Statistics version 21 or GraphPad Prism version 7.02. Graphs were
plotted using Microsoft Visio 2010 or GraphPad Prism version 7.02.

with a median UAS7 score at baseline of 31.5 points were enrolled in

the study. Patient characteristics (Table S1) corresponded with the
CSU population in our clinic and current studies in literature.?”

Figure 1 shows the weekly median values of UAS7; the patients
were differentiated into omalizumab responders and non-responders.
Fifteen patients (50%) showed a UAS7 score of six or lower (median
O) at 4 weeks after the last omalizumab administration (24 weeks) and
were defined as responders. Fourteen patients showed a UAS7 score
of seven or higher (median 16) at week 24 and were defined as non-responders. The UAS7 score of one patient was missing at week 24 and
was marked as non-responder based on the last known UAS7 score.

Improvement by a minimal important difference (MID) of 10
UAS7 points at week 24 was observed in 23 patients (76.6%), which
included nine complete responders (UAS7 = 0). Due to worsening of
the disease, 11 patients, of which 6 (55%) were presented as responders, restarted omalizumab treatment during follow-up. Subjects who
restarted omalizumab during the follow-up period were excluded
from the follow-up data analysis. In absolute numbers, the number
of patients who were excluded was 1 in week 25, 2 in week 26, 3 in
week 28, 4 in week 29, 9 in week 30, and 11 in week 32.

3.2 | FceRI expression on basophils, pDCs and mDC
CD1cs decreases during treatment

In peripheral blood, we determined FceRI expression on basophils,
monocytes, pDCs, and two subsets of mDCs (mDC CD141 and
mDC CD1c) at specific time-points before, during, and after treatment. A large and significant difference in FceRI expression on
basophils was found at T7 (P < .0001) and all other time-points, including after 3-month follow-up (T224) compared to that at baseline (TO) (Figure 2). Reduction in FceRI expression did not differ
significantly between responder and non-responder groups. The
decline in FceRI expression showed a weak correlation with the
decline in UAS7 score, 1 week after baseline (r = .675, P = .008).A
similar decline in FceRI expression after omalizumab treatment was
observed for pDC and mDC CD1c (data not shown).

Furthermore, FceRI expression on basophils at baseline did
not differ between omalizumab responders and non-responders
(P = .202), healthy controls and responders (P = .215), and healthy
controls and non-responders (P = .682) (Figure 2A and B). Moreover,
we did not find a statistical difference (P = .408) when comparing
extremes response groups: complete responders (n = 9, all UAS7 = 0)
to extremely poor responders (n = 7, UAS > 16; median UAS7 = 25).

Total IgE (available for 28 of the 30 patients) did not differ significantly either between responders (n = 15, median: 170.0 kU/L) and
non-responders (n = 13, median 81.9 kU/L; P = .387) or between patients with self-reported atopy (n = 15, median: 122.0) and without
atopy (n = 13, median: 107.0, P = .467). In addition, no correlation
was found between total IgE levels and baseline basophil FceRI expression (r = .081, P = .682). However, when removing one extreme
outlier with a total IgE > 5000 kU/L, a moderate correlation between
baseline total IgE and baseline basophil FceRI expression (r = .4,

WI Ley

= .037) was seen, which was comparable to that mentioned in a

recent study.7°

3.3 | Only basophils percentages increase, other
FceRI-bearing leucocytes remain stable

We measured percentages of basophils, monocytes, pDCs, mDCs
(CD141) and mDCs (CD1c) at baseline (TO), several time-points
during omalizumab treatment, and at 3-months follow-up (T224).
Median percentage of basophils measured in blood showed an
increase during omalizumab treatment (Figure 3) within 1 day
(median: 0.18) compared with baseline (median: 0.13), reaching
a maximum at 4 weeks. At follow-up, the median percentage of
basophils (median: 0.24) was still higher compared with that of
baseline. Healthy controls showed a higher percentage of basophils compared with CSU patients at baseline (P < .001). There
was no difference in median percentage of basophils between
non-responders and responders at any given time-point. However,
we did notice a significantly faster increase in the percentage of
basophils 1 week after the first omalizumab administration in the
responder group compared with that of the non-responder group
(P = .011, [Figure 3B]).

There was no significant change in median percentages of the
other analysed leucocytes, such as eosinophils, monocytes, pDCs,
mDC CDC141*, and mDC CDic* after omalizumab treatment (data

not shown).

3.4 | Anti-lgE- but not C5a-induced basophil
degranulation increases during omalizumab treatment

A significant increase in anti-lgE-induced (1 t4g/mL) basophil activation was observed after 24 hours (P = .042), which was maintained for all the subsequent time-points (Figure 4). A similar
pattern was seen after stimulation with suboptimal concentrations
of anti-IgE (0.3, 0.1, and 0.03 pg/mL). A significant difference was
not observed in baseline anti-lgE-induced basophil degranulation
between responders and non-responders (P = .148). However, nonresponders showed a significantly stronger increase in anti-lgE-induced basophil activation at T28 compared with TO (P = .003) and
at T224 compared with T28 (P = .049), while responders did not
show a significant difference (P = .104 and P = .742, respectively)
(Figure S1).

Contrary to the anti-lgE-induced FceRI-mediated basophil degranulation, C5a-induced degranulation showed a significant reduction (Figure 4) after 1 month of treatment (P = .025) and at all
subsequent time-points during treatment. This reduction in C5ainduced basophil degranulation returned to baseline levels during
the follow-up period. Responders and non-responders showed a
similar pattern of C5a-induced basophil degranulation. When baso
phils were stimulated with a suboptimal concentration of 83 ng/mL,

4 | DISCUSSION
In this study, the effect of omalizumab treatment in CSU on different
FceRI-bearing leucocytes was investigated.

A decline of FceRI on basophils was observed within 1 week
after initiation and during omalizumab treatment, as shown in earlier studies.”® In this study, we present several important and novel
findings. The decreased FceRI expression on basophils persisted up
to 12 weeks after the last dose and was also detected on the mDC
CD1c subset and pDCs. However, this decrease was not found on
monocytes or on the mDC CDD141 subset. We also observed that
the basophil responsiveness was differentially affected by omalizumab treatment, since anti-IgE-, but not C5a-induced basophil degranulation increased during the treatment.

Another important finding was that we could not relate either
the baseline expression or the decline of FceRI expression on basophils to the clinical effect of omalizumab. A recent study”’ suggested
that baseline FceRI expression could predict omalizumab treatment response. In a study of Deza et al, non-responders showed
significantly lower baseline levels of FceRI expression compared
with healthy controls and responders. Furthermore, a decrease in
FceRI expression was mainly observed in responders. In our study,
we found a large overlap in the FceRI levels between healthy controls, responders, and non-responders, and no statistical difference
was found among the three groups. Moreover, we did not find a

statistical difference (P = .408), when complete responders (n = 9,

median UAS7 = 0) were compared to extreme poor responders
(n = 7, UAS > 16, median: 25). Moreover, the change in FceRI levels
did not correlate with the change in urticaria activity (UAS7 scores)
per patient. A possible explanation for the discrepancy between
the two study results might be a difference in patient population.
Although demographics between the two studies were fairly similar, patient-reported outcomes differed noticeably, since 81% of the
patients in the study by Deza et al achieved a UAS7 score of <6 ora
290% reduction in UAS7 vs only 50% in our study.

The decreased FceRI expression levels persisted in patients for
at least 3 months even after discontinuing the omalizumab treatment. Ina similar study, Jorg et al°° found that FceRI expression on
basophils was decreased during omalizumab treatment and up to
2 months after the last dose. These results suggest lasting effects of
omalizumab, which might explain why a proportion of the patients
show a beneficial effect even after long intervals.°+

The median percentage of peripheral blood basophils showed
a rapid and significant increase over time (Figure 3), which has
been described previously during omalizumab and steroid treatment.’*152 None of the other leucocytes showed such a reaction to
omalizumab treatment, which may support a prominent role of basophils. There was no difference between omalizumab responders
and non-responders. However, a significantly stronger increase in
the percentage of basophils was observed in responders compared
with non-responders solely 1 week after the first administration of
omalizumab.

These findings point towards a possible compartmental shift,
in which basophils remain in the circulating blood rather than migrate to the affected skin, as suggested by Grattan et al’? In our
study, 4 of the 30 patients (1 responder, 3 non-responders) reported

sophils by omalizumab. The low pre-treatment level of degranulation
of the basophils might point towards a refractory state of basophils 2
due to activation in CSU. The increase in degranulation was seen in 5
both optimal and suboptimal concentrations of anti-IgE. x
Simultaneously, we found that C5a-induced degranulation of the
basophils was slightly decreased due to omalizumab treatment. This
indicates that the observed increase in anti-lgE-induced degranulation was not an overall increase in intrinsic basophil sensitivity but
was specific for the FceRI-selective activation routes. This can most
probably be explained by the different stimulus-secretion pathways
that are used by FceRI vs G-protein-coupled C5a receptors.°*4 Our 9 & at zt g NX 2 sg aq Bie BF

be a reflection of the different maturation state of basophils due to
decreased tissue inflammation, which in turn reduces the number
of basophils in the skin and potentially leads to a lesser amount of
basophil differentiation in the bone marrow.

Neither anti-lgE- nor C5a-induced basophil activation was
related to treatment response. However, increase in anti-lgE-mediated basophil activation was most apparent in samples from patients not responding to omalizumab (Figure $1). None of the other
cellular responses showed a significant difference between responders and non-responders; therefore, we were not able to elucidate their role in the omalizumab treatment. These findings imply
that the omalizumab-induced basophil changes might be responsible for the underlying clinical effects, but a yet unknown additional
cellular effect could also play a role towards the favourable clinical
response.

Notably, both the decrease in FceRI expression on the cell surface of basophils, and the increase in anti-lgE-mediated basophil
stimulation and decrease in C5a-mediated basophil stimulation continued for at least 3 months after discontinuation of omalizumab.
Given the relative short lifespan of basophils, this suggests either a
prolonged effect of omalizumab or involvement of a more complex
(possibly intracellular) mechanism of action of omalizumab.

Omalizumab induced a rapid and sustained decline of FceRI expression on the surface of basophils, pDCs, and mDC CD1c. Despite
the diminished expression of FceRI on basophils by omalizumab, basophil degranulation was significantly increased after the cross-linking of FceRI to anti-lgE. However, none of the findings could predict
the response of omalizumab treatment, and more research is therefore required. Our findings suggest that response to omalizumab
in CSU patients may be partly explained by pathways involving a
high-affinity IgE receptor of the basophils.
