ABSTRACT

Background: Real-world data on the characteristics and burden of disease among patients with asthma before receiving
asthma-specific biologics would improve the understanding of the use of these therapies in a clinical setting. Currently, limited
data are available on the use of mepolizumab and omalizumab for the treatment of asthma.

Objective: To determine the characteristics and disease burden among patients with asthma before initiating treatment with
mepolizumab or omalizumab.

Methods: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of commercial and Medicare Advantage Plan members from a medical
claims database with a new claim for mepolizumab or omalizumab between January 1, 2015, and March 31, 2017 (GSK ID:
HO-17-18283). Eligible patients had a diagnosis of asthma and continuous enrollment in the health plan, with clinical and
pharmacy benefits for 12 months before initiating asthma-specific biologic treatment (baseline period), and no diagnosis of
chronic idiopathic urticaria during the baseline period. Patient characteristics, exacerbations, and asthma-related health care
resource utilization and costs were assessed during the baseline period.

Results: Overall, 188 and 901 patients prescribed mepolizumab and omalizumab, respectively, were included. In the
12 months before initiating asthma-specific biologic therapy, the patients prescribed mepolizumab were older, had higher blood
eosinophil counts, more-frequent exacerbations (2.9 versus 2.0 exacerbations/year; p < 0.001), and more inhaled corticosteroid
and systemic corticosteroid use compared with those prescribed omalizumab. Overall, asthma-related health-care resource
utilization and costs were similar across both treatment cohorts, although patients prescribed mepolizumab had more pharmacy
fills, higher pharmacy costs, and lower clinic costs compared with patients prescribed omalizumab (20.8 versus 16.9 fills, $4504
versus $3102, and $1816 versus $2709, respectively; all p < 0.001).

Conclusion: In the 12 months before initiating asthma-specific biologic therapy, the patients prescribed mepolizumab may
have a greater disease burden than those prescribed omalizumab. Overall, health-care resource utilization and costs were

broadly similar across both treatment cohorts.

asthma and allergic asthma represent two clinically
recognized and often overlapping phenotypes. Although it is not easy to distinguish these phenotypes in
clinical practice, severe eosinophilic asthma is generally characterized by late onset, eosinophilic inflammation, recurrent exacerbations, and elevated fractional
exhaled nitric oxide levels. In contrast, severe allergic
asthma is characterized by early onset, high serum
immunoglobulin E, elevated fractional exhaled nitric
oxide levels, and eosinophilic inflammation.”

Despite aggressive treatment with high-dose inhaled
corticosteroids (ICS) combined with long-acting controller medication(s) or chronic use of low-dose oral
corticosteroids (OCS), some patients have severe
asthma that remains uncontrolled and continue to experience asthma exacerbations. Both phenotypes are
associated with high asthma-related health-care resource utilization (HCRU) and costs.°” The unmet
therapeutic need in patients with severe asthma has
driven a targeted approach toward molecules that contribute to asthma pathophysiology.” Mepolizumab is a
humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5

that selectively inhibits eosinophilic inflammation and
reduces eosinophil counts in sputum and blood.* It is
indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment of severe asthma in patients =12 years of age and with an
eosinophilic phenotype. Omalizumab is a recombinant
humanized anti-immunoglobulin E antibody approved for use in patients =6 years of age with moderate-to-severe persistent allergic asthma.’ Both drugs
have demonstrated efficacy in terms of reducing exacerbation rates and improving health-related quality of
life.10-1 Although the patient populations for mepolizumab and omalizumab are partly distinct, there is an
overlap in treatment eligibility. Indeed, the prospective, observational study, Identification and Description of sEvere Asthma patients in a cross-sectional
study (IDEAL)'®, found that approximately one-third
of patients who were eligible to use mepolizumab (i.e.,
eosinophilic asthma) were also eligible for omalizumab
(i.e., allergic asthma).

It is important for health-care professionals and payers to gain a real-world understanding of the clinical
characteristics and burden of disease among patients
who use these asthma-specific biologic medications.
This retrospective cohort study aimed to describe the
clinical characteristics, frequency of asthma exacerbations, HCRU, and costs in patients with asthma during
the 12-month period before initiating mepolizumab or
omalizumab therapy for the treatment of asthma.

 

METHODS

Study Design

This was a retrospective cohort analysis of patients in
commercial and Medicare Advantage plans in the Optum Research Database (ORD, Optum, Eden Prairie,
MN). The ORD contains medical and pharmacy claims
with linked enrollment information from a large, geographically diverse U.S. health plan. For 2015, data that
relate to ~13.5 million individuals with commercial
health plans and who had both medical and pharmacy
benefit coverage were available. Patients with a new
claim for mepolizumab or omalizumab were identified
between January 1, 2015, and March 31, 2017 (identification period). The index date was defined as the first
prescription fill for these medications. Data on patients’ clinical characteristics, asthma exacerbations,
and all-cause and asthma-related HCRU and costs
were examined in the 12-month period before and
including the index date (baseline period). This study
used. de-identified retrospective claims data and, as
such, did not require institutional review board review
and approval or informed consent.

Patients

Eligible patients were either commercial or Medicare
Advantage members with a new prescription fill for

Allergy and Asthma Proceedings

mepolizumab or omalizumab during the identification
period; had one or more nondiagnostic medical claims
with a diagnosis code for asthma (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
[ICD-9-CM]'”: code 493.x; International Classification of
Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-10CM]}*: code J45.x) in any position on the claim during
the baseline period; and continuously enrolled with
medical and pharmacy benefits during the baseline
period. Patients with a diagnosis of chronic idiopathic
urticaria (ICD-9-CM: code 708 or ICD-10-CM: code L50)
in any position on the claim or a prescription fill for
omalizumab in the 12 months before the index date
were excluded from the analysis. Patients with a diagnosis code in any position during the baseline period
for eosinophilic esophagitis, hypereosinophilic syndrome, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were
not excluded from the analysis.

End Points and Assessments

End points assessed during the baseline period included patient demographic and clinical characteristics, asthma exacerbations, asthma-related medication
use, and asthma-related and all-cause HCRU and costs.
Patient demographics and clinical characteristics collected included age, gender, insurance type, peripheral
blood eosinophil counts (based on the latest laboratory
test result), and selected comorbidities. A pre-index
Quan-Charlson comorbidity score was calculated based
on the presence of diagnostic codes on medical claims in
the ORD. Asthma-related medications used were also
captured (see Supplemental Material).

Asthma exacerbations (categorized as 0, 1, 2, and
23 exacerbations) were defined as an asthma-related
event that resulted in hospitalization (including an
emergency department [ED] visit that resulted in asthma-related hospitalization within 1 day of the visit)
with an asthma-related exacerbation diagnosis code
(ICD-9-CM diagnosis: codes 493.02, 493.12, 493.92; ICD10-CM diagnosis: codes J4521, J4531, J4541, J4551,
J45901) in any position; or an ED, urgent care, or ambulatory care visit, together with a prescription for
systemic corticosteroid (SCS) or OCS use within 5 days.
Exacerbation events that occurred within 14 days of
each other were considered a single exacerbation episode.

Baseline asthma-related and all-cause HCRU were
calculated for ambulatory visits (clinics and outpatient
or hospital outpatient or surgery visits), ED visits, inpatient admissions, and pharmacy fills. Asthma-related and all-cause health-care costs included the combined amounts paid by the health plan and the patient.
Costs were calculated as the following: total costs;
medical costs, including ambulatory visits (clinics and
outpatient or hospital outpatient or surgery visits), ED

147
visits, inpatient stays, other medical costs; and pharmacy costs.

Statistical Analysis

Study end points were analyzed descriptively and
stratified by cohort. Binary and categorical variables
are presented as numbers and percentages. Continuous variables are presented as mean 32 + standard
deviation (SD). Statistical comparisons were provided
by using the appropriate tests (e.g., Student’s t-test,
Mann-Whitney U test, 32 x* test) based on the distribution of the measure, with a significance level of
=0.05. All analyses were performed by using SAS 9.4
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Costs were adjusted by
using the annual medical care component of the consumer price index to reflect inflation to year 2016. In
addition, a formula developed and owned by Optum
was used to adjust the adjudicated cost amount on the
claim based on a broad sample of claim experience that
deals with the coordination of benefits from multiple
payers’? All patients with cancer during the baseline
period were excluded from HCRU and costs analyses
because they were considered to be potential cost outliers.

RESULTS

Patient Characteristics

Overall, 188 and 901 patients with a prescription
fill for mepolizumab and omalizumab, respectively,
met the inclusion criteria (Fig. 1). Patients prescribed
mepolizumab were older than those prescribed
omalizumab (mean age, 54.4 versus 50.4 years)
(p < 0.001) (Table 1). There were no significant differences in gender, insurance, or comorbidity scores.
Of the selected comorbidities in Table 1, a significantly lower proportion of patients prescribed
mepolizumab versus omalizumab had allergic rhinitis (66.5% versus 78.0%; p < 0.001) and a higher
proportion had nasal polyps (20.2% versus 11.3%;
p < 0.001).

Blood eosinophil results were available for 38.8%
and 34.4% of the patients prescribed mepolizumab and
omalizumab, respectively, in the baseline period (Table
1). Among these patients, mepolizumab tended to be
prescribed to patients with higher eosinophil counts. The
majority of the patients (91.8%) prescribed mepolizumab
had blood eosinophil counts = 150 cells/wL; 58.9% had
eosinophil counts = 400 cells/L. In contrast, only 30% of
the patients prescribed omalizumab had blood eosinophil counts = 400 cells/wL.

(29 + 2.3 versus 2.0 + 2.0; p < 0.001) (Fig. 2). The
proportion of patients who experienced more than three
exacerbations was also significantly higher among patients prescribed mepolizumab versus omalizumab
(31.4% versus 19.0%; p < 0.001). No significant differences in the mean + SD number of exacerbations that
required hospitalizations were observed (Fig. 2).

Medication Use in the 12 Months Before AsthmaSpecific Biologic Use

During the baseline period, a significantly greater
proportion of patients prescribed mepolizumab used
ICS, either alone or with a long-acting B-agonist versus
patients prescribed omalizumab (83.5% versus 72.0%;
p = 0.001) (Table 2). Moreover, a greater proportion of
patients prescribed mepolizumab compared with
omalizumab used SCS (94.2% versus 84.1%; p < 0.001)
for acute and chronic use, including use for = 60 days/y
(53.7% versus 29.4%; p < 0.001).

HCRU in the 12 Months Before Asthma-Specific
Biologic Use

All-cause and asthma-related HCRU were generally
similar across cohorts, with few exceptions. Notably, a
greater proportion of patients prescribed mepolizumab
versus omalizumab had asthma-related outpatient,
hospital outpatient, or surgery visits (58.0% versus
48.4%; p = 0.017) and used asthma-related medications

DISCUSSION

In this retrospective cohort analysis, we assessed
the disease burden among the patients prescribed
mepolizumab or omalizumab for the treatment of
asthma in the 12 months before initiating therapy.
The patients prescribed mepolizumab had a greater
disease burden, with significantly more asthma exacerbations and greater ICS, SCS and asthma-specific
medication use compared with those prescribed
omalizumab. Despite these differences, HCRU and
costs in the 12 months before biologic use were
similar between the treatment cohorts.

The real-world IDEAL study’? demonstrated that
mepolizumab- and omalizumab-eligible populations
have broadly similar demographics; however, patients
eligible for mepolizumab tended to be older, had
higher blood eosinophil counts, and had more frequent
exacerbations in the past 12 months compared with
patients who were eligible to use omalizumab. Consistent with the IDEAL cross-sectional study,’° our study
suggests that, compared with patients prescribed
omalizumab, those prescribed mepolizumab were
older, had a lower prevalence of allergic rhinitis, and
higher blood eosinophil counts. The difference in age

between the two groups likely reflects the treatment
indications for omalizumab and mepolizumab;
omalizumab is approved for use in patients =6 years of
age who have moderate-to-severe allergic asthma,’
whereas mepolizumab is approved for use in patients
212 years of age with severe eosinophilic asthma,’
which typically has a later onset than severe allergic
asthma.**

Our study also suggests that the patients prescribed
mepolizumab have more severe disease than those
prescribed omalizumab. In the 12 months before initi
Allergy and Asthma Proceedings

ating therapy, the patients prescribed mepolizumab
had more frequent exacerbations, with 31.4% of patients who had more than three exacerbations compared with 19.0% of patients prescribed omalizumab.
Although the mean number of exacerbations that required hospitalization was similar between the two
groups, it is unclear whether the exacerbations that occurred in patients prescribed mepolizumab may have
been more or less severe in nature. Patients prescribed
mepolizumab also had greater use of ICS and SCS in the
12 months before initiating therapy compared with those

151
prescribed omalizumab, which indicated that patients
prescribed mepolizumab required more intensive treatment to control their symptoms. Previous studies demonstrated that asthma severity increases with age and
that severe disease is often associated with more frequent
exacerbations and medication use.””°

Despite the differences in baseline characteristics and
exacerbation frequency between patients prescribed
mepolizumab and those prescribed omalizumab,
HCRU and costs were generally similar between the
two treatment cohorts, with total asthma-related costs
of $10,782 and $10,037 per patient in the year before
mepolizumab and omalizumab treatment, respectively. The only significant differences in HCRU and
costs between the cohorts were pharmacy use and
costs, which were greater among patients prescribed
mepolizumab, and clinic costs, which were higher
among patients prescribed omalizumab. Higher clinic
costs may reflect that some patients with allergic
asthma regularly attended clinics to receive allergy
immunotherapy. Alternatively, patients with allergic
asthma may have experienced a greater frequency of
asthma symptoms or mild exacerbations that resulted
in clinic visits, compared with patients with eosinophilic asthma who experienced more moderate-severe
exacerbations. It should be noted that, although the
additional costs of biologic therapies would be high,
these would be expected to reduce the rate of exacerbations and, therefore, have a substantial impact on the
associated HCRU and costs.

In contrast to our results, a similar retrospective cohort study, which included patients from the U.S.based MarketScan™ Commercial Claims and Encounters Database (Truven Health Analytics, Ann Arbor,
MI), found that asthma-related total costs were significantly higher in the 12 months before the patients
were prescribed mepolizumab versus omalizumab
($11,000 versus $7400 per patient; p < 0.001).7' Consistent with Llanos et al.,7' several previous studies demonstrated higher asthma-related HCRU and costs in
patients with frequent exacerbations than those without,2072-23, Interestingly, we found that the higher frequency of exacerbations among patients prescribed
mepolizumab versus omalizumab was associated with
a higher number of pharmacy visits and fills but not
with an increase in outpatient, ED, or inpatient visits.
The discord between our results and previous studies
in this respect may be due to demographic and clinical
differences between the patient populations (e.g., age,
incidence of comorbidities, or levels of maintenance
combination therapy).'°''’'*?! In addition, the current
study excluded patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, which may have generated an omalizumab cohort with more-severe disease than in other studies in
which this comorbidity was permitted.! Overall, the
patients prescribed omalizumab in the current study

152

may represent a cluster of patients as identified in the
Severe Asthma Research Program (NCT01606826) with
severe disease, who are atopic, older, and have a high
incidence of comorbidities and HCRU.*

Although mepolizumab is indicated for the treatment of severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype,
we found that <40% of patients included in this study
had an eosinophil count recorded. It is possible that
those patients with missing data on the eosinophil
count may have been prescribed mepolizumab based
on a historic blood eosinophil count that was not captured in the Optum database. Nonetheless, the low
numbers of patients with an eosinophil count available
limited the conclusions that could be drawn regarding
overall blood eosinophil counts within either cohort. It
is worth noting that >90% of the patients with data
available and who were prescribed mepolizumab had
a blood eosinophil count of =150 cells/uL in the
12 months before receiving therapy. The 8% of patients
who were prescribed mepolizumab but only had
counts of <150 cells/wL captured in the database in the
12 months before treatment may have had missing
data within the payers data base or a historic blood
eosinophil count of =300 cells/wL. Alternatively, these
patients may have been prescribed mepolizumab for
other reasons, e.g., its steroid-sparing ef ect.”4 Indeed,
nearly half of the patients prescribed mepolizumab
had OCS use for >60 days a year, which suggested
chronic use and, consequently, potential depletion of
blood eosinophils, which supported the notion that
mepolizumab may have been prescribed for its steroidsparing effect.

Other limitations of the study included the nature of
the claims data source. The presence of a dispensed
medication did not indicate that the medication was
consumed or that it was taken as prescribed. Furthermore, details of medications received outside of an
insurance claim were not captured for patients in the
database. The provision of a diagnosis code on a medical encounter or outside claim may not be conclusive
of a positive disease presence because the diagnosis
code may be incorrectly coded or included as a ruleout criterion rather than actual disease. Also, results
and conclusions may not be generalizable to other
commercially insured populations in the United States.

 

CONCLUSION

This retrospective analysis demonstrates that patients prescribed mepolizumab had a higher disease
burden in the 12 months before initiating therapy compared with those prescribed omalizumab, indicated by
a higher exacerbation rate and a higher eosinophil
count. These clinical characteristics are important considerations in the assessment of patients with asthma
pre-biologic use. Interestingly, the differences ob

not translate into differences in HCRU and costs. Additional real-world studies are needed to further confirm these observations and expand on additional clinical features that may influence treatment selection.
