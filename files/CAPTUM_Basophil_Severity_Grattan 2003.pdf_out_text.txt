Summary

Background The basopenia of chronic urticaria relates to histamine releasing autoantibodies in the
serum of patients with autoimmune urticaria. This reduction in circulating basophils may be due to
active recruitment into weals. If so, it might be expected that numbers in blood would be reduced
when urticaria is active and increased after treatment. The primary aim of this study was to look at
diurnal variation of basophil numbers in patients with chronic ordinary urticaria (not physical or
vasculitic) in relation to disease activity and the effect of treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids, and to compare the results with healthy controls. A secondary aim was to compare a
standard manual counting method with automated basophil counts and to look at numbers of other
circulating leucocytes that might be relevant to urticaria pathogenesis.

Methods Manual basophil counts using a toluidine blue stain and automated 5-part differentials
(Coulter® Gen. S™) were performed at 4-hourly intervals from 08.00 to 20.00 in 10 healthy controls
(six women, age 24 to 63 years) and seven chronic urticaria patients (five women, 24 to 50 years). All
chronic urticaria patients had severe daily or almost daily urticaria. Only one of six chronic urticaria
sera showed in vitro basophil histamine releasing activity. Counts were performed without treatment,
after a week of taking loratadine 10 mg daily and after 3 days of adding prednisolone at 0.6 mg/kg/
day (maximum 40 mg). Daily urticarial activity scores (UAS) were derived from weal numbers and
itch, maximum 7.

Results There was no significant overall diurnal variation of basophil numbers in healthy controls
or chronic urticaria patients. Mean (SE) manually counted basophil were higher in healthy controls
than chronic urticaria (43.4/L (2.1) vs. 4.4 (0.8), P<0.001). Basophil counts were reduced in
healthy controls on steroids (19.2 (1.9), P<0.001) but increased in chronic urticaria (8.9 (1.9),
P <0.001). Loratadine did not influence them. UAS fell on treatment (3.3 (0.4) baseline, 1.4 (0.5)
on loratadine and 0.5 (0.2) on prednisolone with loratadine, P < 0.001). There was a negative linear
correlation between basophil numbers and UAS in untreated chronic urticaria patients (P = 0.001,
Spearman rank correlation). Manual and automated basophil counts showed poor agreement.
Lymphocyte numbers were lower in chronic urticaria than healthy controls. Neutrophils increased
whereas lymphocytes and eosinophils decreased in all subjects on prednisolone. They were unaffected by loratadine.

Conclusion The results are consistent with the hypothesis that circulating basophils may be recruited from blood into urticarial weals during disease activity. Automated counts are not suitable
for assessing basophil numbers in chronic urticaria. The relevance of reduced lymphocyte numbers
in chronic urticaria needs to be explored.

Introduction

Basophils represent only about 1% of circulating leucocytes in
health. Basophilia has been associated with chronic inflammation, endocrine disorders and infections, iron deficiency and
some types of neoplasia but basopenia has only been linked

urticaria, using a metachromatic granule stain [2]. His observation has been confirmed in more recent studies using manual
counting [3, 4] and flow cytometry [4]. Absence of blood basophils relates closely to the presence of basophil histamine releasing activity in autologous serum [4] and therefore appears to be
a useful marker for autoimmune urticaria. Autoimmune urticaria is now classified as a subset of ordinary urticaria [5]. The
term ‘ordinary’ embraces all urticarias that cannot be attributed
to a physical, vasculitic or contact cause and includes those
cases with ‘idiopathic’ disease where the aetiology remains unknown despite full evaluation. Loss of granules as a reason for
the apparent basopenia seems unlikely as basophil numbers are
similar whether counted manually using a granule stain or flow
cytometrically using dual staining with monoclonal antibodies
against IgE and FceRI on the cell surface [4].

It is possible that the peripheral blood basopenia is due to
active recruitment of basophils into weals. Sustained histamine
release from tissue basophils might explain why urticarial weals
are more prolonged than after histamine injection in healthy
subjects [6]. Preliminary data using the basophil-specific monoclonal BB1 indicate that basophils are increased in chronic
urticaria weals of at least 12h duration [7] but definitive evidence of migration into skin is still lacking. A relationship
between diurnal urticarial activity and an influence of treatment
with antihistamines and steroids on blood basophil numbers
might be expected if this hypothesis is correct.

Manual counting of basophils is time-consuming and subject
to errors due to the relatively small numbers of cells in the
counting chamber. We have therefore compared it with automated counting using the basophil channel of a Coulter® Gen.
S™ system, which uses a triple system to identify cells based on
light scatter, impedance and the effect of high frequency signals.
Size and granularity are some of the factors that influence the
results. Accurate automated basophil counts could offer a simple clinical test to support a diagnosis of autoimmune urticaria
and facilitate monitoring of disease activity. We have also
looked for fluctuations in the number of other circulating leucocytes in healthy controls and chronic urticaria patients as
neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes are typically found
in urticaria biopsies [8] and may be involved in its pathogenesis.

 

 

 

 

Methods

Subjects

Seven patients with daily or almost daily chronic urticaria (age
range 24 to 50 years, median 35 years; five women) lasting more
than 6 weeks (range 3 months to 26 years, median 12 months),
teferred to the Dermatology Department of the Norfolk and
Norwich University Hospital by primary care practitioners,
were recruited. Those with predominantly physical or vasculitic
urticaria were excluded by a careful clinical assessment. Ten
healthy controls (age range 24 to 63 years, median 39 years; six
women), were recruited from technical, medical and nursing
staff. Exclusions were Cl esterase inhibitor deficiency, children
less than 16 years, pregnant or breast-feeding mothers, patients
with known systemic lupus erythematosus, thyroid disease,
Cushing’s disease, active inflammatory bowel disease, dyspepsia, acute infection within 3 weeks, hypereosinophilia, hyperlipidaemia, and known immunosuppression. None of the

participants were on the long-acting antihistamine astemizole
within 6 weeks, immunosuppressive medications, systemic steroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, doxepin, oestrogens or progestagens within 4weeks or had had previous
adverse reactions to loratadine or prednisolone.

Trial medication

All urticaria patients were asked to stop antihistamines at least
7 days prior to the study. Calamine lotion, crotamiton cream or
1% menthol in aqueous cream were allowed for symptomatic
relief of pruritus. All participants started loratadine 10 mg mane
on day 2 until the close of study (day 14). Prednisolone was
introduced at 0.6 mg/kg body weight (maximum 40 mg) once a
day after breakfast for the last 3 days of the study (days 12 to
14),

 

Blood samples

Venous blood was taken into K;3EDTA tubes (Vacutainer®,
Becton Dickinson, New Jersey, USA) for manual and automated basophil counts at 08.00, 12.00, 16.00 and 20.00 on
day 1 (baseline counts off treatment), after 1 week on loratadine
and on the third day of taking prednisolone with loratadine (the
08.00 sample being taken just before the third and final dose of
prednisolone). Venous blood was clotted for at least 30 min in
plain Vacutainer® tubes before centrifugation at 450 g for skin
testing. Residual serum was stored at — 70°C for histamine
release assays.

Cell counting

Manual basophil counts were performed at a 1/5 dilution of a
toluidine blue-based stain [9] using a modified Fuchs-Rosenthal
(Manners) chamber, as described previously [10] and expressed
as counts/1L of whole blood. Automated counts were made
using the basophil channel of a Coulter® Gen. S™ system
(Coulter Electronics Ltd, Luton, UK) within 6 h of venesection
during routine full blood counts. The lower limit of automated
counting was 10 basophils/uL; any counts below this were
reported as zero. Lymphocyte, neutrophil, monocyte and eosinophil counts were taken from the same five-part automated
differentials.

Basophil histamine release assays

Serum histamine releasing activity was tested on basophils from
a healthy well-characterized donor with low serum IgE, as
described previously [4]. Each serum was tested on basophils
from which IgE had been eluted by lactic acid treatment [11]
and, in a separate experiment, on basophils that had been
passively sensitized with myeloma IgE (a gift from Dr J Hakimi,
Hoffman La-Roche, Nutley, NJ, USA). The results were expressed as the percentage of total histamine content in each
sample released from the cells into the supernatant after correction for background serum fluorescence and control spontaneous release. Histamine release > 5% was regarded as positive.

Urticarial activity assessments

Patients recorded the number and size of weals, severity of
itching and episodes of angio-oedema at 4-hourly intervals
between 08.00 and 20.00 during the 2-week study period. A
scoring system of 0 to 4 points was used for weal severity (no
weals, 0; 1 to 10 small weals, 1; 11 to 50 small weals or 1 to 10

large weals, 2; > 50 small weals or > 10 large weals, 3; almost
covered, 4) and 0 to 3 for pruritus (none, 0; mild, 1; moderate, 2;
severe, 3) as published previously [12]. Thus, the least urticarial
activity score (UAS) for any time point was 0 and the greatest
was 7.

Autologous serum skin tests (ASST)

Intradermal skin tests with 50pL of autologous serum were
conducted on the volar forearm and any resulting weal response
measured at 30 min, as described previously [13]. A pink weal
response 1.5mm or greater than an adjacent normal saline
control skin test was regarded as evidence of endogenous histamine releasing activity due to functional autoantibodies or a
mast cell specific factor [14].

Ethics approval

The study protocol was approved by the Norwich Health District Ethics Committee. All participants gave written informed
consent.

Statistical analysis

Baseline basophil counts in healthy controls and chronic urticaria patients were compared with an unpaired test after
checking for normal distribution of the data (normality test,
Statworks™, Cricket Software Inc., Philadelphia, PA, USA).
Differences between leucocyte counts at 4-hourly intervals over
the day were compared with 1-way ANova. Differences in diurnal counts at baseline and on treatment were compared with 2way ANOVA. UAS were compared on and off treatment with the
Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Spearman rank correlation was
used for examining linear association between baseline basophil
counts and UAS. Comparison of manual and automated basophil counting methods was done by agreement of methods
analysis [15]. All statistical tests were two-tailed and assumed
a 5% level of significance.

Results

Healthy controls

There was no significant diurnal variation in basophil numbers
counted manually without treatment. Mean (SE) counts/pL
over the 12-h baseline period were 43.4 (2.1). There was no
significant difference on loratadine (44.9; 1.8) but there was a
significant reduction on prednisolone (19.2, 1.9; F-ratio 117.4,
P <0.001, two-way ANova). Basophil numbers fell rapidly after
a morning dose of prednisolone (Fig. la) (F-ratio 85.0,
P<0.001, one-way ANOVA).

There was poor agreement between manual and automated
basophil counts (Fig. 2). Automated counts two SD either side
of the mean difference between methods might be as high as
33/uL above the equivalent manual count or 24 below it (range
of the difference 57).

Chronic urticaria patients

Six patients developed a pink weal response at least 1.5mm
greater than an adjacent normal saline control injection within
30min of intradermal injection of 50,.L of their own serum
(mean diameter (SD) 3.1 (1.3) mm). Five of these sera were
available for assay on basophils. Only one showed in vitro

Basophils were only consistently absent in the one patient with
in vitro evidence of autoantibodies. There was no significant
diurnal variation. Numbers rose after treatment with loratadine
(8.2; 0.1) and prednisolone (8.9, 1.8; F-ratio 14.3, P< 0.001,
two-way ANOVA) (Fig. 1b).

UAS fell significantly from baseline (3.3; 0.4) on loratadine
(1.4, 0.5; P< 0.001, Wilcoxon signed ranks test) and prednisolone (0.5, 0.2; P< 0.001, Wilcoxon signed ranks test). There was
a significant negative correlation between baseline basophil
numbers and UAS (Fig. 3; Spearman rank correlation 0.612,
P=0.001).

All automated basophil counts were zero at each time point.

Lymphocyte numbers/1L whole blood (mean x 10°, SE)
were consistently lower in untreated chronic urticaria than
healthy controls (2.05 (0.12) vs. 2.66 (0.12), t= —3.576,

t=— 3.474, P=0.001). They fell on steroids in both chronic
urticaria and healthy controls, but by a smaller amount in

Neutrophils/pL whole blood (mean x 10°, SE) were slightly
more numerous in untreated chronic urticaria than healthy
controls (5.5 (0.3) vs. 4.5 (0.3), t= 2.543, P=0.013). They increased after steroids (6.4 (0.5) vs. 7.5 (0.3), P = not significant).

Discussion

The findings of this study reaffirm the reduction of peripheral
blood basophils in active chronic urticaria. Collectively, there
was no significant diurnal variation in numbers in healthy controls or chronic urticaria patients. There was, however, an
association between numbers and urticarial activity, which supports the hypothesis that basophils may be actively recruited
from the circulation into weals by endothelial adhesion molecule expression secondary to chemokines, such as interleukin-8,
released from dermal inflammatory cells. Improvement of urticaria on antihistamines and oral corticosteroids is well known.
The mechanisms for this improvement may include inhibition
of migration of basophil into skin by reducing markers of
activation and vascular adhesion molecule expression. Antiallergic properties have been ascribed to loratadine [16], which
might contribute to its clinical benefits in urticaria in addition to
its antihistaminic action. Enhanced apoptosis of basophils by
steroids could explain the fall of basophil numbers in healthy
controls, while the slight increase from baseline in chronic
urticaria patients might result from a predominant inhibition
of recruitment.

It may be relevant that the only patient with consistently
absent stainable blood basophils at baseline also showed high
levels of functional autoantibodies in her serum. This raises the
possibility that functional autoantibodies enhance basopenia
by binding to FceRI, leading to expression of basophil surface
activation markers such as CD63 and enhancing selective removal by the reticuloendothelial system. Inhibition of anti-IgE
induced histamine release has been reported in chronic urticaria
basophils [17], and up-regulation of histamine release by interleukin-3 [18], illustrating the functional changes that occur in
addition to basopenia. Reduced (as opposed to absent) blood

Blood basophil numbers

 

basophil numbers have been shown for patients with ‘nonautoantibody’ chronic urticaria [3]. These may be the individuals who have a mast cell specific factor [14] that can elicit a
positive ASST but will not show in vitro activity on basophils.
The proposed recruitment of basophils into weals in response to
adhesion molecule expression that results from mast cell degranulation could be expected to occur whether the activating
stimulus is an autoantibody or some other histamine releasing
agent.

There was poor agreement between manual counts based ona
granule stain and automated basophil counts based on size and
granularity in healthy controls, due partly to the low number of
leucocytes counted in an individual sample (about 4000).
Failure to discriminate between low (< 10/yL) and absent basophil numbers in chronic urticaria implies that the current
methodology is unlikely to be of value in screening for chronic
urticaria patients with functional autoantibodies. Programming automated differential counts to screen larger numbers
of leucocytes (such as 40 000) might improve the level of agreement between these methods.

A reduction in total blood lymphocytes has not been reported
previously to our knowledge although increased proliferation
of activated B cells and increased expression of CD,o,_ on in vitro
activated T cells has been reported in the blood of chronic
urticaria patients [19], pointing to functional as well as numerical changes in lymphocyte populations.

The relative reduction of blood eosinophils in chronic urticaria compared with healthy controls is consistent with their
presence in lesional skin biopsies [8] and may be analogous to
the increased numbers of basophils and eosinophils found in the
late cutaneous reaction of immediate hypersensitivity reactions
[20]. The role of tissue eosinophils is unclear but it is possible
that release of toxic eosinophil major basic and eosinophil
cationic proteins further augments histamine release from
mast cells in the late phase of urticarial weals.
