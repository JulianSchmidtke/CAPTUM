Summary

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory skin disease affecting
> 10% of children and 1-3% of adults, and can cause significant morbidity. The
incidence of AD seems to be increasing. Omalizumab, a monoclonal antibody, has
recently been suggested as a potential new systemic treatment for patients with
recalcitrant AD with elevated IgE levels, based on its efficacy in treating asthma and
allergic rhinitis. We report a study of 10 patients with AD (aged 19-35 years) who
received anti-IgE treatment for persistent asthma. All patients, regardless of IgE value,
were treated with a fixed schedule of eight cycles of omalizumab 300 mg administered
subcutaneously at intervals of 2 weeks. Eczema symptoms were scored at baseline and
after 2, 4 and 6 months of treatment. There was a steady improvement in the objective
SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis), with significantly lower scores observed at the
6-month evaluation. At 2 months after the end of treatment, two patients had a very
good result (SCORAD reduction of > 50%), five patients had a satisfactory result
(reduction of 25-50%), and three patients had no clinically relevant result (reduction
of 25-50%). No patient had worsening of the AD (increase of > 25% in SCORAD), and
once a clinical improvement occurred, none of the patients experienced worsening of
their eczema symptoms while on omalizumab. With the caveats of the financial
expense and unknown long-term risks of malignancy associated with omalizumab, this
drug should be considered for treatment-resistant patients with AD, particularly
patients with high IgE level whose symptoms are not controlled by routine therapies.
Omalizumab has proven useful in treating asthma, but it may also prove valuable for
other conditions, such as allergic rhinitis, food allergies, chronic urticaria, and AD, as
shown by the present study.

 

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic and relapsing
inflammatory skin disease affecting > 10% of children
and 1-3% of adults.! It can cause significant morbidity,
and the incidence appears to be increasing.! AD often
precedes the occurrence of asthma, allergic rhinitis and
food allergy, otherwise known as ‘the atopic march’.?

Although AD is commonly associated with raised serum
IgE, the diagnosis of AD is mainly clinical. The pattern
of chronic inflammation is characterized by lichenification, thickened skin, hyperpigmentation and a debilitating itch-scratch cycle. These processes can impair
the patient's quality of life, affecting their sleep cycles,
work or school performance, and overall emotional
wellbeing.’

Depending on the clinical severity, AD is treated with
topical agents, including bland emollients, topical
steroids, tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, and with oral
agents such as antibiotics, systemic corticosteroids,
antihistamines and ciclosporin.t However, severe or

recalcitrant AD does not often respond satisfactorily to
most conventional therapies. Therefore, many dermatologists have attempted to treat severe or recalcitrant
AD using alternatives such as dapsone, azathioprine,
mycophenolate mofetil and intravenous immunoglobulin.
Omalizumab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that
binds IgE at the same binding site as FceRI and FceRII,
thereby inhibiting mast-cell or basophil activation.
Because of the efficacy of omalizumab in treating asthma
and allergic rhinitis,” which are components of the classic
allergic triad, it has recently been used as a potential new
systemic treatment for patients with recalcitrant AD with
rasised IgE levels. We report the first case series of East
Asian patients with AD successfully treated with
omalizumab.

Report

This study enrolled 10 patients with AD (6 male, 4
female; mean + SD age 26.2 + 5.7 years, median 26.5,
range 19-35) who received anti-IgE treatment. All
patients had a history of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and
allergic asthma, had total serum IgE values far in excess
of 1000 IU/mL, and had undergone at least one

standard therapy (systemic corticosteroids, ciclosporin,
ultraviolet radiation) before enrolment. The patients’
atopic symptoms were not controlled despite conventional regimens, including oral second-generation antihistamine, intranasal steroids, the maximum dose of
inhaled corticosteroids, and a long-acting inhaled B2
agonist. For the relief of cutaneous symptoms, all 10
patients had been prescribed high-potency topical corticosteroids at some time, and 7 of them had received
topical tacrolimus or pimecrolimus. Additionally, an
elimination diet, followed by three patients with identified food allergies, had failed to control the dermatitis.
Three more patients had undergone several sessions of
narrowband ultraviolet B treatment, but improvement
was minimal. None of the patients had undergone
received immunotherapy in the past or had received
more than three short courses of oral steroids in the
preceding 12 months before treatment was started.
None of the patients had received any systemic treatment for at least 6 weeks before inclusion.

All patients had positive results for skin tests or multiple
allergosorbent test for common aeroallergens and high
IgE titres (mainly > 5000 IU/mL) (Table 1). Regardless
of IgE value, all patients were treated with a fixed schedule

of eight cycles of omalizamab 300 mg (Xolair®; Novartis
Korea, Seoul, South Korea), given subcutaneously at 2week intervals. Patients were allowed to use emollients
but no other systemic treatment.

Before each visit, SCORAD assessment was performed
and photographs were taken. Quality of life (QOL) was
assessed for patients aged > 16 years, using selfadministered questionnaires that incorporated a validated Korean version of the Dermatology Life Quality
Index (DLQI). Severity of pruritus and sleep loss were
assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Eczema
symptoms, pruritus, sleep loss, and DLOI were scored at
baseline, after 1, 2, 3 and 4 months of treatment, and at
1, 2, 3 and 4 months after the end of treatment.

The objective SCORAD decreased from 56.5 + 8.4 at
baseline to 42.2 + 9.0 at the end of treatment, a 25.2%
improvement (Fig. 1). At 2 months after the end of

treatment, two patients had a very good result (SCORAD reduction of > 50%), five patients had a satisfactory result (reduction of 25-50%), and three patients
had no clinically relevant result (reduction of 25-50%).
Similarly, VAS scores decreased from baseline to the end
of treatment, reducing from 6.3 + 1.7 to 3.7 + 1.3 for
pruritus, and from 5.5 + 1.2 to 2.8 + 1.0 for sleep loss.
DLQI scores also decreased, from 12.6 + 3.7 at baseline
to 6.5 + 3.7 at the end of treatment. Improvements
were maintained until the last assessment, at 4 months
after the end of the treatment period.

Clinical improvement became evident after approximately 2 months of treatment (Fig. 2). Once a clinical
improvement occurred, none of the patients experienced
worsening of their eczema symptoms again while on
omalizumab, and the improvement was maintained until
the assessment 4 months after the end of treatment.

Frequent exacerbations and remissions are typical of
AD, but none of the patients experienced these. Omalizumab was well tolerated by all patients without signs
of adverse reactions, and no patient discontinued
treatment.

Omalizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal
anti-IgE antibody recognizing human IgE at the same
position as the high-affinity receptor FceRI, is effective
in reducing asthma exacerbations and allergic rhinitis.
The efficacy of omalizumab in reducing serum IgE
level has led to preliminary applications in selected
patients with AD alone or AD in combination with
allergic asthma.*° QOmalizumab binds to the Fe
region of all forms of circulating IgE, preventing
IgE-medicated reactions.’ It also downregulates highaffinity IgE receptors by binding to and and inactivating IgE.”

Omalizumab is approved to treat severe asthma in
patients with a serum IgE level of < 700 IU/mL. In this
study, we assessed its efficacy in treating patients with
AD with serum IgE levels far exceeding 700 IU/mL. Our
patients had serum IgE levels of 5000 IU/mL or higher,
far exceeding the approved limit for omalizumab treatment. Consequently, we used omalizumab at a much
lower dosage than that required for the complete
removal of IgE from the circulation. This antibody
apparently does not have to completely remove IgE from
serum to achieve good clinical response. Notably,
molecular changes such as a switch to reduced IgE/IgG
mRNA production seem to be good indicators of which
patients will have clinical response. The effect of
omalizumab in these patients seems to be a regulatory
mechanism rather than simple blocking of IgE.*

Omalizumab has been used previously to treat
patients with AD with omalizumab. Similar to our
study, most of these trials have had positive results.’
Recently, Belloni et al. published their experience with

11 patients with severe adult AD who had improvement
of the disease after treatment with omalizumab 150 mg,
administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks for 10
cycles. Of the 11 patients, 6 had a ‘good’ to ‘very good’
clinical response, as measured by a decrease in SCORAD, with no relevant clinical change seen in 3 patients
and flares seen in 2 patients. These results also indicate
the usefulness of omalizumab in selected patients with
AD. However, there have been trials reporting treatment failures.° In general, the successful trials had
longer treatment periods. Although the free IgE is
extensively and very rapidly suppressed after omalizumab administration, it takes up to 3 months before
this suppression has an effect on eczema symptoms.
Similarly, no improvement in symptoms was noted in
our study during the first 2 months of omalizumab
treatment, but improvements in SCORAD, DLOI, and
pruritus and sleep loss VAS scores were evident from the
third month after initiation of omalizumab treatment.
Thus, the treatment and follow-up period must be
sufficiently long to allow an effect to be seen.

Seven patients in the present study experienced clinical
improvement and decreased exacerbations in their AD
after treatment with omalizumab. The differences in the
clinical outcomes may reflect the multifactorial aetiology
of AD, with IgE as one of several potential mediators.
Although the precise role of IgE in AD is not known,
several reports have shown that AD produces the highest
serum IgE levels of all allergic diseases.'°

The serum IgE levels in our patients were much
higher than those quoted in the initial studies of patients
with asthma treated with omalizumab. Omalizumab is
licensed only for treatment of patients with serum IgE
levels of < 700 IU/mL, but is not contraindicated for
patients with higher levels. The pretreatment serum IgE
levels ranged from 1704 to over 5000 IU/mL in our
patients, and this could account for the therapeutic

success observed for these severely atopic patients. In
addition, the varying magnitudes of clinical improvement of our patients could reflect insufficient dosing of
omalizumab, as their pretreatment IgE levels fell outside
the dosing administration table.

Omalizumab has proven useful in treating asthma,
but the continued exploration of this in the treatment of
other conditions, such as allergic rhinitis and AD, may
be beneficial, as shown by the present study. Although
the numbers enrolled were small, and thus statistical
conclusions cannot be drawn, the study provides further
preliminary evidence that anti-IgE therapy may be
beneficial in severe, refractory AD. Large, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trials are
warranted to adequately assess the efficacy of omalizumab in patients with AD and to determine if certain
subsets of patients might benefit more than others.

In conclusion, we report the first study of omalizumab
in the treatment of AD in East Asia. We suggest that
omalizumab be considered for treatment-resistant patients with AD, especially patients with high IgE levels
whose symptoms are not controlled by routine therapeutic regimens.
