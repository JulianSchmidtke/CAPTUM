Summary

Background. Clinical trials have shown the efficacy of omalizumabs efficacy in
refractory chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and chronic inducible urticaria
(CIndU), but real-life management strategies are lacking.

Aim. To assess the long-term efficacy and safety of omalizumab, and to identify predictive factors and optimum dosage regimens.

Methods. This was a prospective study of 13 patients (11 women, 2 men) with
severe CSU [weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7) > 28] resistant to anti-H1 antihistamines. Patients were started on omalizumab 150 mg subcutaneously every
4 weeks. Dose and interval between administrations were adjusted according to clinical response (189 administrations; treatment duration range 2-38 months).
Results. Mean UAS7 was 36.3 + 5.4. Of the 13 patients, all had experienced
angio-oedema, while in addition, 7 had delayed pressure urticaria (DPU) and 1 had
solar urticaria (SU). After omalizumab treatment, 4 (30.8%) of the 13 patients had
complete response (CR), and the remaining 8 (61.5%) had partial response. CR was
achieved with a dose of 150 mg every 4 (n = 2 patients) or 5 (n = 2) weeks. One of
these patients remained disease-free after stopping treatment. Partial responses were
achieved with 150 mg every 4 weeks (n = 4) and with 300 mg (n = 4) at intervals
of 5 weeks (n = 1), 4 weeks (n = 2) or 3 weeks (n = 1). Only one patient (7.7%) did
not show significant improvement, despite a dose of 300 mg every 4 weeks. There
were no significant differences in epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data
between the different response groups. Only two adverse events were observed: one
was mild headache and the other was severe angio-oedema and aggravation of urticaria within 6 h of omalizumab administration.

Conclusion. Omalizumab dose and interval between administrations could be individualized for long-term management of CSU.

line therapy, up to four times the licensed antihistamine dose may be beneficial, but about 45% of
patients still fail to respond.* In such cases, ciclosporin, montelukast, or omalizumab are recommended
as add-on therapies for third-line treatment, although
only omalizumab is a licensed option.

Clinical trials (ASTERIA I,* ASTERIA IP and GLACIAL®) and many isolated clinical reports have demonstrated that omalizumab is a valid and safe treatment
for recalcitrant CSU and many cases of CIndU.” !?
Consequently, omalizumab has been approved by the
European Medical Agency (EMA) and the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of CSU at
dosages of 300 mg (EMA) or 150-300 mg (FDA)
every 4 weeks.

Nevertheless, there remain many questions concerning the use of omalizumab, and the literature lacks
long-term management strategies. The objectives of
our study were to assess the long-term efficacy and
safety of omalizumab, and to identify predictive factors
and optimum dosage regimens.

Methods

The study was approved by the Commission of Pharmacy and Therapeutics of our hospital and by
INFARMED (the authority for medication and health
products of the Portuguese national health system),
and all patients provided informed consent.

This was a_ prospective observational study of
patients with resistant CSU attending the Urticaria
Clinic at our Department of Dermatology (University
Hospital of Coimbra, Portugal) who were started on
omalizumab. Selected patients were aged > 18 years,
with severe CSU [defined as weekly urticaria activity
score (UAS7) > 28] unresponsive to second-generation
H1-antihistamines at up to four times the licensed
dose. CSU diagnosis was based on patient history and
clinical observation, and for CIndU, on provocation
tests as well.

We analysed patients’ demographic data, clinical
features of urticaria, laboratory parameters and previous therapies. Skin biopsies and extended laboratory
analysis, including C-reactive protein (CRP), total IgE,
antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and _ anticytoplasmic
antibodies, and thyroid auto-immunity and function.
Occasionally, autologous serum skin test (ASST) was
performed to identify predictive factors for response.

Initial omalizumab dosage was 150 mg subcutaneiously 4 weeks. In case of no or incomplete
response, the dosage was increased to 300 mg every
4 (or if necessary every 3) weeks in cases of relapse

just prior to the next scheduled injection. In patients
who achieved complete and sustained response, the
dose was tapered or the interval between administrations was extended until the optimum dosage schedule
was obtained.

Efficacy was assessed using weekly urticaria activity
score (UAS7), and outcomes were classified as complete (UAS7 =0), partial (UAS7 = 0-28), or no
response (UAS7 > 28). In CIndU, efficacy was assessed
by subjective clinical response.

Results

Patients

Demographics and baseline clinical and laboratory
characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The study
enrolled 13 patients (11 women, 2 men; mean age
49.3 + 16.2 years, range 21-78) with severe CSU.
Mean UAS7 was 36.3 + 5.4 years (range 28-42),
average disease duration was 9.4 + 10.1 years (range
1-36), and average disease onset was 39.8 + 18.6
years (range 13-68).

 

 

 

Symptoms and previous treatments

All patients had experienced angio-oedema; 7 patients
also had concurrent DPU, and 1 had SU. All had previously received >2 treatments (mean 3.3 + 0.9;
range 2—5) other than anti-H1, including mainly short
courses of corticosteroids (n= 13),  ciclosporin
(n = 12) and montelukast (n = 8), but either had been
unresponsive or had been forced to discontinue treatment due to adverse events (AEs).

Omalizumab treatment

Overall, there were 189 administrations of omalizumab
(mean 14.6 + 9.5 treatments/patient: range 2-29)
during the treatment periods (range 2-38 months).
The dosage regimens and treatment responses are summarized in Table 2. We observed positive responses for
both CSU and CIndU in 12 (92.3%) patients, of whom
4 (30.8%) showed complete response (CR) and 8
(61.5%) showed partial response (PR). One patient
(7.7%) failed to show improvement, and treatment was
discontinued after four administrations.

 

Outcome

In the four patients showing CR, two achieved CR at a
dosage of 150 mg every 4 weeks, whereas the other

two tolerated the interval being lengthened to
5 weeks, but not to 6 weeks. In one patient, dosage
was reduced to 75 mg every 4 weeks, but recurrence
of urticaria ensued.

Of the four patients who had CR, two needed only one
administration (with CR occurring within 48 h in one
case), while the remaining two had CR after three and
six administrations, respectively. After the first administration, UAS7 decreased to a mean value of 29.3 + 6.1
(range 22.5—37) for these four patients, and medication
was discontinued in three patients when CR was sustained, after 9, 10 and 12 administrations, respectively.
Subsequently, only one patient remained disease-free, as
relapse ensued in the other two, but similar CR recurred
in these two patients upon re-introduction of the previous dosage. Overall, the urticaria was under control in
three patients following 21, 28 and 29 administrations,
respectively, even though all three chose to discontinue
all their other CSU medication.

Among the patients with PR (n = 8), four responded
to 150 mg every 4 weeks, whereas the other four
required 300 mg at intervals of 5 weeks (n= 1),
4 weeks (n = 2) or 3 weeks (n = 1). In this group of
patients, UAS7 decreased to this mean value of
19.6 + 11.5 (range 0-37) after the first administration. In one patient, the condition was well controlled
(UAS7-0-6) after eight administrations at 300 mg
every 5 weeks. Five patients with spontaneous urticaria had mild symptoms (UAS7 <16, with occasional
need for anti-H1) and five patients with physical urticaria (four delayed pressure and one SU) improved on
dosages of 300 mg every 4 weeks (n=1) and
150 mg every 4 weeks (n = 4). In two patients, the
disease was partially controlled with 300 mg every 3
or 4 weeks, but both experienced short periods of
unexplained aggravation for 1 or 2 months (UAS7
> 20), followed by PR thereafter, and both required
rescue medication with very short courses of oral, corticosteroids and anti-H1. In one of these patients a
single dose increase of omalizumab to 450 mg was
effective in re-establishing control of CSU.

One patient showed no response to omalizumab
after four administrations, even at 300 mg (UAS7
> 28 during treatment); however, 4 months after stopping the drug, her urticaria (which had been constant
for 36 years) resolved, and she remained completely
clear during a follow-up of 30 months.

 

 

Epidemiological data

There were no significant differences in sex or age
between patients with differing outcomes. The patient

6 Clinical and Experimental Dermatology

with longest disease duration (36 years) was the nonresponder to omalizumab, but other patients with
long-established disease responded positively (including
CR) and there was no significant difference in disease
duration between patients with PR and those with CR
(4.9 + 14.4 years and 5.0 + 23.7, respectively).

All patients had severe disease at baseline, with no
significant differences in UAS7 (UAS7: 42 + 0 in no
response; 36.1 + 5.7 in PR; 35.3 + 5.1 in CR). No
significant differences were found in baseline CRP or
IgE between the different response groups.

 

 

 

 

 

Serological evidence of autoimmunity

In the CR group, all four patients were positive for
ANAs and additionally, one had anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO) and one had a positive
ASST result, while in the PR group, three had ANAs,
one had anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies and one
had anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase II antibodies.
The patient who showed no response was positive for
ASST, antigastric parietal cell antibodies and anti-TPO.
Eosinophils in infiltrate were predominantly found in
the PR group (n= 4), but also in the CR group
(n= 1) and in the nonresponse patient. Histological
findings showed minor vascular aggression in the nonresponse patient, but also in one patient with PR and
one with CR.

Adverse events

We observed only two AEs possibly associated with
omalizumab. The patient with no response reported a
mild headache after the second administration of omalizumab 300 mg. In addition, one of the PR group
reported aggravation of urticaria with malaise and
fever approximately 6-12 h after receiving omalizumab 300 mg, but symptoms cleared in 24-48 h
and did not recur after the following administration,
which was performed on an inpatient basis.

Discussion

This was an observational study, limited by the small
sample size and variable number of treatments, but
with treatment periods of > 3 years, which is longer
than most previous reports. We observed long-lasting
improvement in CSU at rates similar to clinical trials
lasting a few months**® and to other retrospective
studies.*!! We also observed symptomatic relief in
delayed pressure urticaria and SU in patients who presented these types of CIndU associated with their CSU.

Omalizumab for chronic spontaneous urticaria ¢ M. Pinto Gouveia et al.

In agreement with our results, DPU and symptomatic
dermographism have been reported to be particularly
sensitive to omalizumab,’ and the drug may also be a
potentially interesting treatment for SU.'*

With the limited number of patients in our study,
we did not find any clinical or laboratory factors predicting response to omalizumab treatment. Improvement in disease control seemed to be independent of
age, sex, previous therapies, disease severity (baseline
UAS7), CRP, pretreatment IgE level, histopathological
findings and serological evidence of autoimmunity.

According to previous studies, some patients treated
with omalizumab experience rapid onset of symptom
control, as soon as 24-48 h after start of treatment
(rapid responders),”°"!? which cannot be explained by
a reduction in density of IgE receptors, but could be
via removal of soluble IgE and auto-allergen sequestration.'* Furthermore, in our study, we found that initial response did not correlate with long-term
response, as there was no significant difference in
immediate improvement (i.e. decrease in UAS7 scores)
between CR and PR.

This long-term experience suggests that, despite providing effective symptom control or relief, omalizumab
does not alter the natural course of the disease, which
is characterized by spontaneous remission and exacerbation. Patients who discontinued treatment developed
UAS7 scores similar to their baseline, which accords
with the findings of previous studies.*'* Only one
patient had disease remission after sustained CR, but it
is not certain this was due to omalizumab rather than
to spontaneous resolution. Similarly, we observed that
symptoms worsened at suboptimal dosages for each
patient, but response was restored when the previous
dosage was reinstated. These findings support those of
other studies,*!° confirming both on-demand and regular treatment as viable management options.

In this study, we found that omalizumab was capable of controlling symptoms for long periods; however, patients cases displayed marked fluctuations in
response despite being maintained on the same dose,
and such an unexplained fluctuation has not been
described in previous reports. This response profile
seems not to be due to loss of drug efficacy, as the
patients responded to further administrations, but
rather to natural exacerbations of the disease, which
may occasionally require higher doses.

Omalizumab also has a good safety profile, with the
majority of AEs being mild or moderate.*"° The symptoms following omalizumab administration, reported by
one patient with angio-oedema and urticaria aggravation, have been described and eventually misattributed

© 2017 British Association of Dermatologists

to anaphylaxis.'? Nevertheless, contrary to anaphylaxis,
the symptoms in the present study were slow to develop
and did not repeat on subsequent exposure, therefore
were attributed mainly to aggravation of the disease just
prior to the next dose of omalizumab taking effect.

Currently, there is no detailed information on optimum dosages of omalizumab for urticaria. We had
with the following treatment schedules:
150 mg every 5 weeks; 150mg every 4 weeks;
300 mg every 5 weeks; 300 mg every 4 weeks; and
300 mg every 3 weeks.

Although clinical trials point to 300 mg every
4 weeks,’ and some recent studies even advocate
300 mg every 2 weeks,!° we consider it reasonable to
start with 150 mg every 4 weeks and to increase the
dose if patients do not respond, as reported in another
real-life study.'” In practice, some patients may even
benefit from dosages greater than 300 mg every
3 weeks,''!® as observed in one of our patients. Dose
intervals can also be adjusted, making them more frequent if urticaria activity increases just prior to the
next administration, or extending the interval to
achieve the minimum effective dosage in cases where
CR is achieved. Although not usually reported,
throughout treatment, the dosage may eventually
require adjustment due to disease worsening. Treatment should then be maintained until symptoms are
controlled, after which discontinuations should be
attempted since spontaneous remissions may occur.

In our experience, omalizumab might provide an
effective option for long-term management of severe
CSU and some CIndU. Our results also suggest that
dose and administration interval should be individualized in order to improve each patient's response. However, further studies are required to investigate the
need for individualization and the best way to make
these adjustments.

What's already known about this topic?

* Omalizumab is a valid and safe treatment for
recalcitrant chronic spontaneous urticaria and
many cases of chronic inducible urticaria.

 

 

What does this study add?

+ Individualized omalizumab dose and interval
might be beneficial for long-term management of
CSU.
