Abstract
Background: The pathogenesis of chronic spontaneous urticaria involves interp!

ay between the

genetic and environmental factors, most of which is still poorly understood. It is well-recognized

urticaria (CAU); that 30-40% of chronic spontaneous urticaria is autoimmune in nature. Chronic autoimmune

FceR1B (Fc epsilon 4 oy lw . .
receptor | beta); mast cell and basophil activation, thereby giving rise to the release of histamine

Autologous serum flammatory mediators. We investigated the association between SNP loci in Fee!
skin test (ASST) spontaneous urticaria and to see its relation with serum IgE levels in Kashmiri

urticaria is caused by anti-FceR1B and less frequently, by anti-IgE auto antibodies that lead to

and other proinR18 and chronic
population.

Methods: The autologous serum skin test was used as a screening test for chronic autoimmune

urticaria. PCR-RFLP was used to detect the genotype of the SNP loci. Serum
assessed by ELISA kit.

Results: No significant difference was found between the study population and
genotype distribution (wild and variant) among FceR1 loci (P value =0.06, od

IgE levels were

control group in
ds ratio =0.29).

 

The frequency of FceR18 (C109T) in autologous serum skin test positive chronic autoimmune
urticaria patients with the CT genotype was found to be statistically non-significant when

compared with the wild genotype (P=0.35). Carriers of FceR1B (T allele) hada
risk of developing CAU than those with C allele (P=0.01). In our population

more significant
serum total IgE

levels did not find any statistical significance with regard to ASST positive & ASST negative

patients (P=0.26).

Introduction disulphide-linked gamma chains.° While the genes for the

Urticaria involves the superficial portion of the dermis,
presenting as well-circumscribed wheal with erythematous raised serpeginous borders and blanched centers that
may coalesce to become giant wheals. Chronic urticaria is
one of most common chronic inflammatory disorder prevalent in our society, defined as urticaria persisting daily or
almost daily for more than six weeks. Chronic urticaria
causes deterioration of quality of life.' It includes physical
urticaria, cholinergic urticaria, chronic idiopathic urticaria
and urticarial vasculitis. Up to 55% of the patients with
chronic urticaria have an idiopathic cause. In recent years
a significant number of patients (30-40%) with CSU have
been reported to have an autoimmune basis for their disease
including autoantibodies to IgE (5-10%) or, more commonly,
to the (a-chain) of FceR1 (35-45%).? These autoantibodies
have been shown to activate blood basophils and cutaneous
mast cells in vitro, with enhancement of basophil activation by complement and release of C5a. Unfortunately
antibody binding tests (viz. ELISA) can yield positive tests
in many autoimmune diseases, normal subjects, or patients
with other forms of urticaria, but most such sera are nonunctional and cannot be used to diagnose CAU. At this
point of time, gold standard for detecting clinically relevant
autoantibodies to FceR1 is functional in vitro donor basophil
histamine release assay (BHRA) and their specificity is confirmed by immunoassay (Western blot or ELISA), where these
tests are available.’
In autologous serum skin test (ASST), autologous serum
injected into patients own skin can induce a wheal and
flare reaction involving mast cell activation, and removal
of the antibody leads to remission.* CAU has been reported
to occur in children as well.° It is often not possible to distinguish CAU from those without autoantibodies, clinically or
histologically. The ASST is used as a screening test. Grattan
et al., reported that the histological features of a positive
ASST resemble an IgE-mediated late phase reaction.° The
ASST is a useful tool for picking up patients with circulating
wheal producing factors in CSU. However, its specificity as a
screening test for presence of functional anti-FceR1 is moderate while the sensitivity is high enough to safely exclude
autoimmune urticaria and confirmation by demonstration of
histamine-releasing activity in the patient’s serum may be
needed for establishing this diagnosis.

To release histamine from mast cells, the key step is
a cross-linking of allergens with IgE, which is bound with
the FceR18 located on their surface.’ The receptor is a
tetrameric complex composed of an alpha, a beta and two

 

 

alpha and gamma subunits are both located on human chromosome 1,’ the beta gene is located on 11q13 and spans
about 10kb and contains 7 exons.'° Histamine release via
autoantibodies against FceR1B was noted in the pathogenic
mechanism of CSU.''? Several investigators demonstrated
a positive association of gene polymorphism of the B chain
of FceR18 with high serum total IgE level, atopy or the
asthma phenotype.'*-'> In this study, we analyzed known
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of FceR1B in CSU
patients, compared with other ASST positive CAU and in normal healthy controls in Kashmiri population. Furthermore
we observed association of ASST positive CAU with serum
total IgE levels.

Methods and materials

The study included 120 patients of CSU and equal number of
healthy controls. These patients were enrolled by the allergy
clinic of department of Immunology and Molecular Medicine,
Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), Srinagar, India. All the subjects were native, with normal
controls having no history of allergy, atopy, drug hypersensitivity or family history of urticaria. All the subjects were
recruited from the general population and informed consent
was taken, which was then approved by SKIMS ethical committee. CSU was defined as the daily or near daily presence
of pruritic wheal for more than 6 weeks without underlying
etiology. Autologous serum skin test (ASST) was performed
by injecting autologous serum intradermal to volar aspect
of same patient’s forearm, and the injected skin was examined for wheal formation 30 min later. Positive and negative
controls with intradermal histamine and saline injections
were carried out on the adjacent skin. The test was considered positive if the serum induced wheal was at least
1.5mm greater than the saline wheal, (Fig. 1). The form of
urticaria with positive ASST is characterized as autoreactive.
In all the subjects, serum total IgE levels were estimated by
performing Enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) kit (Fortress
diagnostics, UK) following manufacturer’s protocol.

SNP genotyping for allele frequencies of the
candidate gene

Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood using
phenol-chloroform method. Polymerase chain reaction
restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was
applied to detect the genotype of SNP loci, The reference

Labs, S.A.), 5 pmol of each primer (Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals
Pvt. Ltd., India), and 10ng of genomic DNA. The negative
control was used to monitor contamination. Cycling conditions included 1 cycle at 95°C for 5min, 40 cycles at 95°C
for 30s, annealing temperature for 45s, 72°C for 1 min, and
a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. PCR-amplified products
were detected by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2a).
One sample was not included in the study due to the nonamplification of the candidate gene. A restriction enzyme
(Tru91) with restriction site TGAA > TTAA was used to digest
the PCR products of the loci. A 10-L reaction mixture
containing 5 units of restriction enzyme and 5-yL of PCR
Products was incubated for 16h. Digested products were
run on 2.5% agarose (High EEO, Highmedia Labs, India) in
1x TAE buffer. The electrophoresis was carried out at 80V

CT as heterozygous variant.

Statistical analysis

Differences in genotype distribution between the experimental and control group were analyzed using x? Test. A P
value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant.
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version
13.0 (Chicago, USA).

Results

In this study 120 CSU patients and equal number of healthy
controls were included. The clinical characteristics of study
subjects are summarized in Table 2. The age of patients
ranged from 7 to 65 years, the mean age was 28 years with
females out-numbering males, 11:1 ratio. Atopy was found
in 12% of patients, 32% patients revealed the history of allergic disease, 94% patients were having pruritic rashes. As far
as the total serum IgE in patients is concerned, the patients
were divided into two groups. Those having the total IgE
concentration of <100IU/mL (group |) and group II having the total IgE concentration of >1001IU/mL. In the group
|, 48% (n=7) patients were ASST positive and 52% (n=9)
patients were ASST negative. In the group Il, 58% (n=61)
patients were ASST positive and 42% (n=43) patients were
ASST negative. Thus, total IgE levels in ASST positive and
negative patients varied; there existed no statistical significance in total IgE levels between ASST positive and ASST
negative patients among the two groups (P=0.26, OR=0.54,
95% Cl=0.16-1.77) as shown in Table 3.

Effect of the SNP loci

Statistically non-significant differences (P>0.05) were
found between the cases and the control group (C/C genotype) in the genotype distribution of FceR18 C109T in loci
(Table 4). In our study, we found the frequency of C/C
genotype was 69.74% (n=83), T/T genotype was 26.89%
(n=32) and that of CT was 3.36% (n=04) in cases, where
as it was 77.5% (n=93), 15.83% (n=19) and 6.66% (n=08)
in healthy controls, respectively. The frequency of FceR1B
C109T, T/T genotype in the ASST +ve CIU group was found
statistically non-significant with that of the control group

the CT genotype was found to be statistically non-significant
when compared with the wild genotype (P=0.35, OR=0.56,
95% Cl=0.13-2.15).

Also, it was seen that Carriers of FceR1f (T allele) had
a more significant risk of developing CAU than those with
C allele (P=0.01, OR=0.6, 95% Cl=0.37-0.92) as shown in
Table 4.

Discussion

We investigated single SNP of FceR18 gene that might be
associated with CSU pathogenesis, further we analyzed the
association of total serum IgE levels with the ASST positive
CSU patients. In the present study, no significant differences
were found in the allele and genotype frequencies of SNP,
thereby suggesting that the high affinity receptor gene polymorphisms may not be related to the development of CSU
phenotype in our population. The high affinity IgE receptor
is responsible for initiating allergic response. The binding of
an allergen to the receptor bound IgE leads to mast cell activation and the release of histamine, which are responsible
for clinical manifestations of urticaria.'”

Polymorphisms of the FcsR18 gene have been reported
to be associated with the atopy, total serum IgE level,
bronchial hyper responsiveness, asthma and the basophilic
histamine-releasing activity of asthmatic patients. '°-'° Since
no previous study has been made on the association of
FceR18 gene polymorphisms and urticaria, this study, therefore, is the first of its type to investigate whether there is
any significant association between the FceR1B gene polymorphism and the CSU phenotype in a Kashmiri population or
not. Also, autoimmunity against the high affinity IgE receptor has been reported in chronic urticaria and CAU.'®"! In the
present study, we found no significant associations between
the SNPs of FceR18 gene and CSU, however, in this study,
serum total IgE levels were found varied to different ranges
in CAU patients and most of ASST positive CSU patients were
found to have high levels of serum total IgE.

Thus we conclude that there is no statistically significant association between FceR1B gene polymorphism and
CSU in Kashmiri population; however, there is a probability of developing CSU in patients carrying FceR18 T allele.

Furthermore, serum total IgE levels had no significant association with the development of CAU.
