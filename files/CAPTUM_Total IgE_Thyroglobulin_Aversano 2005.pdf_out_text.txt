Improvement of chronic idiopathic urticaria with L-thyroxine:

a new TSH role in immune response?

Background: The association between chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) and
autoimmune thyroiditis (AT) is known, as well as major prevalence of antithyroid antibodies in the allergical subjects and other autoimmune diseases. We
have evaluated the effects of L-thyroxine on clinical symptoms of CIU in AT
patients suggesting the hypothesis of a new thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
role in immune system.

Methods: In 20 female patients with CIU + AT, both hypothyroid and euthyroid, we have investigated the therapeutic effects of L-thyroxine dosed to suppress the TSH. Free-T3, Free-T4, TSH, antithyroperoxidase and
antithyroglobulin antibodies, total immunoglobulin (Ig)E, Rheuma test and
eritro-sedimentation rate were monitored during treatment.

Results: In 16 patients a strong decrease of urticaria symptoms has happened
after 12 weeks. The TPO Ab and HTG Ab clearly decreased in 14 patients.
Furthermore, in two patients with rheumatoid arthritis and in two patients with
pollen allergy a strong decrease of rheuma test titer and total IgE has happened.
Conclusion: The reason of AT is associated to CIU and others allergical and
autoimmune diseases is poorly known. The exclusive hormonal therapy reduces
the symptoms of CIU and inflammatory response in many chronic diseases
associated to AT. We suggest a stimulatory effect of TSH able to produce
considerable changes of the immune response and immune tolerance in patients
with AT causing target organs damage.The causal mechanism involves immune,
nervous and endocrine system, sharing a common set of hormones, cytokines
and receptors, in a unique totally integrated loop (the neuro-immuno-endocrine
axis).

It is well known since ancient times that alterations of
psycho-physical state may condition the biological organism response. Galeno, 2000 years ago, described the
existence of relationships between immune function and
emotional state.

Infective, inflammatory, surgical or other stress, in
living organism initiate a number of complementary
events involving the immune, nervous and endocrine
system. Physiological studies seem to indicate that the
pituitary gland plays a unique role in the physiologic
integration of the neuro-immuno-endocrine axis. The
pituitary, as the producer of throphic hormones, such
as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), ACTH, HPRL,
GH, etc., regulates many endocrine and nonendocrine
target tissues (1-4). The cytokines [Interleukines (IL),
Monokines, etc.] secreted by immune cells, acting as
humoral signs, may communicate to the neuro—endocrine
system by a regulatory feedback loop (1-5).

The association between chronic idiopathic urticaria
(CIU) [duration longer than 6 weeks (6)] and autoimmune

thyroiditis (AT) (hypothyroid, euthyroid or hyperthyroid)
is known long before, as well as major prevalence of
antithyroid antibodies in the allergical subjects and
the other autoimmune diseases, compared with healthy
(7-16).

An autoimmunity disorder is often indicated like
common reason of CIU, AT and other diseases associated with them.

Aim of study

The aims of our study have been: to evaluate the effects
of hormonal therapy with L-thyroxine on clinical
symptoms of CIU and other chronic inflammatory
disease in patient with AT; to suggest a new hypothesis, according to the symptoms improvement is
strictly linked to the TSH suppression able to produce
considerable changes of the immune tolerance and
immune response.

Materials and methods

We have selected 20 female patients with CIU + AT. Patients with
AT had antithyroglobulin or antithyroperoxidase antibody levels
> 250 IU/ml from more than 6 months. The food skin prick test
were negative in all subjects. The patients have been subdivided in
two groups: eight hypothyroid (40%) with elevated TSH (>5 IU/
ml); 12 (60%) euthyroid with normal TSH (0.3-3.0 IU/ml).

Two hypothroid patients presented rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with
elevated rheuma test titer (> 100 IU/ml) and two patients pollen
allergy (PA) with elevated immunoglobulin (Ig)E (> 200 IU/ml).
One euthyroid was affected by RA with elevated rheuma test titer and
one PA with elevated IgE (Table 1).

We have treated the patients with increasing doses of L-thyroxine
until total suppression of TSH level (<0.3 IU/ml), that happened
about after 4 weeks.

Free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), TSH, thyroglobulin (HTG), antithyroperoxidase antibodies (AntiTPO Ab),
antithyroglobulin antibodies (AntiHTG Ab), total IgE, Rheuma
test and eritro-sedimentation rate (ESR) are controlled before and
during treatment. FT3, FT4, TSH, Anti-TPO Ab, AntiHTG Ab
were measured by Luminometric Assay, IgE by Enzyme Immuno
Assay, Rheuma test by Nephelometric method. All patients were
treated after 2 weeks of antihistamine washout. Clinical response
was evaluated by clinical score.

Presence of symptoms was scored daily on a diary card by the
patient, with a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (max) for erythema, wheals,
itching and interference with sleep. Clinical check was evaluated
every 4 weeks for 3 months.

Statistical analysis

We used Student’s /-test for paired samples to calculate P-values
related to blood tests and clinical score. The comparison was
with values before the start of therapy. P-value of <0.05 was
considered to indicate statistical significance. All P-values were
two-tailed.

Results

In 16 (80%) patients (all eight patients with hypothyroidism) a strong decrease of urticaria symptoms has happened
after 12 weeks. The AntiHTG Ab are significantly
decreased when compared before and after treatment
(401.8 + 339.2 vs 199.0 + 204.1; P = 0.0016), also AntiTPO Ab (840.7 + 900.8 vs 366.7 + 501.3; P = 0.0010)

(Table 2).

Two patients reported an improvement with poor
decrease of antithyroid antibodies, while four euthyroid
patients showed poor improvement within 12 weeks with
persistent elevated antibodies. The clinical score showed a
significant improvement of all symptoms as itching
(2.150 + 0.587 vs 1.000 + 0.324; P < 0.0001), erythema
(1.100 + 0.447 vs 0.200 + 0.410; P < 0.0001), wheals
(0.350 + 0.489 vs 0.000 + 0.000; P = 0.0047) and interference with sleep (1.300 + 0.571 vs 0.600 + 0.503;
P < 0.0001) (Table 3).

We have observed an important correlation between
clinical improvement and decrease of ESR values and
antithyroid antibodies levels.

Two patients had a recurrence of symptoms after a
spontaneous stopping treatment, which resolved after
treatment was restarted. Furthermore, in two patients
with rheumatoid arthritis and in two with PA, both with
hypothiroidism, we have observed improvement of symptoms with a strong decrease of rheuma test titer and total
IgE, although the decrease of rheuma test titer has not

Discussion

It is already clearly documented the bidirectional relation
between immune and neuro-endocrine system. The two
systems are a totally integrated loop, sharing a common
set of hormones, cytokines and receptors (1, 2, 4~5, 7-17).

Several cytokines [IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNFa, INFy,
Thimic hormones, leukotrienes (LT), prostaglandins
(PG), etc.] are able to modulate the secretion and the
release of hormones by hypothalamus, pituitary and
peripheral tissues, where specific receptors for these
cytokines are present (1-4, 18-19).

On the contrary, immune cells [T and B lymphocytes,
dendritic cells (APC), monocytes, thymocytes and splenocytes] express receptors for various kinds of messengers,
such as: hormones (TRH, TSH, ACTH, GH, HPRL, sex
hormone, corticosteroids), neuro-transmitters, cytokines,
growth factors modulating their trophism and cytokines
secretion (1-4).

Several authors have documented in their studies:

1. the expression of TSH, TRH, HPRL and other
hormone receptors on the cellular components of
the immune system (1-4),

inflammatory or
chronic disease

the capability of human peripheral mononuclear

cells, monocytes, splenocytes to release a high

amount of TSH treated with TRH (1, 2, 4),

3. the expression of cytokines receptors (especially
IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNFa, INFy, LT, PG) in CNS
hypothalamic—pituitary axis with TRH-TSH inhibitory effects and CRH-ACTH stimulatory effects
(1-4, 17, 18, 20-22) and

4. the proof of TSH (dose-dependent) and also HPRL

stimulatory effect on the interleukines(IL-1, IL-2,

IL-6, IL-12) and other messengers release by

lymphocytes and dendritic cells (especially IL-2),

involved in the amplification of immune response.

IL-2 has shown multiple immunoregolatory prop
erties. It is known as a major T cell growth factor,

enhances natural killer cell (NK) and lymphokine
actived killer cell (LAK) activities (2-4, 23-26).

These evidences suggest that TSH has many of qualities
of a cytokine and can regulate the immune response
mainly by a direct T cell, B cell and dendritic cell
activation (2-4, 27, 28). This stimulatory effect, amplified
in AT patients, determines the continual release in
circulation of various interleukines and cytokines (especially IL-2) by immune cells both of inflamed thyroid and
other tissues, that could cause an inflammatory state of
target organs such as skin, muscles, nervous system,
heart, joints, eyes and bone marrow.

These data suggest that the IL and other cytokine
receptors of CNS hypothalamic—pituitary axis could be
normally the central site of a long feedback between
cytokines and TSH (Fig. 1).

In many diseases or situations of inflammatory and
noninflammatory stress (cardiac, renal, postsurgical, etc.)

References

with healthy thyroid (nonthyroidal illness, euthyroid sick
syndrome), this feed-back determines a (29-32) decrease
of TSH and FT3, because of inhibition of hypothalamic—
pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis (Fig. 2A) and at same time
the stimulation of hypothalamic—pituitary—adrenal
(HPA) axis.

While in same patients with also AT, both hypothyroid
(TSH increase) and euthyroid (inclined to increase TSH —
subclinical hypothyroidism), the stimulation of TSH and
also HPRL towards cytokines overcomes the inhibition
of cytokines towards TSH, mainly because of thyroid
hormones deficit (Fig. 2B). This altered feedback could
cause CIU and other organs damage by means of
immuno-tolerance alteration.

 

Conclusion

Many clinical and experimental studies and also our
observations suggest an important association between
the CNS-hypothalamic—pituitary-thyroid function and
the immune state. Therefore, the thyroid functionality
and antithyroid antibodies, including antiTSH-receptor
Ab, should be evaluated in all patients with CIU and
other autoimmune or chronic inflammatory diseases. The
thyroid hormonal therapy, mainly by a TSH suppression,
can result effective to reduce the symptoms of CIU and
inflammatory response in many chronic disease associated to AT in hypothyroid and euthyroid patients (3335).

Further studies are required to evaluate the role of the
other CNS-hypothalamic—pituitary hormones involved
in immune response.
