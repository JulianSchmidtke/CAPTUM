Abstract

Background: Elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a sensitive marker of
inflammation, have been consistently reported in chronic spontaneous urticaria.
Here, we retrospectively analyzed data from 1,253 CSU patients from two centers to
answer the following questions: 1) What is the prevalence of elevated levels of CRP
in CSU? 2) Why do CSU patients show elevated levels of CRP? 3) Are elevated

CRP levels relevant?

Methods: Serum levels of CRP were measured by the nephelometric method. We
collected information regarding various laboratory tests including ESR, CBC with
differential, D-dimer, fibrinogen, C3, C4, IL-6 etc. For most patients, we also
collected data on age, gender, duration of CSU, presence of angioedema, activity
(UAS at the time of blood sampling and for 7 days), quality of life (CU-Q2oL and/or
DLQI), comorbidities and possible causes of CSU, and autologous serum skin test
(ASST) response. The efficacy of second generation antihistamines was evaluated

at the day of blood collecting.

Results: One third of CSU patients had elevated levels of CRP. Higher levels of
CRP were associated with ASST positivity (p=0.009) and arterial hypertension
(p=0.005), but not with other possible causes or comorbidities of CSU. CRP
correlated with urticaria activity (p<0.001), quality of life impairment (p=0.026),
inflammatory and coagulation markers (p<0.001). CRP levels were significantly

higher in non-responders to antihistamines as compared to responders (p<0.001).

Conclusion: Elevated levels of CRP are common and relevant in CSU patients. The
assessment of CRP levels may help to optimize the management of patients with
CSU.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a multifactorial mast cell-dependent
inflammatory disease, characterized by recurrent itchy wheals and/or angioedema.
Several immunological events have been described in CSU, including mast cell
activation and degranulation, the activation of coagulation and acute phase response
(1-4). In a recently published review, we identified several potential disease-related
biomarkers including D-dimer, matrix metalloproteinase-9 and C-reactive protein
(CRP) that can reflect these processes and are supported by strong evidence for
distinguishing CSU patients from healthy controls (2). Elevated levels of CRP have
been consistently reported in CSU patients (2, 5-7).

CRP is produced by the liver during an inflammatory reaction and is a sensitive
serum marker for inflammation. CRP is elevated in various disorders including

infections, cancer, autoimmune, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases (8-10).

Measuring CRP values has been proved useful in determining disease activity,
prognosis or efficacy of treatment. For example, in Crohn's disease, acute
pancreatitis (8) and psoriasis (11) high CRP levels indicate more active disease.
Moreover, correlation between CRP and other inflammatory markers such as
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) has been reported (10). ESR is another well
known non-specific marker of inflammation. In contrast to ESR, CRP is not or less
likely to be affected by other factors such as size, shape and number of red blood
cells, female sex and pregnancy as is ESR (12). Furthermore, CRP levels respond
more quickly to inflammatory processes. Also, false negative and false positive
results are less common for CRP than ESR (12). Because of this, CRP is considered

to be a better indicator of inflammation than ESR.

According to the recently revised EAACI/GA7LEN/EDF/WAO guideline for urticaria,
CRP assessment is recommended in all patients with chronic urticaria and may help
in its diagnosis and differential diagnosis (1). Furthermore, CRP has been proposed
as a possible biomarker of CSU activity/severity (2) and the response of CSU
patients to treatment (7). Nevertheless, evidence and data in support of these
recommendations are scarce and conflicting. Here, we analyzed data from a large
international and multicentric cohort of CSU patients to answer the following
questions: 1) What is the prevalence of elevated levels of CRP in CSU? 2) Why do

CSU patients show elevated levels of CRP? 3) Are elevated CRP levels relevant?

Materials and Methods
Study population

In this study, we retrospectively evaluated data from 1,253 CSU patients (Table 1)
from the urticaria specialty clinics of the dermatological departments of Charité Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Germany (n=1,023) and |.M. Sechenov First Moscow
State Medical University, Russia (n=230). We did not seek informed consent or
ethical committee approval for our study because our analysis looked retrospectively
at a large cohort of patients and we did not use identifiable patient information. All
data were pseudonymized. Based on the current EAACI/GA*LEN/EDF/WAO

guideline for urticaria, CSU was defined as persistent recurrent whealing,

angioedema, or both reoccurring for >6 weeks due to known or unknown causes (1).
Patients with chronic inducible urticaria only and urticarial vasculitis were excluded.
Less than 10% of the examined subjects had taken any oral corticosteroids or

antidepressants within 4 weeks before the study.
Blood collection and analysis

Blood was drawn and analyzed for routine patient care. From the patients’ files, we
collected information regarding the following laboratory tests (Suppl. Table 1): CRP;
ESR; complete blood count (CBC) including: erythrocytes, leukocytes, neutrophils,
basophils, eosinophils, thrombocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, red cell distribution
width; D-dimer, fibrinogen; complement C3, C4; total serum iron, ferritin; interleukin 6
(IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF); total serum IgE; IgA, IgG, IgM; IgG-anti-TPO,
IgG-anti-TG, IgE-anti-TPO; rheumafactor (RF); antinuclear antibodies (ANA);
eosinophil cationic protein (ECP); and antistreptolysin O antibodies (ASLO). The
methodologies were the same for most parameters from both centers and the normal
/ reference ranges and units of measure were the same. Some parameters (for
example, antinuclear antibodies) were calculated separately for both centers and
were not combined due to different methodology. Some tests were performed only in

one of the centers.
CRP determination

Serum CRP concentration was measured by the nephelometric method (BNproSpec, Dade-Behring, Marburg, Germany) in the local central laboratories of both

involved centers. Elevated serum CRP was defined as 25.0 mg/L.
Clinical parameter

For most patients, we also collected data on age, gender, duration of CSU, presence
of concomitant angioedema, comorbidities and possible causes of CSU (Table 2).
Comorbidities were assessed if these diseases were in the past and ongoing and
were grouped into 10 groups: 1) autoimmune diseases (such as Hashimoto's
thyroiditis, Graves’ disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, vitiligo, celiac disease,
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, endometriosis,
pernicious anemia, autoimmune hepatitis); 2) allergic diseases (including asthma,

allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, food

allergy); 3) oncology (breast cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, thyroid cancer,
melanoma); 4) pulmonary diseases (including COPD and chronic bronchitis); 5)
gastrointestinal diseases (gastritis, diverticulosis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis,
gastrointestinal reflux disease); 6) thyroid diseases (hypo- and hyperthyroidism); 7)

arterial hypertension; 8) depression; 9) anxiety; and 10) NSAIDs intolerance.

Patients were grouped into possible causes of their disease after review of their
patient chart and by a physician specialized in the treatment of urticaria. Patients
were group into: 1) idiopathic urticaria (no underlying cause identified); 2)
autoreactive urticaria (assessed by autologous serum skin test, ASST+); 3) CSU
associated with underlying infection (including parasitic infection and bacterial
infections, e.g. of the teeth, the tonsils); 4) CSU associated with food intolerance
(assessed by anamnesis, histamine provocation and/or elimination diet). In some

patients, more than one possible underlying cause was identified (Table 2).

Disease activity was determined using the urticaria activity score (UAS) which was
calculated as the sum of the itch and the hive score for 1 (UAS, minimum = 0;
maximum = 6) and/or 7 consecutive days (UAS7, minimum = 0, maximum = 42)
before blood analysis as follows: no wheals = 0, <20 wheals/24 h = 1, 20-50
wheals/24 h = 2, >50 wheals/24 h = 3 and pruritus intensity: no = 0, mild = 1,
moderate = 2, intense = 3 (1). UAS was measured in 752 CSU patients from both

centers and UAS7 was calculated in 759 CSU patients from Berlin.

Quality of life was assessed by use of the validated versions of Chronic Urticaria
Quality of Life questionnaire (CU-Q2oL) (13, 14) and/or the Dermatology Quality of
Life Index (DLQI) (15) at the time of blood sampling. The CU-Q2oL consists of 23
items grouped into 6 quality of life dimensions, where patients have to indicate, ona
Likert scale with multiple options (a range: from 1 — not at all to 5 — very much), how
much they have been troubled by each problem, with higher percentage scores

indicating better quality of life (13, 16).

There are 10 items in the DLQI in six subsections: symptoms and feelings, daily
activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships and treatment. The
questions in the form were replied as “not at all’, “a little’, “a lot” and “very much’,

with scores of 0, 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The DLQI is calculated by summing the

score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher

the score, the more quality of life is impaired (15).

Patient files were screened for ASST response. The ASST is a non-specific
screening test that evaluates the presence of serum histamine-releasing factor of
any type, including autoantibodies. The ASST is regarded positive if the serum wheal

is 21.5 mm as compared to negative control (17).

The efficacy of second generation antihistamines (sgAH) was evaluated at the day of
blood collecting (only in Moscow patients). Patients were asked how much they
suffered from CSU symptoms in the last four weeks (1 — very much, 2 — much, 3 —
somewhat, 4 — a little, 5 — not at all), how often the treatment for CSU was not
enough to control symptoms in the last four weeks (1 — very often, 2 — often, 3 —
sometimes, 4 — seldom, 5 — not at all) and how they considered an overall efficacy of
treatment (1 — not effective, 2 — poor response, 3 — good response, 4 — very good
response). Patients were regarded unresponsive to sgAH when they chose options
#1 and/or 2 for all three questions. If it was not the case, then CU-Q2oL scores were

taken into account before making the decision.
Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social
Science (IBM SPSS version 22.0; IBM Corp, New York, USA). Baseline
characteristics of cases were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The KolmogorovSmirnov test was used to evaluate the normal distribution of numerical variables.
Because data were not distributed normally, non-parametric tests were used.
Results are expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR). Correlations were
assessed by Spearman’s rank test. Categorical variables were compared between
groups by using the x2 test. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used for comparison
between the groups. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of
CRP to predict non-response to therapy of CSU with sgAH were calculated. P values

< 0.05 were considered significant.

Results

One third of CSU patients have elevated levels of CRP

Of the 1,019 CSU patients, 31% (n=313) had elevated levels of CRP (of 25 mg/L,
Table 1). CRP levels were linked, albeit weakly, with the age of the total CSU patient
population (Suppl. Table 2) and in the subgroup of patients with normal levels of
CRP, but not in the patient subgroup with elevated CRP level (data not shown). The
median CRP level of the patients with elevated levels was 10.6 mg/L (IQR: 6.4-16.6).
Patients with elevated and normal CRP were comparable regarding their gender and

presence of angioedema (Suppl. Table 3).

Higher levels of CRP are associated with ASST positivity and arterial hypertension

but not with other possible causes or comorbidities of CSU

Of 1,253 CSU patients, 74% (n=923) were investigated for possible causes of CSU
and 77% (n=967) for comorbid diseases, of which only autoreactive, i.e. ASSTpositive (ASST+) CSU and arterial hypertension were associated with high levels of
CRP (Table 2).

ASST+ CSU patients had significantly higher values of CRP than ASST-negative
(ASST-) patients (p=0.009, Table 2). Vice versa, patients with elevated CRP levels
(CRP+ patients) were significantly more frequently ASST+ than patients with normal
CRP levels (CRP- patients) (34.5% vs 27.9%, x2=3.864, p=0.049).

CSU patients with arterial hypertension had significantly higher CRP values as
compared to patients with normal blood pressure. Vice versa, CRP+ CSU patients
had significantly higher systolic blood pressure than CRP- CSU patients (Suppl.
Table 3). Moreover, we found a weak, but statistically significant correlation between
CRP levels and values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (Table 3). This
correlation was seen in the total CSU patient population and in CRP- patients, but

not in CRP+ patients.

CSU patients with food intolerance had significantly lower values of CRP as

compared to patients without food intolerance (Table 2).

CRP is correlated with urticaria activity and impact

CRP+ patients showed a slightly, but significantly shorter duration of disease and
significantly higher disease activity (UAS and UAS7) as compared to CRP- patients
(Suppl. Figure 1, Suppl. Table 3). CRP levels were highly correlated with urticaria
activity (UAS, Table 3, Suppl. Table 2) and QoL impairment as assessed by CUQ2oL (Table 3). In line with these results, the CRP+ patients had significantly higher
quality of life impairment as assessed by DLQI as compared to CRP- patients
(Suppl. Table 3).

CRP is associated with inflammatory and coagulation markers

CRP levels were correlated with other inflammatory markers such as ESR, blood
leukocyte/neutrophil counts (Figure 1), and IL-6 serum levels. Of the 825 CSU
patients, 19% had elevated levels of ESR (ESR+), and 11% of the 768 CSU patients
had both CRP and ESR levels elevated (CRP+/ESR+)(Table 1). Only one in 10
patients was CRP-/ESR+, 20% were CRP+/ESR-, and more than half of the patients
had normal values of both parameters (Table 1). Overall, CRP levels were more
often elevated than ESR levels, and ESR+ was only detectable in one third of the
CRP+ CSU patients (35% vs 57%, p<0.001).

CRP+ patients had significantly higher rates of IL-6, ferritin, leukocyte, thrombocyte,
neutrophil count and red cell distribution width and significantly lower hemoglobin,
iron and basophil and eosinophil counts than CRP- patients (Suppl. Table 3). CRP
also correlated with C3, C4, fibrinogen and D-dimer (Table 3, Figure 1), and CRP+
patients had significantly higher values of these parameters than CRP- patients
(Suppl. Table 3).

CRP+ and CRP- patients did not differ in terms of erythrocyte count, hematocrit,
tumor necrosis factor, total serum IgE, IgA, IgG, IgM, IgG-anti-TPO, IgG-anti-TG,
IgE-anti-TPO, rheumafactor, antinuclear antibodies, eosinophil cationic protein, and

antistreptolysin O antibodies.

CRP levels are associated with a poor response to second generation antihistamines

Non-responsiveness to therapy with sgAH in CSU patients in standard and elevated
doses (as defined by the criteria described in the Materials and Methods section)
was associated with elevated CRP serum levels (Table 4). Elevated CRP levels
allow to predict non-responsiveness to antihistamines in standard (p<0.001) or
elevated doses (p=0.023) in CSU patients with moderate specificity and moderatelow sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV)
that are listed in Table 4.

Discussion

This study shows, to our knowledge for the first time in a large multicentric cohort of
CSU patients, three important things: 1) CRP is linked to urticaria activity and with
inflammatory and coagulation markers; 2) high CRP levels are connected to ASST
positivity and arterial hypertension; 3) CRP levels are significantly higher in non
responders to antihistamines as compared to responders.

Our study confirms that elevated levels of CRP are common in patients with CSU.
Almost one third of our patients had elevated CRP levels, which is largely in line with
previous studies, where rates of elevated CRP in CSU have ranged from 17 to 23%
(18, 19). In comparison, elevated ESR levels were notably less common in our CSU
patients and in other studies (5), but not all (3). Most CSU patients with elevated
CRP did not have correspondingly elevated ESR, which is in line with one other
study (5).

There is strong evidence that CSU patients have significantly higher levels of CRP
compared to healthy controls (see Suppl. Table 4.1). Nevertheless, in other
dermatological diseases such as bullous pemphigoid (20) and urticaria vasculitis (21)

patients appear to have even higher levels of CRP than CSU patients.

Why do CSU patient show elevated levels of CRP? Our study shows that elevated
levels of CRP in a subpopulation of CSU patients are linked to CSU itself. In support
of this, we observed that CRP and urticaria activity and severity markers are linked.

Most previous studies (17 of 23; Suppl. Table 4.2) also found a significant

association between CSU activity/severity and blood levels of CRP. Moreover, CRP
correlated with other proposed CSU activity markers, namely D-dimer, MMP-9 and
IL-6 in most but not in all studies (Suppl. Table 4.4). This indicates that CRP levels
reflect CSU activity and that CRP may serve as a biomarker to monitor CSU

patients.

Interestingly, CRP+ patients and CRP- patients did not differ in autoimmune
markers, such as immunoglobulin subclasses, antinuclear, antithyroid or other
autoimmune antibodies (see Suppl. Table 3), suggesting that it is not a concomitant
autoimmune disease that triggers these elevated CRP levels. We also did not see a
correlation of elevated CRP levels and suspected underlying infection. This is in line
with one study, where elevated CRP levels were not associated with a history of

recent infection or overt comorbid inflammatory disease (5).

Furthermore, we did not find elevated CRP levels to be linked to possible causes of
CSU, except for autoreactivity, as assessed by ASST. Autoreactivity in CSU patients
was associated with elevated CRP, but not ESR. There are inconsistent results
between previous studies in regard to the correlation between ASST positivity and
high CRP levels (only 5 of 15 studies found such an association; Suppl. Table 4.3).
However, many studies, where this association was not observed, were from the
same authors and/or included less than 100 CSU patients. In CSU, autoreactivity
may aggravate the course of the disease via CSU-specific autoantibodies and/or
other still unknown factors. The known link between ASST positivity and higher UAS

scores supports this hypothesis.

There is strong evidence for decreased basophil counts in ASST+ CSU patients (2).
In confirmation of earlier findings (22), we found that basophil counts are lower in
CSU patients with elevated CRP compared to patients with normal CRP levels,
indicating that ASST+, CRP+, basopenia and high disease activity may be

interlinked and joint features of a CSU patient subgroup.

Another argument that the main reason for elevated CRP levels is the CSU itself is
the association between elevated CRP levels and shorter disease duration. This
suggests that CRP levels may be higher during early CSU, which is in agreement

with the current literature. CRP, in contrast to ESR, is recommended for monitoring

‘acute’ disease activity such as acute infection (eg, pneumonia, orbital cellulitis) (23).
Furthermore, acute urticaria patients are likely to have higher CRP levels as
compared to CSU patients (24). However, Kasperska-Zajac and co-workers did not
observe a significant correlation between CSU duration and CRP levels (4), possibly

because of the small number of CSU patients studied.

CRP levels in CSU patients are associated with blood pressure, which raises the
possibility that CSU, a chronic inflammatory disorder, can lead to the development of
arterial hypertension. Arguments in support of this theory include the association
between CSU and a higher risk of hypertension (25, 26) as reported by two recent
population-based retrospective studies. Expectedly, we also noticed a correlation
between age of CSU patients and blood pressure (data not shown). This can
explain, at least in part, a correlation between CRP and the age of our patients, also
seen in other studies (27) and in the general population (28), because increased age
is associated with a significant increase in the prevalence of hypertension (29). For
example, mean arterial pressure was not correlated with CRP levels in relatively
young patients with acute urticaria (30). The association of CSU with the risk of
hypertension may be possibly attributable to systemic low grade inflammation and

alterations in the blood coagulation, fibrinolysis and complement systems.

Are elevated CRP levels relevant for the management of CSU? sgAH are the first
line therapy in acute and chronic urticaria (1). CSU patients with lower CRP levels
showed better responses to treatment with sgAH than those with higher CRP levels
in this and other studies, but not in all (Suppl. Table 4.5). Non-response rates for
sgAH in other studies [46-60% (31, 32) for standard doses and up to 40% including
up-dosing (32)] are similar to our findings. Interestingly, CRP levels were reported to
be significantly decreased after treatment with antihistamines (33, 34) or steroids
(35).

CSU patients with elevated CRP levels were previously described to show high rates
of response to oral cyclosporine therapy (22). This may be explained, at least in part,
by the fact that 1) CRP is linked to ASST positivity and 2) ASST+ patients show
higher rates of response to cyclosporine as compared to ASST- CSU. Reportedly, 4

of 5 ASST+ CSU patients become ASST- in response to treatment with cyclosporine

(36, 37). Interestingly, CRP levels appear not to differ between responders and non
responders to omalizumab treatment (38).

In summary, we confirm that CRP levels are relevant for the management of CSU.
The fact that high CRP levels predict poor responses to treatment with sgAHs may
help physicians to identify patients who need a faster step up in their therapeutic

regime (1), rather than prolonged sgAH treatment with little or no benefit.

The limitations of this study include its retrospective design, that some, albeit very
few patients used corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants at the time of blood

sampling, and that CRP was measured only once in most patients.

It is easy and inexpensive to measure CRP in CSU patients, and the current
guideline for chronic urticaria management recommends to do so (1). Elevated levels
of CRP may help to exclude autoinflammatory conditions, urticarial vasculitis and
other differential diagnoses of CSU. Our findings show that they may also help to
better manage CSU patients, as they reflect disease activity, predict subgroup
allocation and indicate a risk of poor response to antihistamine treatment.
Prospective studies are needed to test CRP for its use as a biomarker in the

management of patients with CSU.
