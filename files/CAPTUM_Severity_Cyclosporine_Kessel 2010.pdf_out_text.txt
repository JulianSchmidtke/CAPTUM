Abstract

Background: The treatment of severe chronic urticaria (CU) remains a difficult goal
to achieve. Many patients do not respond to anti-histamine therapy, even when offlabel doses are given. Thus, cyclosporine-A (CsA) becomes a good therapeutic
option for severe patients and for some, long-term therapy is required. We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of low-dose CsA, when treatment cannot be discontinued and long-term CsA therapy is needed to maintain severe CU in remission.
Methods: Among 2000 patients with CU who were referred to our outpatient clinic,
120 patients who suffered from a very severe CU began treatment with CsA 3 mg/
kg. A clinical and laboratory followup was performed during this period of treatment.

Results: In 20 patients, CsA was discontinued within 2-15 days after initiation
because of side-effects. Among 62 of the remaining 100 patients (62%), CsA was
administered for a period of 3 months with a highly beneficial outcome. In another
20 patients (20%), CsA was considered beneficial; however, it was required for a
longer period of time, 5-10 years for some of the cases. In all cases, CsA was well
tolerated and most important, it was safe. For 18 patients (18%), CsA therapy was
reported as failed.

Conclusion: A low dose of CsA is a good option for patients who suffer from especially severe CU. In most cases, this therapy regimen is considered effective and
safe. For a small group of patients, long-term therapy is needed, and until now it is

considered safe.

The major concept of chronic urticaria (CU) is that it is of
an autoimmune origin and is based on the finding of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies that are directed against the antiIgE receptor on mast cells in 30-40% of patients suffering
from CU (1). However, subsequent research has characterized
CU in the broader context of an immune-mediated disorder
rather than a focused autoimmune event. In this respect, a
polyclonal activation of B cells and the presence of unrelated
autoantibodies such as anti-thyroid antibodies were reported
in patients with CU (2). Also, CD4+ T cells were found to
be in an ‘activated state’ as evidenced by the over-expression
of CD40L on their surface in association with disease severity
(3). In addition, we later reported on the elevation of MMP9 in the plasma of patients with severe CU (4).

In practice, however, most specialists who deal with this
disabling disorder are mainly concerned with the management of patients who suffer from severe form of CU. In a
study where 562 patients with CU were followed, mild to

1478

moderate CU responded well to H1 antihistamines. However,
46% (most of whom were defined as severe) were considered
nonresponders to H1 blockers (5). This impression was confirmed by others, where 40-50% of patients with a severe
form of CU did not respond sufficiently well to H1-blockers
and therefore needed more aggressive therapy (6). When
treatment is discussed, one should consider the issue of CU
duration. In this respect, the duration was assessed in a
follow-up study among 220 patients with CU. Whereas CU
was resolved within 1 year in only 35% of the patients, for
29%, the symptoms gradually decreased after 1 year, however, among 40-50% CU persisted for more than 1 year (7).
In this respect, we also reported continuing CU for 3 years in
50% of the patients who experienced a very severe onset of
urticaria (8). Thus, when CU is severe and long lasting,
defined as nonresponding to H1-blockers and short courses
of corticosteroids are repetitively required, low-dose cyclosporine-A (CsA) turns to be an optional therapeutic choice.

In 1991, Fradin et al. was the first to give CsA 6 mg/kg
for a period of 3-9 weeks to three patients suffering from
severe CU. Despite its beneficial effects, CsA was discontinued in all the three patients because of its undesirable sideeffects (9). Two years later, Barlow RJ etal. treated 12
patients who suffered from severe CU with low-dose CsA
(3 mg/ml) for 1 month, and reported on both its safety and
beneficial effect (10). In 1997, our group described a modified
protocol for CsA administration over a 3-month period, with
an initial dose of 3 mg/kg that was gradually reduced. Onethird of the patients with CU were cured and another third
experienced reduced symptom severity (11). Notably, in
one-third of the patients in full remission, urticaria relapsed
6-12 months after CsA was discontinued, and longer CsA
therapy was needed.

During the last decade, CsA was widely administered by
many centers mainly for patients with very severe CU.
Although there is agreement that it is a drug with evidencebased benefit and short-term safety, only a few studies posed
the question of how long CsA could be administered
to patients who need it for longer periods. In most of the
previously mentioned studies, CsA was administered for
1-3 months and in many of them, urticaria relapsed upon
CsA discontinuation and longer therapy was considered. In
this regard, we reported on a longer CsA therapy for a small
group of patients as being efficient and safe (12).

In this study, we summarize our long-term experience with
CsA therapy over more than a decade. We focus on the
issues of its beneficial effect, its safety and mainly on the
option of administering CsA for a long time period. We discuss the question of whether patients on long-term CsA
therapy should fear malignancy.

Methods

Between 1997 and 2009, 2000 patients suffering from CU
were followed in our outpatient clinic (a referral center for
CU). Among these patients, 120 patients who were considered to be especially severe and nonresponders to conventional therapy for at least 6 months were initiated on 3 mg/kg
CsA. Patients with pure physical urticaria, presumed chronic
infection, food or food additive intolerance were not included
in the study.

The decision of giving CsA was undertaken when these
patients were considered as nonresponders to high doses of
anti-histamines, or to the addition of H2 blockers, singular, or
when their quality of life was altered because of the sedative
side-effects of high (off-label) doses of anti-histamines. We preferred low-dose CsA therapy over the need of administering
recurrent short courses of corticosteroids. Low alternate day
doses of prednisone were sufficient to control severe urticaria
in only few number of patients. All patients in whom CsA
therapy was well tolerated and was continued for at least
3 months were closely evaluated every 4-6 weeks for their
urticaria status. Blood pressure and routine laboratory analysis
including: cell blood count (CBC), serum electrolytes, glucose,
cholesterol, uric acid and creatinine were closely observed
every 6-8 weeks. Because of the fact that serum creatinine does

not increase until glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is below
50% of normal, we calculated GFR according to the modified
Cockroft-Gault GFR formula (13). Later, whether still on CsA
for longer periods or discontinued, patients were evaluated
every 3 months for a period between 3 and 10 years.

Urticaria score

All patients were scored on a four-point scale as formerly
described by Breneman et al. Briefly, this scale takes into
consideration the number of lesions, number of separate episodes, average size of lesions, average duration of lesions and
pruritus as follows: 0 = no symptoms; 1 = mild urticaria
(1-4 points); 2 = moderate urticaria (5-9 points); 3 = severe
urticaria (10 points). The urticaria score was performed at
baseline before starting CsA and during follow up (14).

The mode of cyclosporine-A therapy

When patients responded and sufficiently tolerated the treatment, they continued with 3 mg/kg CsA for 2 months; then
their dosage was gradually decreased to 2 and the 1 mg/kg
during the following month. Patients were then followed to
assess whether remission was long lasting or if they needed
H1 blockers if urticaria was still persistent though in a milder
form. When urticaria was severe and CsA therapy could not
be discontinued, patients continued with a minimal CsA dose
(1-1.5 mg/kg) and were closely followed.

Long-term safety

All patients with severe CU who received CsA therapy for a
period of 3 months or longer were followed for a period of
3-10 years. During this period of time, we were able to monitor their general health status and looked for possible related
malignancies, especially among those who were treated for
5-10 years.

Results (See Fig. 1)

Of 120 patients in whom CsA was begun, treatment was
discontinued for 20 patients (16.5%) because of severe
side-effects. In nine patients, treatment was stopped after
2days of therapy because of severe gastrointestinal
side-effects (abdominal pains and/or diarrhea). In another 11
patients, CsA was discontinued after 10-15 days because of
the persistence of peripheral neuropathy or severe headaches.
Among 100 patients who tolerated CsA well (free of all sideeffects mentioned clinically), treatment was continued for at
least 3 months (for some much longer). This enabled us to
evaluate them during the course of therapy and then for a
variable period of time between 3 and 10 years.

Among these patients, 30 (30%) achieved full remission
(urticaria score 0) and CsA was discontinued after 3 months.
Those patients who remained in remission for at least 3 years
had their follow-up discontinued. In another 32 patients
(32%), CsA was considered moderately beneficial (urticaria
score 1-2), the severity of urticaria was declined to a degree

Long-term treatment

Figure 1 Among 120 patients with chronic urticaria who were treated with cyclosporine-A (CsA) (3 mg/kg/day), treatment for 20
patients was stopped because of side-effects. From the remaining
100 patients, after 3 months of treatment, the urticaria resolved in
30 patients and became milder in another 32 patients. In eighteen
patients, the treatment was failed. In 20 patients, severe urticaria

in which maintenance with anti-histamine therapy was sufficient, and the patients’ quality of life was satisfactory. Thus,
CsA was summarized as variably beneficial in 62 (62%)
patients, and they were able to discontinue therapy after
3 months. In 20 patients, CsA was highly beneficial and complete or almost complete remission was achieved; however,
when CsA was discontinued or the dosage was reduced below
1 mg/kg, severe urticaria and angioedema reappeared (urticaria score 3) and, therefore, 1-2 mg/kg CsA was continued.

In eight patients, CsA was continued for 8-14 months and
then discontinued, enabling patients to maintain a reasonable
quality of life with anti-histamine therapy only (urticaria
score 1-2). In another 12 patients, and because of the impossibility of discontinuing CsA, a very low dose of CsA
(1-1.5 mg/kg) was continued for variable periods between
5-10 years. These patients tolerated CsA well (there was no
blood pressure elevation or laboratory abnormalities).

In all 20 patients on long-term CsA therapy, GFR was
assessed: At baseline, a mean of 106 + 11 GFR ml/min was
measured. After | year in some, and 5-10 years in the others,
a mean of 99 + 14 GFR was measured. None of them had
GFR below the normal.

Careful evaluation (although in a small group of patients)
did not raise any clues for possible malignancy development.
Finally, in 18 patients where CsA was administered for at
least 1 month was considered as a total failure and therefore
discontinued.

The accepted nontoxic serum level of CsA is reported to
be in the range between 75-325 ng/ml. However, this range

reappeared after stopping treatment and, therefore, 1-2 mg/kg CsA
was continued. In eight of these 20 patients, CsA was continued
for 8-14 months and then discontinued. In another 12 patients,
owing to the impossibility of discontinuing CsA, a very low dose
of CsA (1-1.5 mg/kg) was continued for longer periods between
5-10 years.

was adjusted for transplanted patients; however, it was never
evaluated for other diseases. It is important to note, in all of
our treated patients’ sera, measured levels of CsA did not
exceed 100 ng/ml, although most patients where CsA was
maintained between 1-1.5 mg/ml, serum levels were approximately 50 ng/ml.

Discussion

When severe CU continues and conventional doses of both
first generation and nonsedative antihistamines are not
effective, patients become disabled and their quality of life
turns to be unbearable. At this stage, higher doses of antihistamines such as Fexofenadine and Desloratadine are considered and there are many reported on their additive value
in improving urticaria (15). However, 40-50% of patients
with extremely severe CU who could tolerate high doses of
sedative antihistamines or off-label doses of nonsedative
antihistamines remained unresponsive and complained of
a lower quality of life, thus requiring a more aggressive
therapy (6).

During the last decade, many studies pointed to the importance of assessing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in
patients with severe CU. In these studies, health status scores
in patients with CU were comparable to those of patients
with ischemic heart disease. Others, being aware of assessing
HRQoL, described a higher incidence of sleep disorders,
work disability and psychiatric morbidity among patients
with CU. The quality of life decreases among those patients

where higher and continuous doses of H1-blockers may cause
tiredness or lowered concentration during work time (16, 17).

When patients did not respond to anti-histamine therapy,
even when off-label doses were administered, short courses of
corticosteroids for a period of 2-3 weeks were administered,
sometimes in addition to leukotrein antagonists. In many of
these cases, the attenuation of CU severity allowed a reasonable quality of life. However, when urticaria was extremely
severe and longer corticosteroid therapy was the only option,
we then considered low-dose CsA to be a better option for a
long-lasting and severe CU (18).

During the last decade, CsA was reported to be beneficial
in 27 original studies, some of which were double-blind controlled studies (19, 20). In six of them, the dose of CsA was
between 4-5 mg/kg, whereas a low dose (2-3 mg/kg) was
given in the other studies including our study. When higher
doses were administered, side-effects, such as hypertension,
peripheral neuropathy and increased serum creatinine, were
reported in 20-30% of the patients. In most patients, they
were transient or improved following dose decrease, and therapy discontinuation of therapy was rare. However, when a
low dose of CsA was administered (2-3 mg/kg), most studies
reported on a very low incidence of side-effects (mostly gastrointestinal or peripheral neuropathy) (11, 20, 21).

In this prospective cohort, 20 patients (16.5%) developed
rapid onset severe side-effects, and CsA therapy had to be
discontinued. However, when CsA doses were below the
range of 3 mg/kg, mild side-effects such as peripheral neuropathy or abdominal discomfort were transient, and treatment
was always tolerated. We also recommend that patients on
long-term low-dose CsA should undergo periodically GFR
examination, to prevent even mild CsA nephrotoxicity.

The main issue of this study is to discuss the need for
long-term therapy (5-10 years) with low-dose CsA that was
administered to 12 of our patients, who insisted on continuing this highly beneficial therapy regimen. The major concern in this report is the fear of malignancy that may
possibly appear in patients who are maintained on long-term
CsA therapy. The safety of giving low-dose CsA in severe
CU over a long time period should be further evaluated in a
larger group of patients. Moreover, the effectiveness of lowdose CsA in some patients with extremely severe CU and for
those who must take this therapy regimen as their only
option for maintaining a good quality of life must be continued until additional safety data are available. The incidence
and risk of malignancy is reported to be elevated in solid
organ transplant recipients (mainly those on immunosuppressive therapy) compared with the general population (22). As
proof of the relationship between immunosuppressive therapy
and posttransplant malignancy, epidemiological data reveal

that the length of exposure to immunosuppressive therapy
and the intensity of therapy are clearly related to the development of malignancy. The incidence of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder was reported to be 1.6% with onset
occurring more than 5 years after transplantation especially
when CsA was administered at doses of more than 5 mg/ml.
Indirectly, immunosuppressive drugs greatly increase the
posttransplant risk of malignancy by impairing cancer surveillance and facilitating the action of oncogenic viruses.
Thus, both the higher dose of CsA therapy and the higher
incidence of oncogenic viral infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in these patients
are the main risk factors that contribute to the development
of posttransplant malignancies (23).

The issue of the autonomous cellular mechanism for CsA
and tacrolimus in promoting malignancy was proposed in
animal models only. In this respect, tumor progression developed in T-, B-, and NK cell-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-beige mice but not in normal mice. It is
also believed (as reported previously) that malignancy is
probably related to CsA dosage, suggesting that low doses
are safe (24).

Nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) that were reported
to be associated with immunosuppression have been mostly
reported in solid organ transplant patients, particularly in
renal transplant patients (25, 26). Although the two most
important risk factors for NMSCs in the transplant population are the amount of sun exposure and age at transplantation, the duration of immunosuppressive drug therapy has
been considered to be a risk factor predisposing to NMSCs
(27). Therefore, one should consider the recommendation to
avoid sun exposure in patients with CU who are on longterm CsA therapy.

In our case, a follow-up study that was conducted 8—
10 years after patients who were administered CsA for only
3 months and then discontinued, or in patients where longterm therapy was administered (although to a small cohort of
patients) does not show any cases of malignancy or any
increase in the incidence of infections. Thus, our data suggest
that when low-dose CsA is used in patients with CU (who
are otherwise normal) and where the rate of CMV or EBV
infections is definitely no higher than that of normal, individuals are probably safe.

Finally, we believe that the chance of malignancy is much
lower when serum CsA levels do not exceed 50 ng/ml (a very
low serum level). In conclusion, when CsA is required for
longer periods, the goal should be to keep the dosage
between 1-1.5 mg/ml. However, further studies with a larger
number of patients with CU are required to establish this
concept.
