ABSTRACT:

Background: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is acommon,
debilitating disease that is frequently resistant to standard
therapy. Omalizumab, anti-immunoglobulin-E humanized
monclonal antibody, was recently shown to be effective in
treating resistant CSU.
Objectives: To investigated the treatment of CSU with omalizumab in Israel.
Methods: We conducted a multicenter retrospective analysis
of patients with refractory CSU treated with omalizuamb in
Israel during 2012-2013. Complete improvement was defined
as resolution of symptoms with no need for other medications,
or satisfactory when patients’ condition improved but required
regular or intermittent doses of antihistamines.
Results: Forty-three patients received omalizumab off-label
for refractory CSU. Their mean age was 45 + 12 years and
CSU duration was 4.3 + 4 years. In this cohort, 98% were unsuccessfully treated with high dose H(1)-antihistamines, 88%
with systemic glucocorticoids and 30% with cyclosporine and/
or other immune-modulators. Fourteen patients received only
one injection of omalizumab, while the other 29 received on
average of 4.3 + 3.2 injections; 30 patients received 150 mg/
month and 13 received 300 mg/month. Following omalizumab
therapy, disease remitted within weeks in 86% of patients,
of whom half achieved complete remission. The latter was
associated with usage of high dose omalizumab, 300 mg/
month vs. 150 mg/month (P= 0.02) and repeated therapy (i.e.,
multiple injections vs. a single injection) (P= 0.0005).
Conclusions: Omalizumab is an effective and safe treatment
for refractory CSU with rapid onset of action for inducing and
maintaining remission. Treating CSU patients mandates an
individual approach, because while low dose omalizumab will
suffice for some patients others might need higher doses and
prolonged therapy.

hronic spontaneous urticaria is a common disease, affectC ing 1%-1.3% of the population, and is characterized by a
typical and severe itching rash lasting for more than 6 weeks
[1,2]. This disease may be associated with comorbidities. It may
persist for years and adversely affects quality of life, sleep, daily
activities, school and work life, as well as social interactions.
The current revised and unified guidelines of the European
Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and Global
Allergy and Asthma European Network, as well as the World
Allergy Association committees (EAACI/GALEN/EDF/WAO)
suggest a step-wise approach to the management of CSU [3,4].
This approach aims to achieve complete symptom control, using
a three-step process. The first step is the use of a standard-dose
non-sedating H1 antihistamine [4]. These drugs are efficacious
but increasing the dose fourfold (step 2), above the licensed
doses, is frequently required and still leaves a substantial proportion of patients symptomatic. Hence, short-term corticosteroid
therapy (3-7 days) may be required. Unfortunately, for most
unresponsive CSU patients longer periods of corticosteroid therapy are needed and are associated with numerous undesired side
effects [1-4]. Refractory disease requires further interventions
(step 3), using cyclosporine A, omalizumab, or montelukast.
Low dose cyclosporine A is efficacious in 70% of patients with
glucocorticoid-dependent CSU; however, this response generally
lasts in only 50% of responders [5]. Furthermore, toxicity associated with cyclosporine A therapy, although less common following the use of low doses as required for CSU, still raises concern.
Hence this therapy may not be suitable for all CSU patients.
Omalizumab, an anti-immunoglobulin E humanized monoclonal antibody, is becoming increasingly recognized as an effective therapy for difficult-to-treat CSU. Before 2013 its use was
off-label for this condition. Omalizumab is an anti-IgE antibody
that binds only circulating free IgE and not cell-bound IgE. It

was originally designed to treat allergic asthma and rhinitis
[6]. In these conditions the postulated mechanisms by which
omalizumab exerts its effects are decreased free IgE and downregulation of IgE receptors (FceRI) on mast and other cells,
occurring within 12-16 weeks [6-9]. In the last few years, several
clinical studies reported that omalizumab therapy was highly
effective for resistant CSU as well. Notably, in some studies even
a single injection of omalizumab was beneficial, while in others
the response was dose-dependent [7-11]. Since omalizumab was
used worldwide as off-label therapy for refractory CSU, there is
currently a lack of data regarding the length of therapy required,
tapering-down protocols, as well as concomitant therapy use.
The present study investigated the efficacy and tolerability of
omalizumab for CSU in a ‘real-life’ scenario in Israel.

 

 

PATIENTS AND METHODS

We conducted a multicenter retrospective review of all patients
with CSU who were treated with omalizuamb from January
2012 to December 2013. CSU was defined as episodes of hives
with or without angioedema and occurring either intermittently or continuously for 6 weeks or longer. Patients were
excluded if they had drug-related urticaria or angioedema
exclusively. Demographic data were recorded, including age,
gender, and prior and concurrent therapy. Omalizumab was
administered off-label, when available, and in the amount
available (i.e., once or more in doses of either 150 mg or 300
mg monthly). Due to the retrospective nature of this study,
response was recorded as a categorical result (complete, partial, none) based on the patients’ subjective evaluation and on
their need for additional treatment with H1-antihistamines.
Complete response was defined as complete resolution of
symptoms and no need for further medications (other than
omalizumab). A satisfactory (partial) response was defined as
an improvement in the patient’s condition, with the patient
still requiring regular or intermittent doses of antihistamines.

 

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Microsoft Excel version 2003 (Microsoft Corp., Seattle, WA)
and the statistical program SPSS 13.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA)
were used for statistical analysis. Results are presented as means
and standard deviations. Findings were compared between the
groups using the Student t-test or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant

 

RESULTS

The study group consisted of 43 CSU patients treated with
omalizumab [Figure 1]. In this cohort 30 (70%) were females,
their mean age was 45 + 12 years (range 20-64), and the duration of CSU prior to omalizumab therapy was 4.3 + 4 years
[Table 1]. While all patients were treated with antihistamines,

study omlizumab was prescribed off-label for the indication of
CSU, 14 patients received only one injection while the other
29 received an average of 4.3 + 3.2 injections (range 2-12). Of
those receiving multiple injections, 7 were given more than one

patients were treated regularly each month. In this cohort 13
patients received 300 mg omalizumab/month while 30 patients
received 150 mg once or more.

Following treatment with omalizumab CSU subsided in 37
patients (86%) of whom 21 (57%) showed complete response
and 16 (43%) a satisfactory improvement. In 35 of the 37
responders to omalizumab, the effect was documented within
the first few weeks after the first injection, while in the other 2
patients a dose increment to 300 mg was required to achieve
response. It is noteworthy that complete recovery occurred in
11 of 30 patients (36%) treated with 150 mg omalizumab as
compared to 10 of 13 (77%) who were finally treated with 300
mg (P = 0.02).

Treatment failure was observed in six patients, all of whom
received only one dose of 150 mg. In other words, treatment
failure was diagnosed in 6 of 14 patients (43%) who received
one dose vs. none of 29 who received multiple doses (P =
0.0005). One patient experienced palpitations and weakness
during the first 2 hours of the first course of omalizumab
therapy; further courses were uneventful.

 

DISCUSSION

We found omalizumab to be efficacious in the vast majority
of patients with severe and resistant CSU, following failure of
high dose H1-antihistamines and other immune modulating agents. The overall response rate to omalizumab in our
cohort was impressively high: 86%, with 57% of responders
showing complete response and 43% a partial remission.
Only 14% of patients showed no response, most of whom
received low dose and/or a single injection of omalizumab,
mainly due to the low availability of the drug.

This biologic drug recently emerged as an effective and
safe alternative for treating CSU patients [7,13-16]. However,
unlike omalizumab dosing for moderate-severe asthma,
which is based on IgE levels and body weight, the effect of
omalizumab on CSU seems to be unrelated to these parameters [7-12]. Moreover, even a single injection was found to be
beneficial in some of our patients, as noted also in other observational and small clinical studies [8,12]. In contrast, in phase
III studies of omalizumab for CSU a fixed dose of 300 mg/
month was the most efficacious [7,10]. In the study by Maurer
et al. [7], the proportion of patients completely free of hives
was 10%, 23% and 53%, in those receiving placebo, 150 mg
omalizumab, and 300 mg omalizumab, respectively. In another
study, even higher doses of 450 mg/month were needed for
some patients [8]. In our cohort the doses were limited by the
availability of omalizumab, thus the initial dose was either 150
or 300 mg thereafter if plausible therapy was continued. For
non-responders who received the 150 mg dose, a higher dose
of 300 mg/month was used. We observed that omalizumab
was most effective for CSU when higher doses were used and

for a prolonged period. Therefore, it seems that a higher dose
of omalizumab is more efficacious, although lower doses may
suffice for some patients. These findings support the need for
tailored use of omalizumab for CSU.

Our cohort of CSU patients included patients diagnosed
with autoimmune chronic urticaria as well as patients with
no autoimmune features. Few studies have investigated the
response of various CSU phenotypes to the available medications, especially omalizumab. In a selective cohort of 12
patients who were designated as having an autoimmune basis
for their urticaria, improvement was noted in 11 of 12 patients
[14]. Similarly, efficacy was shown in a cohort of patients with
IgE autoantibodies to thyroperoxidase [2]. On the other hand,
a case series of eight CSU patients with no autoimmune features also showed improvement following omalizumab therapy
[17]. A more recent study of a mixed cohort of CSU patients
examined whether any specific autoimmune marker or clinical
characteristics would serve as predictor(s) of responsiveness to
omalizumab. The results showed that indeed all phenotypes
of CSU are responsive to omalizumab therapy [18]. Finally,
a retrospective study of patients with both spontaneous and
inducible urticaria documented a high rate of response in both
groups [8]. Therefore, it appears that omalizumab may benefit
patients with chronic urticaria, regardless of the immune process underlying this condition.

CSU is a disease of spontaneous remission and exacerbation; thus, the length of therapy with omablizumab or other
immune modulators is yet to be determined. In the randomized clinical studies published so far, recurrence of symptoms
following termination of 3-6 months therapy was common
[7,11]. However, in the current study some patients achieved
a long-standing remission (months or a year) after treatment
with omalizumab, with no need for further medication. On
the other hand, prolonged therapy of up to 12 months in our
study and 37 months in other studies was both beneficial and
safe [8,19,20].

Consequently, although omalizumab is remarkably effective for patients with different CSU phenotypes (and probably for other types of chronic urticaria), the dose and length
of therapy with this drug has yet to be determined and will
probably be individually based. Omalizumab is an expensive
drug that may have adverse events (e.g., anaphylaxis). Thus,
it remains prudent to consider this therapy only after a full
assessment by a specialist who is experienced both in treating
moderate-severe CSU and in using omalizumab.

The mechanisms whereby omalizumab ameliorates CSU
symptoms are currently uncertain and are under investigation. Previous studies have shown that omalizumab decreases
free IgE levels and down-regulates receptor (FceR1) expression on mast cells and basophils within 12-16 weeks after
initiation of therapy [21,22]. These mechanisms of action,
while also playing a role in CSU, cannot be the sole explana

tion for the effect of omalizumab in this condition since most
patients, in this study and others, experienced rapid improvement (within 1-3 weeks) [12,14]. Recent studies showed that
omalizumab may intervene in immune mediated processes
through direct basophil stabilization [12], effects on pathogenic IgE antibodies [23], or a decrease in IgE synthesis by
targeting membrane IgE-positive B cells [24].

There are some limitations to our study, such as its retrospective design, small study population, and the lack of a
standard protocol for the assessment and management of CSU.

 

CONCLUSIONS

We found omalizumab to be an effective and safe treatment for
moderate to severe CSU, with a rapid onset of action for inducing and maintaining remission. A tailored regimen of omalizumab, considering dose and length of therapy, is required, as
are step-down protocols regarding concomitant medications.

Ex vivo culture of circulating breast tumor cells for individualized testing of drug susceptibility

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are present at low concentrations in the peripheral blood of patients with solid tumors.
It has been proposed that the isolation, ex vivo culture, and
characterization of CTCs may provide an opportunity to noninvasively monitor the changing patterns of drug susceptibility
in individual patients as their tumors acquire new mutations.
In a proof-of-concept study, Yu et al. established CTC cultures
from six patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast
cancer. Three of five CTC lines tested were tumorigenic in
mice. Genome sequencing of the CTC lines revealed preex
isting mutations in the P/K3CAgene and newly acquired
mutations in the estrogen receptor gene (ESR1), PIK3CA gene,
and fibroblast growth factor receptor gene (FGFR2), among
others. Drug sensitivity testing of CTC lines with multiple
mutations revealed potential new therapeutic targets. With
optimization of CTC culture conditions, this strategy may help
identify the best therapies for individual cancer patients over
the course of their disease.
