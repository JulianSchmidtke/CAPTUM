Abstract

Background: Although the diagnosis and management of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is well documented
in the literature, some aspects of the disease remain unclear. We aimed to further describe the natural history,
prognostic factors, humanistic burden and uptake of traditional and alternative therapies in patients with CSU.

Methods: This was a prospective, cross-sectional analysis at a single centre. We reviewed patient medical records and
conducted a survey in patients with CSU.

Results: 72 patients participated in the study with a median duration of CSU of 48 months. 30% of patients

had symptoms that resolved in under 2 years with these patients trending towards an older age of onset of CSU
(48+ 17 years). 16% of patients had symptoms lasting 10 years or longer with these patients trending towards

a younger age of onset (22+ 16 years). Patients with a relapsing/remitting disease course (31%) and those with
co-existing angioedema (57%) trended towards a longer median duration of CSU (96 and 50 months respectively)
and were observed to have a higher proportion of patients reporting CSU duration of 10 years or longer (33% and
25%, p= 0.033 and p=0.036 respectively). Patients with co-existing autoimmune/thyroid disease (19%) trended
towards a shorter median duration of CSU (37 months). 54 patients (75%) reported sleep disturbance and 29 patients
(43%) required emergency room visit(s) for symptomatic control. 84% of patients who trialed second generation
antihistamines reported a response to treatment, while 73% of patients who trialed omalizumab reported a response
to treatment. Patients using alternative medicine such as acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine and naturopathic
medicine had lower reported response rates (20-29%) to treatment.

 

 

 

Conclusions: The natural history of CSU may be longer than previously reported with our study finding a median
duration of symptoms of nearly 4 years with one-third of patients reporting a relapsing/remitting disease course.
Younger age of onset, a relapsing/remitting disease course and angioedema may predict a longer duration of CSU,
whereas older age of onset and co-existing autoimmune/thyroid disease may predict a shorter duration of CSU.
Reported symptomatic benefit was higher from guidelines based pharmacologic therapy versus various alternative
medicines.

quality of life for those affected. While the diagnosis
and treatment of CSU has been well documented in
the literature, the natural history, long term outcomes
and prognostic factors are poorly understood for this
condition. There is also limited information on the use of
complementary and alternative medicine in patients with
CSU as well as the perceived benefit when compared
with standard pharmacologic therapy. The goal of this
study was to answer these questions and further report
on the burden of disease for both the individual and the
health care system, particularly in Canada.

A recent cross sectional analysis has estimated that
CSU affects about 0.23% of the population in the United
States, with women more than twice as likely to have the
condition relative to men [2]. CSU affects individuals
across their entire adult lifespan, with a slightly higher
prevalence in patients in their fifth and sixth decades
of life [2]. The prevalence of disease among various
ethnicities is also felt to be fairly comparable [2]. Few
studies have evaluated the natural history of CSU with
conflicting results about long term remission rates [35] Most of these studies that have analyzed the natural
history have been designed as single centered studies
with limited long term follow up of patients. The general
consensus is that about one-third to one-half of patients
with CSU will have remission of their disease within
1 year [3, 6, 7). However, longer term remission rates
are less consistent with estimations of ongoing disease
at 5 years ranging from 15 to 70% [3, 8]. More recent
studies that have looked at remission rates in children,
estimate that remission rates are low and are only about
10.3% per year [9]. The presence of angioedema is
believed to predict CSU disease duration and severity
[3]. There has also been some evidence that patients with
autoimmune urticaria (based on positive autologous skin
serum testing), have a shorter duration of disease and a
higher rate of remission [7, 10]. However, other studies
have disagreed with this finding, showing no relationship
to positive autologous skin serum testing and disease
duration/severity [3]. More information is required to
better define the long-term prognosis and predictors of
severity and duration for patients with CSU.

Several studies have shown that the symptoms of
CSU can often have a significant effect on patient wellbeing, utilization of health care resources and quality
of life, particularly sleep and work impairment [11-13].
There are various scoring systems available to assess the
burden of disease for patients with CSU. One of the most
commonly used is the Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7)
which assigns points based on the number of wheals
present as well as severity of pruritus, including impact
on daily activities and sleep, for seven consecutive days
[14]. A recent study that collected patient reported data

Page 2 of 11

in the Adelphi Real World 2015 Urticaria Disease Specific
Programme reported that the most common symptoms
reported by patients with CSU included itch, sleep
problems and anxiety/distress which affected 75%, 23%
and 18% of patients respectively [15]. Overall however,
few studies have evaluated the burden on health care
resources. One study from Brazil estimates that patients
with CSU have twice the number of physician visits
and twice the number of emergency room visits when
compared to controls [12]. Similarly, an Argentinian
study showed that 7.8% of patients with CSU required
emergency room visits to control their symptoms with
an average yearly direct cost per patient estimated to be
USD $1015 + $752 [16].

Management guidelines for CSU have recently been
developed and accepted by most jurisdictions. These
guidelines recommend initial treatment with second
generation antihistamines, which can be used up to
four times the recommended dose if there is inadequate
response to standard dosing [17]. Omalizumab and
cyclosporine, added on to treatment with antihistamines,
are recommended as second- and third-line treatments
respectively. Short courses of steroids may be
required for acute exacerbations [1]. First generation
antihistamines, H2-receptor antagonists, leukotriene
receptor antagonists, and other immunosuppressive
drugs including sulfasalazine, dapsone, and intravenous
immunoglobulin (IVIG) were previously recommended
as add on therapy to those not responding to
antihistamines [18]. However, the use of these drugs have
recently fallen out of favour due to the more effective and
better tolerated medications that are currently available.

Although there are many different forms of
complementary and alternative medicine available, their
effectiveness in treating CSU is questionable. There
has been some studies that looked at acupuncture for
global symptom improvement when used in conjunction
with pharmacologic therapy however a_ recently
published meta-analysis showed there is overall a low
level of evidence for its use [19]. There has also been a
few randomized trials that have looked at the use of
traditional Chinese medicine as an adjunct to traditional
pharmacologic therapy in CSU with varying results
[20-23]. However, to our knowledge, there has not
been any studies that have evaluated patient uptake of
these alternative medicine practices and their perceived
benefit.

 

Methods

Study design

This was a prospective cross-sectional, single centre
study that took place at a private allergy/immunology
clinic in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
Stepaniuk et al. Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol (2020) 16:63

Potential participants were identified by diagnostic
code (CSU) in the clinic’s electronic medical record
from 2013 to 2015. Each file was manually reviewed
by the investigators for inclusion in the study (see
criteria below). Relevant medical data obtained from
the medical chart included patient age, gender, baseline
medical history including medical comorbidities,
duration and severity of CSU, prior treatments, relevant
co-morbid inducible urticarias, prescribed treatments,
and laboratory results (if applicable). Data was collated
in an electronic spreadsheet with patients identified by
a unique participant identification number.

Eligible participants who met the inclusion criteria
for the study (see below) were sent a package in the
mail which included a letter of initial contact outlining
the purpose of the study and an informed consent
document. The letter of initial contact stated that
eligible participants would be contacted in 4—6 weeks
for a follow-up telephone survey if they had signed and
returned the consent form to the investigator’s clinic
and agreed participate in the study. If patients declined
participation, no further contact was made. If patients
did not respond to the initial package, a follow-up
phone call was made to further describe the study
and answer any questions. Some eligible participants
were also approached at follow-up visits, as opposed
to communication through letter mail, if they had
a follow-up visit in the clinic within 4-6 weeks. A
telephone survey with a prepared oral script took place
4—6 weeks after initial contact to gather participantreported data (Additional file 1: Figure $1). Patients
that had a follow-up clinic visit scheduled within
4-6 weeks from initial contact had the option to
complete the survey in clinic as opposed to over the
telephone if they preferred. The survey asked questions
regarding ethnicity, onset of symptoms, number of
days per month with urticarial lesions present (either
continuous or intermittent), length of total disease
course (including remission if applicable), relapse rates
and duration, associated angioedema, identification
of specific triggers (not confirmed on provocation
testing), self-reported severity of disease (including
sleep disturbance), treatment(s) received with response
rates and alternative treatments sought with their
perceived response. Although not standardized, we
did record relevant laboratory findings in our patients
with CSU. The ordering of these blood tests was at
the discretion of the ordering attending physician and
based on the patient’s clinical history and physical
exam findings. Not all patients had laboratory results to
review and additionally, not all patients with laboratory
results had the same tests ordered.

Study population and data analysis

To be included in the study, patients must have met the
clinical diagnostic criteria for CSU, defined as recurrent
pruritic urticarial erythematous wheals, with each lesion
lasting less than 24 h, with continuous or intermittent
symptoms persisting for 6 weeks or longer with no
external trigger identified. This included patients with
co-existing inducible urticarias. Patients with CSU
presenting solely with angioedema in the absence of
urticaria were excluded from the study. Patients with
both active and resolved disease were included in the
analysis, and only patients with resolved disease were
used when analyzing the duration of disease. Patients
also must have been aged 19 or older, able to provide
consent to participate in the study and have been willing
to participate and complete the patient surveys. Patients
were excluded from the study if they were unable to
provide informed consent or if they were unwilling to
complete the patient questionnaire. Data obtained from
the medical chart and patient survey was entered, stored
and analyzed in an electronic spreadsheet by unique
patient identifier. Analysis of data was performed by the
authors using the electronic spreadsheet functions. Twotailed statistical analysis were performed to evaluate for
differences of study subgroups to determine significance
using electronic software.

Results

Patient demographics and duration of disease

A total of 72 patients who were eligible for the study
agreed to participate and completed the patient survey.
59 (82%) of the patients were female (Table 1). Slightly
more than half of the patients were Caucasian (54%),
with the reminder identifying as Asian (35%), Middle
Eastern (7%) First Nations (3%) and Hispanic (1%).
(Figure 1). For comparison, the demographics of the city
of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (location of
study) is also shown [24]. The median age of onset was
43-417 years old. 16 patients (22%) had active disease
at the time of data collection and 56 patients (78%)
indicated that their CSU had resolved. The median
duration of urticaria in patients with resolved CSU was
48 months with a range of 2 to 204 months. Of those
with resolved disease, 17 patients (30%) had urticaria
that resolved within 2 years, while 9 patients (16%) had
CSU that lasted 10 years or longer (Table 2 and Fig. 2).
Males with resolved CSU reported a median duration
of disease of 33 months whereas females reported a
median duration of 48 months. 5 males (45%) and 12
females (27%) had resolution of their CSU within 2 years
(p=0.226). The duration of disease was otherwise similar
for males and females (Table 2). Patients with resolved

CSU and disease resolution within 2 years had a median
age of CSU onset of 48 +17 years, and those with disease
that lasted 10 years or longer had a median age of CSU
onset of 22+16 years. Patients also reported urticarial
lesions present for a mean of 21+9 days per month. One
patient could not specify on their duration of symptoms,
and were excluded from this value.

 

 

 

Patients with relapsing/remitting course

22 patients (31%) reported a recurrence of their disease
after initial remission with a mean length of remission
of 21410 months. Those with disease recurrence
had a similar median age of onset of CSU of 42.5 years

 

Page 4 of 11

compared to 44.5 years in those patients denying CSU
recurrence. 3 males (23%) and 19 females (32%) reported
CSU recurrence, with no statistical difference (p= 0.516).
Of those with resolved CSU, 15 patients (27%) reported
a disease recurrence, with a total median duration of
disease of 96 months (including disease remission time).
5 of these patients (33%) reported a disease duration of
10 years or longer, compared to 4 patients (10%) who
had resolution of their CSU and denied a recurrence of
disease (p=0.033) (Table 2 and Fig. 2).

Angioedema

41 patients (57%) had associated angioedema and of
those patients with resolved CSU, 32 patients (57%) had
associated angioedema with their median duration of
CSU lasting 50 months. 8 patients (25%) had symptoms
lasting 10 years or longer compared to only 1 patient (4%)
who did not have angioedema (p=0.036) (Table 2 and
Fig. 2). 36 of the 41 patients who experienced angioedema
reported that they had an average of 5+7 episodes per
month. Five patients who experienced angioedema,
were unable to clearly quantify the frequency of their
episodes. Of the 22 patients that reported a recurrence
of their CSU, 14 patients had associated angioedema
(64%), whereas of the 50 patients that did not report
disease recurrence, 27 patients (54%) had angioedema
(p=0.447).

Provoking factors

A significant number of patients reported provoking
factors for their urticaria, including dermatographia
(47%), stress (38%), heat (35%), and cold (14%). Other
triggers reported by patients included foods (11%),
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (11%),
exercise (10%), alcohol (7%) and sunlight (3%) (Fig. 3).
Physical triggers were considered to be present based on
patient perception as indicated in their survey and were
not verified on provocation testing.

Co-morbid autoimmune and allergic diseases

A total of 14 patients (19%) reported co-existing thyroid
and/or autoimmune disease, with hypothyroidism (8%)
being most common. Other reported autoimmune
diseases included rheumatoid arthritis (7%), Crohn's
disease (1%), vitiligo (1%), celiac disease (1%) and HLAB27 spondyloarthopathy (1%) (Table 1). A few patients
had multiple co-existing autoimmune diseases. Of those
with resolved CSU, 10 patients (18%) reported a history
of autoimmune disease and had a median duration of
symptoms lasting 37 months. Three patients (30%) had
CSU that resolved within 2 years and one patient (10%)
had CSU that lasted 10 years or longer. These findings
were not statistically significant (Table 2 and Fig. 2). Of

the 22 patients that reported a recurrence of their CSU,
3 patients (14%) had associated autoimmune and/or
thyroid disease, whereas 11 patients (22%) without CSU
recurrence had autoimmune and/or thyroid disease
(p=0.407). 22 patients (31%) reported co-existing drug
allergies and 10 patients (14%) reported a family history
of CSU. (Table 1).

Quality of life indicators

54 patients (75%) reported that they had disrupted sleep
due to their urticaria and 29 patients (43%) presented
to the emergency room for uncontrollable symptoms
of their urticaria. Of note, five patients did not identify
if they visited an emergency room for their urticaria
(Table 1). 47 females (80%) reported sleep disturbance
from their CSU, comparted to only 7 males (54%)
(p=0.512). Duration of disease in those with resolved
CSU did not appear to influence either sleep disturbance
or emergency room visits. 20 patients (91%) with CSU
recurrence reported sleep disturbance, compared to only
34 patients (68%) without CSU recurrence (p=0.038).
There was no statistically significant difference in rates
of sleep disturbance or emergency room visits in patients
with angioedema or autoimmune/thyroid disease
(Table 3).

Pharmacologic treatments, alternative treatments

and self-reported response

The most trialed treatment for CSU were second
generation antihistamines with 68 patients (94%)
reporting their use. Other pharmacologic treatments
employed included first generation antihistamines in
51 patients (71%), prednisone in 28 patients (39%),

omalizumab in 15 patients (21%), cyclosporine in
three patients (4%), montelukast in two patients (3%),
intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in one patient
(1%) and methotrexate in one patient (1%) (Table 4).
Other therapies that were inquired about and were
not used included dapsone, hydroxychloroquine and
sulfasalazine. Self-reported response to pharmacologic
treatment varied, and was 84% for second generation
antihistamines, 84% for first generation antihistamines,
75% for prednisone and 73% for omalizumab. Although
few patients trialed therapy with cyclosporine
and methotrexate, all the patients who used these
medications reported a response to therapy. None of
the patients that trialed montelukast or IVIG reported
response to treatment (Table 4). Some patients reported
seeking alternative medicine practitioners to help with
management of their CSU. 15 patients sought advice
from a naturopath (21%), while five patients visited an
acupuncturist (7%) and seven patients sought advice
from a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner (10%)
(Table 5). Although inquired about, no patients saw a
chiropractor, herbalist or massage therapist for their
urticaria. Self-reported response to these alternative
practices were relatively low with 29% reporting benefit
from traditional Chinese medicine, 27% reporting benefit
from treatments provided by their naturopath and 20%
reporting benefit from acupuncture (Table 5).

We stratified our patient population by response
to treatment with second generation antihistamines
to see if we could observe any differences in patient
characteristics in these two groups (Table 6). Of
those that received treatment with second generation
antihistamines, 48 females (87%) and 9 males (69%)

reported treatment response to antihistamines while
4 males (31%) and 7 females (13%) did not (p=0.112).
Median age of CSU onset was similar between the two
groups. There was no association between treatment
response with second generation antihistamines and
CSU recurrence, angioedema or autoimmune/thyroid
disease (p = 0.418, p = 0.834 and p =0.159 respectively).
Patients that did not report response to treatment with
second generation antihistamines trended towards
reporting higher rates of sleep disturbance (91%)
and emergency room visits (64%) than those that did
respond to treatment with antihistamines (74% and 37%
respectively), but this was not statistically significant
(p=0.219 and p=0.099 respectively). There was no
difference observed in uptake of alternative therapies in
the two groups.

Laboratory findings

Standardized laboratory investigations were not part
of this protocol. However, we did observe that of 42
patients that had blood work including complete blood
counts, 2 of them had eosinophilia (>0.5 x 10° /L). 27
patients had evaluation for C-reactive protein (CRP) and
it was elevated in 8 patients (>4.8 mg/L). 38 patients had
testing for thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO) and
it was positive in 4 patients (>35 IU/ml). 23 patients had
laboratory testing for immunoglobulin E (IgE), and it was
elevated in 11 patients (> 430 ug/ml).

Discussion

Similar to previous studies, we found that CSU is a
disease that disproportionately affects women and
has a median age of onset in the fifth decade of life.
Previous studies have suggested that the prevalence

of CSU is similar among different ethnicities [2]. We
‘ound approximately half of our study population was
Caucasian and about one-third were of Asian descent.
This is fairly close to the overall demographics the
total population (city of Vancouver) and supports the
idea that prevalence rates are similar among different
ethnicities [24]. There was a slightly higher proportion of
Caucasians and those of Middle Eastern ethnicity noted
(relative to our city’s demographics) however, due to the
study size, it is difficult to make conclusive statements.
In patients with resolved disease, 30% of patients had
urticaria that resolved within 2 years and 16% of patients
had their urticaria last 10 years or longer with a median
duration of 48 months (4 years). It should be noted that
our study population is likely biased to patients with
a more severe/refractory course due to the referral
process, and the fact that we are a specialist clinic. We
noticed a large variability in the reported duration of
disease, which ranged from 2 to 204 months. A handful
of patients with a very long disease course affected
our statistical analysis as evidenced by the significant
difference between our calculated median and mean
duration of disease as well as our large standard deviation
(Table 2). We observed that males trended to have more
rapid CSU resolution (within 2 years), but this was not
statistically significant. The median age of onset of CSU
was also older (48 + 17 years) in patients who had disease
resolution within 2 years compared to patients who had
CSU lasting 10 years or longer (22+16 years). Due to
the large standard deviation, we cannot make definitive
statements, however these findings may suggest that
younger age of CSU onset is a risk for prolonged disease
course.

About one-third of patients had recurrence of their
disease after going into remission, with duration of
remission lasting nearly 2 years on average and total

 

 

 

median duration of disease lasting about 8 years
(including remission time). Patients with recurrence of
their CSU also had a higher proportion of patients with
disease lasting 10 years or longer (33%), compared to
those without disease recurrence (10%) (p=0.033). This
is a significant finding as details on long term prognosis
of patients with CSU is limited. The natural history
of the disease process may be longer than previously
reported and include more of a relapsing/remitting
course. Multiple previous studies that evaluated the
natural history of CSU do not comment on recurrence
rates after the initial remission, and have generally only
followed patients for a few years after diagnosis [3, 6, 7].
Neither response to second generation antihistamines,
co-existing angioedema nor autoimmune/thyroid disease
were observed to be predictors of disease recurrence
with comparable rates of recurrence in these groups
compared to the entire CSU study population. We did
observe a higher reported rate of sleep disturbance (91%)
in patients with CSU recurrence. There is currently very
limited data on predicators of relapse of CSU, and at
this time only disease duration and baseline UAS7 are
thought to be predictors of relapse, similar to what we
observed [25].

Patients with angioedema had a median duration
of CSU of 4.2 years and also had a larger proportion of
patients with CSU lasting 10 years (25%) compared to
those who did not have angioedema (4%) (p=0.036).
Previous studies have also reported that patients with
co-existing angioedema are more likely to have a longer
disease course [3]. We also found that patients with
co-morbid autoimmune or thyroid disease had a median
duration of CSU of just over 3 years. However due to
the large variability of data and our small sample size,
this was not statistically significantly lower than those
without co-morbid autoimmune or thyroid disease.

Of note, the range of disease length varied widely in all
our groups of patients making conclusive statistical
analyses difficult in our small study population. Neither
angioedema nor co-morbid autoimmune/thyroid
disease were associated with differences in quality of
life indicators (sleep disturbance or emergency room
visits) or with therapeutic response to second generation
antihistamines.

The impact on quality of life was observed to be quite
high in our patient population, with three-quarters
of our patients reporting sleep disturbance due to the
symptoms of CSU. This is a higher proportion than
what has previously been reported in the literature
{15]. This is a significant finding as it emphasises the
humanistic burden that CSU can have and the difficulties
in controlling symptoms. In addition, 43% of patients in
this study reported a need to visit an emergency room
for assistance in control of their symptoms. This is also
a higher finding than reported in previous studies [16].
We also observed that patients with CSU recurrence
reported a higher rate of sleep disturbance (91%) than
patients without sleep disturbance (68%) (p=0.038)
which may suggest that patients with recurrent CSU

may have more difficult to control symptoms. Again,
however our study population is likely to have a more
severe disease course than the entire population with
CSU as we are a specialist clinic and are more likely to be
referred patients with more severe/persistent symptoms.
Although CSU can generally be managed in an outpatient
setting, it can create a heavy burden on health care
resources if inadequately controlled. Overall, analysis of
the data from our study emphasized the high direct and
indirect costs that CSU can have on both the patient and
health care system, and the importance in controlling the
disease to mitigate these costs.

There has also been strong links found between CSU
and autoimmunity. Another large Israeli populationbased study that spanned 17 years and involving
thousands of patients diagnosed with CSU found that
patients with CSU were observed to have increased
odds of co-existing hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism,
and antithyroid antibodies [26]. In addition, female
patients with CSU had a significantly higher incidence
of rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome,
celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, and systemic lupus
erythematous. Most of these autoimmune conditions
Stepaniuk et al. Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol (2020) 16:63

were diagnosed within the 10 years succeeding the
CSU [26]. We found similar findings as 18% of our
CSU patients had coexisting autoimmune disease
with hypothyroidism and rheumatoid arthritis being
most common (8% and 7% respectively). We could
not identify any significant differences in our patients
with co-morbid autoimmune disease compared to
those without co-morbid disease as these two groups
had similar rates of recurrence rates, quality of life
indicators and response to antihistamine therapy.
However, as we only had 14 CSU patients with
co-morbid autoimmune thyroid disease, we may have
not had a large enough sample size to see statistically
significant differences.

The treatment of CSU observed in this study
paralleled the recommended published guidelines,
with nearly all patients having tried second
generation antihistamines followed by first generation
antihistamines, prednisone and omalizumab [1].
However, patient reported response rates to these
common pharmacologic therapies ranged from 73
to 84%. Omalizumab was approved for treatment
of chronic spontaneous urticaria in August 2014
in Canada. As this data was collected shortly after
drug approval, the proportion of patients who
trailed treatment with omalizumab versus other
immunosuppressive medications is likely lower in this
study than it would be if the same data was collected
today. Although only a few patients had trialed
cyclosporine, all of those patients reported relief of their
symptoms from its use. There were a smaller number
of patients trialed on treatment with methotrexate,
IVIG and montelukast and interpretation of response
to these medications is limited by the small sample
size. These findings suggest that even with treatment
regimens that follow consensus guidelines, about onefifth of patients do not report symptomatic response to
treatment. This may explain why some patients seek out
complementary and alternative medicine for assistance
in relief of symptoms. Unfortunately, for patients that
trial alternative medicine, their reported response rates
are even lower with only 20-29% of patients reporting
benefit in our study. This would be consistent with the
inconclusive studies in acupuncture and traditional
Chinese medicine [19-23]. Although, 21% of our
patients reported visiting a naturopath, we could not
find any studies in the literature that have studied the
use of and effectiveness of naturopathic therapies in
the treatment of CSU. Because of the relatively low
response rates to these multiple alternative therapies,
their use should be discouraged.

Although this is a relatively small analysis, we feel that
this adds to the growing body of evidence about CSU.

Limitations of this study include the small sample size
and single centre origin which makes generalizability to
the general population difficult. In addition, there is likely
a component of selection bias as patients were required
to volunteer to complete the survey and participate in
the study. This may predispose individuals who have
had a more difficult time controlling their symptoms
agreeing to participate in the study. In addition, our study
population is based on referrals to an allergy specialist
referral centre and are therefore also more likely to have
severe disease.

Conclusions

CSU has been shown to disproportionately affect
females with an average onset of disease in the fifth
decade and generally similar rates among various
ethnicities. We believe that the natural history of
CSU may be longer than previously reported with
our study showing a median duration of symptoms of
4 years and one-third of patients having a relapsing/
remitting course. Patients with a relapsing/remitting
disease course and those with co-existing angioedema
trended towards a longer median duration of CSU
and were observed to have a higher proportion of
patients reporting CSU duration of 10 years or longer.
Patients with co-existing autoimmune/thyroid disease
trended towards a shorter median duration of CSU.
There was also a trend of older age of CSU diagnosis
being associated with more rapid CSU resolution
(within 2 years) whereas those diagnosed with CSU
at a younger age trended towards a longer disease
course (10 years or greater). There was a relatively high
humanistic burden of disease with 75% of patients
reporting inadequate symptom control disrupting
their sleep as well as significant utilization of health
care resources (i.e. emergency room visits) for patients
with uncontrolled symptoms, particularly in those
with a relapsing/remitting disease course. Reported
symptomatic benefit was higher from guideline based
pharmacologic therapy versus various alternative
medicines with response rates to antihistamines similar
amongst different subgroups of patients. CSU can have
a significant impact on quality of life if it is inadequately
controlled and even with following guideline-based
therapy, symptoms can be difficult to abate in a subset
of the population.
