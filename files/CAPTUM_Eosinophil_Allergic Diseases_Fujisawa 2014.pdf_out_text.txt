Background: Wheal reactions to intradermally injected
neuropeptides, such as substance P (SP) and vasoactive
intestinal peptide, are significantly larger and longer lasting in
patients with chronic urticaria (CU) than in nonatopic control
(NC) subjects. Mas-related gene X2 (MrgX2) has been identified
as a receptor for basic neuropeptides, such as SP and vasoactive
intestinal peptide. Mast cell (MC) responsiveness to eosinophil
mediators contributes to the late-phase reaction of allergy.
Objective: We sought to compare the frequency of MrgX2
expression in skin MCs from patients with CU and NC subjects
and to identify the receptor for basic eosinophil granule proteins
on human skin MCs.

Methods: MrgX2 expression was investigated by using
immunofluorescence in skin tissues from NC subjects and
patients with severe CU and on skin-derived cultured MCs.
MrgX2 expression in human MCs was reduced by using a
lentiviral small hairpin RNA silencing technique. Ca?* influx
was measured in CHO cells transfected with MrgX2 in response
to eosinophil granule proteins. Histamine and prostaglandin D2
levels were measured by using enzyme immunoassays.

Results: The number of MrgX2* skin MCs and the percentage
of MrgX2* MCs in all MCs in patients with CU were
significantly greater than those in NC subjects. Eosinophil

infiltration in urticarial lesions was observed in 7 of 9 patients
with CU. SP, major basic protein, and eosinophil peroxidase, but
not eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, induced histamine release
from human skin MCs through MrgX2.

Conclusion: MrgX2 might be a new target molecule for the
treatment of wheal reactions in patients with severe CU. (J
Allergy Clin Immunol 2014;134:622-33.)

Chronic urticaria (CU) is defined as the occurrence of systemic
daily wheals for at least 6 weeks.' Mast cells (MCs) play a key
role in the induction of wheal reactions through the release of a
variety of vasoactive autacoid mediators and functionally diverse
proteases, chemokines, and cytokines.” The condition is known to
have an autoimmune basis in 30% to 50% of patients with CU
because these patients exhibit autoantibodies against either the
high-affinity IgE receptor FceRI or, less commonly, IgE.'* The
remaining approximately 50% of patients with CU have truly
“idiopathic” conditions.’

Patients with CU reportedly exhibit enhanced wheal reactions
compared with healthy control subjects, when some neuropeptides, such as substance P (SP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide
(VIP), are intradermally injected.*° The mastocytoma cell line
HMC-1, which does not express FceRI on its cell surface, is
reportedly activated by sera from patients with CU,° suggesting
that an FceRI-independent MC activation mechanism might be
involved in the pathogenesis of CU. Human skin MCs, but not
lung MCs, are activated by neuropeptides, such as SP, VIP, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, and somatostatin,
but not neurokinin-A or neurokinin-B, resulting in degranulation.”* Although the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R) is a receptor
for SP, SP-induced histamine release from human skin MCs is not
blocked by an NK-1R-specific antagonist.’ Mas-related gene X2
(MrgX2) is a member of the Mas-related gene family and is primarily expressed in human dorsal root ganglia, and a subgroup of
these receptors (MrgX1-MrgX4) is expressed in human, but not
murine, neurons.'°'' Recently, MrgX2 was found to be a receptor
for basic peptides, including SP, VIP, cortistatin, somatostatin,
and compound 48/80, in human cord blood (CB)-derived
cultured MCs.'* An MrgX2-transfected, but not an MrgX1transfected, rat basophilic cell line (RBL-2H3) exhibited degranulation after activation with SP.'* Therefore we hypothesized that

Cytokine production by MC activation induces a late-phase
allergic reaction that occurs 6 to 9 hours after the acute allergic
reaction and is characterized by tissue infiltration by inflammatory
cells, mainly eosinophils, CD4* T cells, and neutrophils. '*'° In patients with CU, eosinophil infiltration is commonly observed.'*'”
Studies showing the marked deposition of major basic protein
(MBP) and eosinophil cationic protein in CU lesions'*”° have provided evidence that eosinophil granule proteins are released and
could contribute to local inflammatory processes in patients with
chronic idiopathic urticaria either directly or indirectly through other
inflammatory cells. MBP activates human heart and lung MCs cocultured with lung fibroblasts.”'** Thus we hypothesized that
MrgX2 is a receptor for basic eosinophil granule proteins.

Generation of CB-derived cultured MCs

Human CB CD34* cells were obtained from RIKEN BioResource Center
(Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan). Human CB CD34* cells were cultured in
serum-free Iscove methylcellulose medium (Stem Cell Technologies,
Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) and Iscove modified Dulbecco
medium (IMDM) containing recombinant human (rh) stem cell factor (SCF;
PeproTech, London, United Kingdom) at 200 ng/mL, rhIL-6 (PeproTech) at
50 ng/mL, and rhIL-3 (Intergen, Purchase, NY) at 1 ng/mL, as previously
described.°* On day 42, methylcellulose was dissolved in PBS, and cells
were resuspended and cultured in IMDM containing 0.1% BSA, 100 ng/mL.
rhSCF, and 50 ng/mL rhIL-6. The purity of human MCs, as assessed by using
metachromatic staining, was greater than 98%.

Isolation, purification, and culture of human lung
and skin MCs

Macroscopically normal human lung or skin tissue was obtained during
surgery. Skin tissues for the isolation and culture of MCs were obtained from
healthy donors. Lung and skin cells were dispersed from chopped lung
specimens and foreskin specimens by using an enzymatic procedure in IMDM
containing 1.5 mg/mL collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Mo), 0.75
mg/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.1% BSA at 37°C for 1 hour.’
The dispersed cells were then centrifuged in lymphocyte separation medium
(Organon Teknika, Durham, NC). Cells at the lymphocyte separation medium
interface were collected and washed, as described previously.”’ Dispersed
lung or skin cells were cultured in serum-free Iscove methylcellulose medium
and IMDM supplemented with 200 ng/mL rhSCF and 50 ng/mL rhIL-6, as
mentioned above.

 

Flow cytometric analysis

The expressions of MrgX2, FceRIa, and NK-1R on the cell surface were
analyzed by using flow cytometric analysis. Briefly, MCs were collected and
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at 4°C. Then the MCs were
treated with Human TruStain FcX (BioLegend, San Diego, Calif). The cells
were washed and resuspended in 0.1% BSA-PBS. Unlabeled anti-MrgX2
mAb, anti-NK-1R polyclonal antibody, or biotinylated anti-FceRIa mAb was
added to the cell suspension, and the cells were incubated for 30 minutes at
4°C. After washing, the cells, which were stained with anti-MrgX2 mAb, and
anti-NK-1IR polyclonal antibody, were incubated with phycoerythrinconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG mAb (BD Bioscience, San Jose, Calif) and
biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif) for
30 minutes at 4°C, respectively. Cells stained with biotinylated anti-FceRIa
mAb and biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG were incubated with phycoerythrinconjugated streptavidin (BD Biosciences) for 30 minutes at 4°C. In some
experiments intracellular staining was performed with the BD Cytofix/
Cytoperm Kit (BD Biosciences). The expression on MCs was detected by
using the FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo software
(Tree Star, Ashland, Ore).

Immunofluorescence analysis

We studied 9 patients with CU (5S female and 4 male patients; age range,
24-69 years) and 13 nonatopic control (NC) subjects (6 female and 7 male
subjects; age range, 27-85 years). The characteristics of the patients with CU
and NC subjects are summarized in Tables | and II. Patients with CU were
treated with histamine H1 receptor antagonist and histamine H2 receptor
antagonist, leukotriene receptor antagonist, cyclosporine, tranexamic acid,
or betamethasone. Despite treatment, the wheal reactions occurred daily.
The severity was determined based on Urticaria Activity Score 7 (UAS7)
(Table I). The UAS7 is a patient-reported scoring system that captures the
severity of pruritus and the number of hives during 1 week.”°*° The intensity
of pruritus (range, 0 [none] to 3 [severe]) and the number of hives (range,
0 [none] to 3 [>12 hives]) are recorded daily (maximum, 6 points per day).
Scores are then summed for | week to represent the UAS7 (scale, 0-42).
Severe CU was defined as a UAS7 of greater than 30. Patients also underwent
an autologous serum skin test and blood tests, which included total IgE and

specific IgE titers against 33 common allergens (MAST33; SRL, Tokyo,
Japan). Skin tissue sections were obtained by using punch biopsy specimens
from wheal regions on the arms, legs, or trunks of 9 patients with CU. Skin
specimens from the arms, legs, or trunks of NC subjects were obtained from
macroscopically normal skin tissue from surplus skin grafts. Frozen skin
tissue sections (4 ym) were prepared with a cryostat and fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde or periodate lysine paraformaldehyde (for staining with
anti-PGP 9.5 mAb). The sections were then blocked with 2% nonfat
skim milk in PBS for 1 hour at 37°C and then incubated with Alexa Fluor
488-conjugated anti-human tryptase mAb, biotinylated anti-human MrgX2
antibody, biotinylated anti-human ECP antibody, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated
anti-human PGP 9.5 mAb, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-CD3-¢ mAb,

488-conjugated mouse IgG), biotinylated rabbit IgG, and biotinylated mouse
IgG, were used in the experiment. After washing, the sections were incubated
with Cy3-conjugated streptavidin (BioLegend) for 30 minutes at room
temperature. LAD2 cells and peripheral blood (PB)-derived cultured MCs
were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at 4°C and then treated
with Perm/Wash Buffer (BD Biosciences) for 5 minutes at room temperature.
The cells were washed and resuspended in 0.1% BSA in PBS, incubated with
anti-human MrgX2 antibody for 30 minutes at 4°C and washed, and then
incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody for 30 minutes

at 4°C. After washing, the LAD2 cells and PB-derived cultured MCs
were incubated with Cy3-conjugated streptavidin for 30 minutes at room temperature. The sections, LAD2 cells, and PB-derived cultured MCs were
mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent with 4'-6-diamidino-2phenylindole dihydrochloride (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif). A fluorescence
microscope (IX71; Olympus, Tokyo Japan) was used. All immunostained
sections were evaluated by 2 observers, who were blind to the clinical data
of the patients.

Purification of eosinophil granule basic proteins

The 3 proteins, MBP, eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), and eosinophil-derived
neurotoxin (EDN), which constitute the main basic proteins of the specific
eosinophil granule, were purified to homogeneity from the eosinophils of
patients with PB eosinophilia, as previously described.”

MC activation

MCs were suspended in HEPES buffer supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 1
mmol/L CaCl, for histamine and prostaglandin (PG) D2 experiments. MCs
were challenged by means of incubation with SP (Sigma-Aldrich), eosinophil
cationic proteins (MBP, EPO, and EDN: 10-100 g/mL), or the calcium ionophore A23187 «o-® mol/L, Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C for 30 minutes for measurement of histamine release and PGD, synthesis. After incubation, cell-free
culture supernatants and cell pellets were harvested to measure mediator
levels. In some experiments the MCs were pretreated with an NK-1R antagonist, CP-96345 (1, 3, and 10 jxmol/L; Sigma-Aldrich), for 30 minutes, and then
the cells were activated with SP (3 mol/L) for 30 minutes. In some experiments skin MCs were pretreated with the histamine HI receptor antagonist
olopatadine hydrochloride (10 pmol/L; Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, United
Kingdom) or the histamine H2 receptor antagonist famotidine (10 jzmol/L;
LKT Laboratories, St Paul, Minn) for 30 minutes or with dexamethasone
(10 pmol/L; Cayman, Ann Arbor, Mich) for 16 hours before challenge with
SP. The concentrations and incubation times for the drugs were determined
based on previous reports. ”*

Statistical analysis

Differences in the numbers of skin MCs, MrgX2* MCs, and eosinophils
and the percentage of MrgX2* MCs in all MCs between NC subjects and patients with CU were evaluated by using the Mann-Whitney U test. Differences
among 3 independent in vitro experiments were analyzed by using the MannWhitney U test. Differences between 2 paired groups of in vitro experiments
J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL

were analyzed by using the unpaired Student f test. A P value of less than .05
was considered significant.

RESULTS
MrgX2 is expressed on the cell surface of
skin-derived, but not lung-derived, cultured MCs
To evaluate the expression profile of MrgX2 in human MCs, we
developed CB-, skin-, and lung-derived cultured MCs and
compared expression levels of MrgX2 among LAD2 cells and
CB-, skin-, and lung-derived cultured MCs. Because LAD2 cells
reportedly express MrgX2 mRNA,** the expression level of
MrgX2 mRNA was designated as 1. In accordance with our
previous report,** the expression level of MrgX2 mRNA in
skin-derived cultured MCs was much higher than that in lungderived cultured MCs (Fig |, A). As shown in Fig |, B, MrgX2
expression was detected on the cell surface of LAD2 cells and
CB- and skin-derived, but not lung-derived, cultured MCs. An
immunocytochemical analysis was performed with anti-MrgX2
antibody to analyze the localization of MrgX2 in LAD2 cells.
MrgX2 mainly appeared to be localized in the cytoplasm of
LAD2 cells (Fig 1, C). Because SP-induced histamine release
from human skin MCs is reportedly not blocked by an NK-1R—
specific antagonist,’ NK-1R expression was analyzed on skinand lung-derived cultured MCs by using fluorescence-activated
cell sorting. Neither skin-derived nor lung-derived cultured
MCs expressed NK-1R on cell surfaces, but a positive control,
Jurkat cells, expressed NK-1IR (Fig |, D).

MrgX2 is expressed in MCs of patients with CU

To evaluate the frequency of MrgX2* MCs in skin tissues, we
performed immunofluorescence staining using anti-MrgX2 and
anti-tryptase antibodies (Fig 2). We compared the expression of
MrgX2 in skin MCs between NC subjects (Fig 2, A) and patients
with CU (Fig 2, B). The numbers of skin MCs (tryptase-positive
cells: green cells in Fig 2, A and B) were not significantly different
in skin tissues from the NC subjects (316 + 251 cells/mm’, median and interquartile range) and patients with CU (256 + 35.2
cells/mm”; Fig 2, D). However, the number of MrgX2* MCs (yellow cells in Fig 2, B-c) was significantly greater in skin tissues
from patients with CU (116 + 19.0 cells/mm?) than in NC subjects (68.5 + 51.1 cells/mm?; Fig 2, E). MrgX2 in skin MCs
from skin tissues appeared to be localized in cytoplasm, showing
a pattern of localization similar to that of MrgX2 in LAD2 cells
(Fig 1, C). The percentage of MrgX2* MCs in all the MCs in patients with CU (47.0% + 6.9%) was significantly higher than that
in the NC subjects (21.6% + 7.8%; Fig 2, F).

The average age of the patients with CU was 45.1 years (Table
I). On the other hand, the average age of the NC subjects was 66.5
years. To evaluate the effect of age on the number of MrgX2*
MCs and the percentage of MrgX2* MCs in all MCs, we
compared these values between patients with CU less than 50
years of age and those greater than 50 years of age. As can be
seen in Fig El in this article’s Online Repository at www.
jacionline.org, no significant difference in the number of MrgX2*
MCs and the percentage of MrgX2* MCs was seen in all the MCs
between the 2 age groups. Furthermore, we compared the number
of MrgX2* MCs and the percentage of MrgX2* MCs among all

FUJISAWA ET AL 625

MCs between NC subjects less than 35 years of age and those
greater than 35 years of age. No significant difference in either
parameter was observed between the 2 age groups (see Fig E2
in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org).

We calculated the distribution of the number of MrgX2* cells
in skin tissues. The MrgX2~ nerve cells in patients with CU (see
Fig E3 in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org)
and the NC subjects (data not shown) accounted for about 12.8%
and 13.3% of the MrgX2°* cells, respectively (mean of 2-3 donors, data not shown). Therefore the majority of MrgX2* cells
in the skin were MCs. Because Allia et al” reported that lymphocytes and endothelial cells express MrgX2 protein in gastrointestinal ganglion cells based on a histochemical analysis, we
performed dual staining of the skin specimens from patients
with CU (n = 3 donors) with anti-MrgX2 antibody and anti—
CD3-¢ mAb or anti-von Willebrand factor mAb. We could not
find any MrgX2* lymphocytes or MrgX2* endothelial cells in
our experiments (data not shown). No other cells, except for nerve
cells and MCs, expressed MrgX2.

Skin-derived cultured MCs were activated with SP
through MrgX2 but not through NK-1R

We hypothesized that skin MC activation induced by stimulation with SP occurs through MrgX2. Therefore to analyze the
functions of MrgX2 in SP-induced MC activation, we knocke
down the expression of MrgX2 on skin-derived cultured MCs
using a lentiviral small hairpin RNA (shRNA) technique. In Fig 3,
A, the MrgX2 expression level was reduced on skin-derive
cultured MCs transduced with MrgX2 shRNA compared with
nontransduced and nontargeted shRNA-transduced skin-derive
cultured MCs. We observed a significant reduction in the cellsurface MrgX2 expression level on MrgX2 shRNA-transduce
MCs compared with that seen in nontransduced and nontargete
shRNA-transduced MCs (Fig 3, C). However, FceRI expression
was not affected by the transduction of MrgX2 shRNA (Fig 3,
B). We stimulated MCs with SP and analyzed the degranulation
and PGD» production of skin-derived cultured MCs transduce
with nontargeted shRNA and MrgX2 shRNA or without viral
treatment. Both degranulation and PGD, production were significantly reduced in the skin-derived cultured MCs transduced with
MrgX2 shRNA compared with that seen in nontransduced an
nontargeted shRNA-transduced MCs (Fig 3, D).

To investigate whether the SP-induced activation of skinderived cultured MCs occurs independently of NK-1R, we
measured histamine release from MCs after stimulation with SP
in the presence or absence of CP-96345, which is a specific
inhibitor of human NK-1R. SP-induced histamine release was not
inhibited in the presence of CP-96345 (Fig 3, E), indicating that
SP-mediated skin-derived MC activation does not occur through
NK-IR.

 

Eosinophil infiltration and colocalization of MCs
and eosinophils in urticarial regions of patients
with CU

In patients with CU, eosinophil infiltration and MC degranulation are commonly observed in the urticarial region.'"° We
counted the number of eosinophils in the urticarial region and
in skin from NC subjects (Fig 4, A, C, and £, and Tables | and
I). No eosinophil infiltration was observed in skin from NC

MBP and EPO induced histamine release from

To investigate whether eosinophil granule proteins activate
cells through MrgX2, we first established a system for measuring
Ca?* influx using CHO cells transfected with MrgX2. In
response to SP, CHO cells transfected with MrgX2, but not

with vector alone, increased Ca?* influx (Fig 5, A). Using these
MrgX2-transfected CHO cells, we measured the Ca?* influx in
response to eosinophil granule proteins. MBP and EPO, but not
EDN, induced Ca?” influx in a concentration-dependent manner
(Fig 5, B). To analyze the functions of MrgX2 in MBP- and EPOinduced MC activation, we downregulated the expression of

DISCUSSION

In this study we demonstrated that the number and percentage
of MrgX2* MCs in patients with severe CU were significantly
higher than those in NC subjects (Fig 2). The skin-derived
cultured MCs expressed MrgX2 on the cell surface, whereas the
lung-derived cultured MCs did not (Fig |). Histamine release

from the skin-derived cultured MCs induced by SP was independent of the traditional SP receptor NK-1R (Figs 2 and 3). We
further generated MrgX2-knockdown skin-derived cultured
MCs using an shRNA technique (Fig 3, A and C) and demonstrated that MrgX2 is a responsible receptor for SP-induced histamine release and PGD, production in skin-derived cultured MCs.

Ca?* levels were measured. Data were shown as the relative fluorescent unit (RFU; percentage of intracellular Ca?* increase by 1 mol/L of the calcium ionophore A23187). C, Effect of diminution of MrgX2 on histamine release from skin-derived cultured MCs in response to eosinophil granule proteins. Levels of
histamine release of nontransduced, nontargeted shRNA-transduced, and MrgX2 shRNA-transduced
skin-derived cultured MCs are shown as white, gray, and black bars, respectively. Three independent experiments were performed with 3 independent donors. Data are shown as means + SEMs. *P< .05.

In patients with CU, eosinophil infiltration and colocalization of
MCs and eosinophils in the urticarial region were observed (Fig
4). Eosinophil granule proteins, including MBP and EPO,
induced histamine release through MrgX2 (Fig 5). Taken
together, these results suggest that MrgX2-mediated MC activation induced by stimulation with basic neuropeptides and eosinophil granule proteins might be involved in the pathogenesis of
severe CU.

The increased expression of MrgX2 in skin MCs of patients with
severe CU was confirmed by counting the number of MrgX2*
tryptase-positive cells by means of immunohistochemistry

 

(Fig 2). Numbers of skin MCs were not significantly different in
skin tissues from NC subjects and patients with severe CU (Fig
2, D). This is in agreement with previous reports.'’*’ Because
the density of MCs in the NC subjects varied, we examined the biopsy sites shown in Fig 2, D, to determine whether this variation
might depend on the anatomic site of the biopsy specimen. We
compared the density of MCs from biopsy specimens of the
arms, legs, and trunks of NC subjects (see Fig E4, A, in this article’s
Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). Fig 2, D, and Fig E4, A,
clearly show that the density of the MCs did not depend on the biopsy site. Furthermore, we compared the density of the MCs from

 
J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL
VOLUME 134, NUMBER 3

trunk biopsy specimens between NC subjects (n = 8) and patients
with CU (n = 4) and found no significant difference (see Fig E4, B).
The density of the MCs from biopsy specimens taken from the
trunks of NC subjects varied (see Fig E4, B), suggesting that the
MC density seems to depend on the donor.

To investigate whether MC phenotypes differ according to
anatomic site, we compared the MC; phenotype (tryptase singlepositive MCs) and the MCrc phenotype (tryptase and chymase
double-positive MCs) in skin biopsy specimens from the arms,
legs, and trunks of NC subjects using an immunohistochemical
technique (see Fig E5, A-C, in this article’s Online Repository
at www.jacionline.org). We found that the percentages of the
MC rc phenotype in skin biopsy specimens of the arms, legs,
and trunks of NC subjects were 96.3%, 93.4%, and 92.1%, respectively (1 specimen from each donor). The percentage of the MCrc
phenotype in the skin biopsy specimens of the arms, legs and
trunks of patients with CU were 96.2%, 93.6%, and 95.2%,
respectively (1 from each donor; see Fig E6, A-C, in this article’s
Online Repository at www.jacionline.org), indicating that the MC
phenotypes do not differ according to anatomic site, irrespective
of whether the donors are NC subjects or patients with CU.
Because patients were treated with a wide range of drugs, we
examined the effect of the histamine H1 receptor antagonist
olopatadine hydrochloride, the histamine H2 receptor antagonist
amotidine, and dexamethasone on MrgX2 expression levels on
uman skin MCs and a suboptimal concentration (0.3 mol/L) of
SP-induced histamine release from skin MCs (see Fig E7, A and
C, in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org).
These drugs did not upregulate MrgX2 expression levels, and
they did not affect SP-induced histamine release under our experimental conditions. However, we cannot exclude the possibility
that the treatment might have influenced the results.

Why does the expression of MrgX2 in skin MCs from patients
with severe CU increase significantly? The mechanisms responsible for regulating the expression of MrgX2 have not been
previously reported. Histamine is a neurotransmitter that can
potentially be found in the same microenvironment as SP.
Epithelial cells reportedly communicate directly with cutaneous
sensory neurons through thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)
to promote itching.** In addition, the epithelium-derived cytokine
IL-33 directly stimulates human MCs to produce T};2-type cytokines.*? Thus we examined the effect of histamine, SP, TSLP,
IL-33, and the simultaneous addition of TSLP and IL-33 on the
MrgX2 expression level of skin MCs and found that these neurotransmitters and cytokines did not have any effect under our
in vitro experimental conditions (see Fig E7, B). Further investigation is needed to clarify the regulatory mechanisms of
MrgX2 expression.

Although the distribution of age among the NC subjects tended
to be relatively older than that of the patients with CU, there was
no significant difference in the number and percentage of
MrgX2* MCs between patients with CU less than 50 years of
age and those greater than 50 years of age (see Fig E1). No significant differences in the number of MrgX2* MCs and the percentage of MrgX2* MCs among all MCs were observed between NC
subjects less than 35 years of age and those older than 35 years
(see Fig E2). Because the MrgX2* nerve cells accounted for
12% to 13% of all MrgX2" cells in the skin of both NC subjects
and patients with CU and the number of MCs was not significantly
different between the NC subjects and the patients with CU, the
increased expression of MrgX2 in the skin MCs of patients with

 

 

FUJISAWA ET AL 631

CU might explain the phenomena, accounting for the significantly
larger and longer-lasting wheal reactions in response to intradermally injected basic neuropeptides, such as SP and VIP, in patients with CU than in NC subjects.*° Which molecules
activate skin MCs when anti-FceRIa or anti-IgE autoantibodies
are absent remains an unanswered question. Although various
neuropeptides, such as SP, VIP,’ and calcitonin gene-related peptide,’ have been reportedly involved in the pathogenesis of CU,
serum levels of SP are not increased."” The mean plasma SP levels
of healthy subjects and patients with CU were 290 and 222
pg/mL, respectively." Because MCs are located close to nerve
fibers,*! the concentration of SP at the nerve ending in urticarial
regions might be much higher than plasma concentrations.

MrgX2 is reportedly a receptor for basic peptides, including SP,
VIP, cortistatin, somatostatin, and compound 48/80, on human
CB-derived cultured MCs.'**"* These basic peptides share little
structural homology.'* The median effective concentration values
of the ligands for the activation of MrgX2-expressing cells and
human CB-derived cultured MCs are between 10~* and 10°°
mol/L, which is considerably higher than those for the activation
of typical G protein-coupled receptors, such as neuropeptide receptors.'* Pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins seem to be
involved in the activation of MrgX2-expressing cells and human
CB-derived cultured MCs through basic secretagogues.'~
A pertussis toxin-sensitive G; protein, Gj3, interacts with MBP
to trigger human CB-derived cultured MCs.** Thus we hypothesized that this protein could serve as a receptor for basic eosinophil granule proteins.

MBP and EPO, but not EDN, induced histamine release from
human skin MCs through MrgX2. The highly cationic nature of
the proteins might explain their interaction with MrgX2 because
the isoelectric point values of MBP, the light chain of EPO, and
the heavy chains of EPO, EDN, and SP are 10.9, 10.7, 10.8, 8.9,
and 9.4, respectively.*“° Indeed, the proportion of strongly basic
amino acids (arginine and lysine) of MBP, the light chain of EPO,
and the heavy chain of EPO and EDN are 14.5%, 15.3%, 15.5%
and 8.9%, respectively.’*“° Strongly basic amino acid residues
might be required for the basic peptides or proteins to act as
MrgX2 agonists.

Variable degrees of eosinophils were present, and eosinophils
are often activated in the urticarial region in patients with
cu.'8°*? MBP can be measured in wheals, even when blood
eosinophilia is not detected.'* We observed the colocalization
of MCs and eosinophils in wheal regions. Intercellular
MC-eosinophil communication through physical interactions
reportedly takes place in the allergic response and exerts functional bidirectional changes on the cells, suggesting that this
enhanced functional activity might critically contribute to the
perpetuation of the inflammatory response in allergic conditions.“*°° Recent studies’! have suggested that activated eosinophils might play a potentially relevant role in the pathogenesis of
CU in triggering the tissue factor pathway of the coagulation
cascade and as a source of vascular endothelial growth factor.
We further clarified the role of eosinophils in the pathogenesis
of CU. Frigas et al™* originally described increased MBP concentrations (up to 100 g/mL) in sputum from patients with bronchial
asthma. Ponikau et al°° reported that nasal secretions from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis contained MBP concentrations
of up to 10 pg/mL. Nair et al”° reported that the EPO levels in
sputum from asthmatic patients were as high as 10 wg/mL. The
skin tissue concentrations of MBP and EPO might be even higher
632 FUJISAWA ET AL

than these concentrations in secretions (sputum and nasal secretions). Because eosinophils are recruited to sites of inflammation
during the late or chronic phase of allergic reactions,'> skin MC
responsiveness to MBP and EPO through MrgX2 might
contribute to the late or chronic phase of wheal reactions in
patients with CU.

Lung MCs, which express almost the same amount of MrgX2
mRNA as LAD? cells (Fig 1, A), do not display any surface protein (Fig 1, B). Lung MCs are not activated by SP.”* SP does not
activate human adult PB-derived cultured MCs.”’ Because of the
limited availability of human lung MCs, we used PB-derived
cultured MCs to investigate the intracellular location of MrgX2
protein, and human PB-derived cultured MCs were found to express MrgX2 mRNA abundantly (see Fig E8, A, in this article’s
Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). We confirmed that
PB-derived cultured MCs do not express MrgX2 on their cell surfaces (see Fig E8, B). However, using permeabilized MCs, we
found that MrgX2 protein, which was recognized by an antiMrgX2 mAb, was expressed intracellularly (see Fig E8, B). We
also confirmed the intracellular expression of MrgX2 protein,
which was recognized by an anti-MrgX2 polyclonal antibody
with an immunocytochemical technique (see Fig E8, C). These
data indicate that MrgX2 is not located on the cell surfaces of
PB-derived cultured MCs and that ligands cannot access the intracellular receptor.

In summary, a significantly higher expression of MrgX2 was
observed in skin MCs from patients with severe CU than from NC
subjects. Human skin MCs express functional MrgX2, which
induces rapid degranulation in response to not only SP but also
MBP and EPO. Therefore the blockage of MrgX2 on human skin
MCs might offer a novel approach to the prevention and treatment
of severe CU.

We thank the staffs of the Departments of Dermatology and Urology of
Nihon University Hospital for supplying the human specimens and for their
willing and capable assistance.

METHODS

Generation of adult PB-derived cultured MCs
Lineage-negative (CD4", CD8", CDI1b ', CD14", CD16, and CD19")
mononuclear cells were selected from the PB mononuclear cells and cultured
in serum-free Iscove methylcellulose medium (Stem Cell Technologies) and
IMDM containing recombinant rhSCF (PeproTech) at 200 ng/mL, rhIL-6
(PeproTech) at 50 ng/mL, and rhIL-3 (PeproTech) at | ng/mL, as previously
described.”! On culture day 42, methylcellulose was dissolved in PBS, and the
cells were resuspended and cultured in IMDM containing 100 ng/mL rhSCF
and 50 ng/mL rhIL-6 with 2% FCS. Cultured MC numbers and purity were determined by counting after metachromatic staining with toluidine blue (Kimura
stain)” or by means of tryptase staining (clone AA1; DakoCytomation).

Fibroblasts

Fresh samples of synovial tissues were obtained after total-knee arthroplasty at the Nihon University and after obtaining informed consent. Synovial
fibroblasts were obtained after the culture of enzymatically dispersed synovial
cells."

RNA isolation and real-time quantitative RT-PCR
Total cellular RNA was isolated from MCs, and PCR was performed, as
previously described." The primers used were as follows: MrgX2
sense primer (5'-GCCCATCTGGTATCGC-3’) and antisense primer
(5'-GGGTTGGCACTGCTGTTAAGA-3') and NK-IR sense primer
(5'-TCTTCTTCCTCCTGCCCTACATC-3’) and antisense primer (5'-AG
CACCGGAAGGCATGCTTGAAGCCCA-3’; Invitrogen). Human genespecific primers and probe sets for TaqMan analysis for MrgX2 and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were designed by using the
Assays-on-Demand service (Applied Biosystems, Santa Clara, Calif).

Lentivirus shRNA vector construction and gene

transduction

The lentiviral expression vector with the sense and antisense oligonucleotide sequences for the construction of MrgX2 shRNA (MISSION shRNA.
plasmid DNA, catalog no. TRCN0000357642) was purchased from SigmaAldrich. The packaging vector (MISSION lentiviral packaging mix; SigmaAldrich) and the lentiviral expression vector (pLKO-puro) with MrgX2
shRNA or the MISSION nontargeted shRNA control vector (Sigma-Aldrich)
were cotransfected into 293T packaging cells with TransIT (TaKaRa Bio,
Shiga, Japan), as previously described.'° After 6 hours, the culture supernatants were changed, and after 48 hours, the samples were centrifuged at
3000 rpm for 10 minutes and filtered with a 0.45-j.m filter. The filtered supernatants were centrifuged at 9000 rpm overnight at 4°C, and the released virus
was kept on ice for | hour. This step concentrated the supernatants from 220
mL to | to 2 mL. The transduction of human skin-derived cultured MCs (1
10°) was conducted by resuspending the cells in 100 j1L of concentrated viral
supernatants. Three days after infection, the medium was changed to virusfree IMDM containing rhSCF (100 ng/mL), rhIL-6 (50 ng/mL), and BSA
(0.1%) with puromycin (2 j.g/mL). Seven days after antibiotic selection, the
virus-infected human skin-derived cultured MCs were used for the
experiments.

Measurement of intracellular Ca?* levels

MrgX2 and vector alone-transfected CHO cells were incubated at 37°C for
1 hour in HEPES-buffered HBSS (pH 7.4) containing 2.5 mmol/L probenecid
and 4 wmol/L Fluo-3AM (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan). Next, the cells were

J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL
SEPTEMBER 2014

washed 4 times with the solution without Fluo-3AM. Intracellular Ca** concentrations were measured with the fluorometric imaging plate reader system
FLIPR (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif) both before and after SP, MBP,
EPO, EDN, or calcium ionophore A23187 was added.

Effect of drugs used for treatment,
neurotransmitters, and cytokines on MrgX2

expression levels on human skin MCs

Human skin MCs were incubated with the histamine HI receptor
antagonist olopatadine hydrochloride (10 jzmol/L; Tocris Bioscience, Bristol,
United Kingdom), the histamine H2 receptor antagonist famotidine (10 mol/
L; LKT Laboratories, St Paul, Minn), dexamethasone (10 mol/L; Cayman,
Ann Arbor, Mich), histamine dihydrochloride (10 mol/L; Acros Organics,
Geel, Belgium), SP (3 mol/L), rhIL-33 (30 ng/mL; PeproTech), rhTSLP (10
ng/mL; PeproTech), or both rhIL-33 (30 ng/mL) and rhTSLP (10 ng/mL) for
24 hours before flow cytometric analysis of MrgX2 expression levels on
human skin MCs. The concentrations and incubation times for the drugs,
neurotransmitters, and cytokines were determined based on previous

reports." !!

Histamine assay and de novo PGD,j synthesis assay

Histamine release and de novo PGD; synthesis from MCs were measured
with a Histamine EIA kit (Immunotech, MBL, Nagano, Japan) and a Prostaglandin D)-MOX EIA kit (Cayman).
