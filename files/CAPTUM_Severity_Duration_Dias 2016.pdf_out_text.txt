Abstract: BAcKGRounp: Chronic urticaria is a debilitating disease that considerably affects health-related quality of life, and the
Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire is the only questionnaire specifically designed for its evaluation.

Osjective: To evaluate the quality of life of patients with chronic urticaria, using the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire.

Metuops: The Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire was self-administered in 112 chronic urticaria patients and
disease activity was assessed through the Urticaria Activity Score. Clinical and socio-demographic characteristics of patients
were studied, such as: age, sex, etiologic diagnosis of chronic urticaria, duration of disease and Urticaria Activity Score.
Resutts: The population studied was composed 85.72% of women with a mean age of 46 years (18-90), while the median disease duration period was 10 years (3 months-60 years). Regarding the etiologic diagnosis, 48.22% had chronic spontaneous
urticaria; 22.32% associated with inducible urticaria, 28.57% with chronic autoimmune urticaria, and 23.21% had physical urticaria alone. Disease activity evaluated using the Urticaria Activity Score was 1.04 + 1.61 (0-6). The total score for the Chronic
Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire was 36 (0-100) and dimension I (sleep/mental status/eating) had a greater impact on
quality of life. The items with the highest mean scores were nervousness and shame over lesions, while the items with the
lowest scores were lip swelling and limitations on sporting activities.

Conc.usions: Chronic urticaria compromises patients’ quality of life, mainly those with more severe disease or who are diagnosed with chronic autoimmune urticaria.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a debilitating allergic skin disease, Hence, it is a subjective evaluation from the patient regarding the

which affects 0.5 to 1% of the population and is characterized by
erythematous, papulous and ichty lesions of a fluctuating nature
that persist for over six weeks.' It is highly complex in relation to its
etiology and treatment is challenging, even for experts.

Quality of life (QoL) has become an important subject for
society and especially for health professionals. It can be defined as
the individual satisfaction or happiness with life in domains that the
subject considers important. Several factors may affect a subject's
well-being, such as work, housing and financial concerns. Health
is but one of these factors. The expression “health-related quality of
life” (HRQoL) was thus developed to refer to the disease’s impact
on and therapy in a patient's life, according to his/her perception.

impact of health status on his/her full ability of living.*

In recent decades, the incorporation of patients’ perceptions
into decision-making over the handling of diseases has been an essential factor in improving the QoL of health assistance models. The
incapacity of traditional clinical parameters to express what people
feel and think has led to increased interest in the HRQoL field from
the scientific community.*

CU interferes with subjective well-being and daily life;
some patients* health status is comparable to that of coronary artery
disease and severe asthma patients. It also causes inconvenience in
family structures, compromising performance at work, school, and
negatively impacting on leisure activities.”

Impact of chronic urticaria on the quality of life of patients followed up at a university hospital 755

Skin pruritus causes variable discomfort, as well as lesions,
which, depending on their number and location, may harm an individual’s physical appearance and social life.®

Sleep disorders such as insomnia, fatigue and drowsiness due to pruritus or side effects from antihistamines - are frequently
observed. Patients complain of recurrent pain syndromes, including tension headaches and fibromyalgia, while the prevalence of
psychiatric disorders, like depression, hysteria, hypochondria and
post-traumatic stress disorder is high.”

The degree to which quality of life is affected varies according to the chronic urticaria’s etiology and severity. When CU is associated with delayed pressure urticaria, it affects quality of life more
significantly than urticaria alone.*

HRQoL evaluation of patients with CU is essential for a

better assessment of disease progression and treatment response. In
2005, Baiardini et al. developed and validated a specific questionnaire to evaluate the HRQoL in CU: the Chronic Urticaria Quality
of Life Questionnaire (CU-Q,oL), which has been shown to, have
satisfactory psychometric properties.” The CU-Q,oL, originally
written in Italian, was already successfully validated in Spanish,
German, Polish, Turkish, Brazilian Portuguese, Korean, Greek and
Persian."
This study sought to evaluate the HRQoL in CU patients
followed up at the outpatient chronic urticaria clinic of Hospital Universitdrio Clementino Fraga Filho (HUCFF) - Universidade Federal do
Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), who have participated in the transcultural validation process of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the CU-Q,oL,
recently adapted and validated by our group”.

METHODS

This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the same
patient’s sample evaluated in the Brazilian Portuguese cross-cultural adaptation of the CU-Q,oL study, published in 2011'°. The
study population comprised both male and female patients aged
over 18, clinically diagnosed with chronic urticaria, characterized
by the ocurrence of erythematous, papulous, pruriginous lesions,
for a period of over six weeks, screened from July 2009 to August
2010 at the HUCFF urticaria outpatient clinic. The study excluded
patients diagnosed with acute urticaria, contact urticaria, urticarial
vasculitis, angioedema with no urticaria, patients unable to understand study terms and to give written consent, and patients with
associated psychiatric comorbidities - 156 patients were evaluated
and 44 were excluded. The study was approved by the Hospital Ethics Committee, and all patients provided written informed consent
to participate.

The Brazilian version of CU-Q,oL includes 23 items that are
divided into three dimensions: sleep/mental status/eating, pruritus/ impact in daily activities, and limitations/appearance/edema.””

The questionnaire refers to the preceding two weeks,
and the patients indicate the intensity of each item separately, on
a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 = “not at all” to 5 = “very
much”. A score is calculated for each dimension, then a total index
is calculated for all the dimensions. The score ranges from 0 to 100.
The higher the score, the worse the patient’s perception of his/her
quality of life is.

Urticaria severity was evaluated using the score proposed
by Zurberbier et al. (2001); and disease severity was assessed via the
UAS - Urticaria Activity Score. The score evaluates the number of
lesions and pruritus intensity. The sum of scores obtained by evaluating urticaria and pruritus ranges from 0 to 6, where 0 corresponds
to controlled disease, while 6 corresponds to high intensity disease.”

The following clinical and socio-demographic characteristics of the patients were studied, such as: age (18-40 years, 4160 years, > 60 years), sex, etiologic diagnosis of chronic urticaria
(chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic autoimmune urticaria and
inducible urticaria), time to disease progression (< and > 5 years)
and UAS (group 1: scores 0 and 1; group 2: scores 2, 3 and 4; group
3: scores 5 and 6). Moreover, the ANOVA analysis was used to evaluate the differences between the groups.

Statistical analysis was performed through SPSS 17.0 and
Stata 8.0. A descriptive statistical analysis was used in the clinical
and demographic characterization of the patients studied, and an
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to compare three or four
independent means - p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

This study and the respective informed consent form were

approved by the Hospital Ethics Committee.

RESULTS

The population studied consisted of 96 female patients
(85.72%) and 16 male patients (14,28%), with a mean age of 46 years
(18-90) and a mean family income of R$1,828.66. In this sample,
58.03% of patients were married, 37.5% had not completed elementary school, and 8.03% had completed higher education, 49.11%
were employed, 27.68% were homemakers, and 13.40% were retired
(Table 1).

The mean time to disease progression was 10 years (3
months - 60 years), and the follow-up time at hospital was 4 years.
Regarding the etiologic diagnosis, 48.21% of patients had chronic
spontaneous urticaria (CSU), 22.32% associated with physical urticaria, 28.57% had chronic autoimmune urticaria (CAU) and 23.21%
had inducible urticaria alone. Furthermore, 59.82% of patients required continuous treatment with antihistamines (Table 2).

Disease activity evaluated by UAS score was 1.04 + 1.61 (06). Of the 112 patients enrolled in the study, 8 (7%) did not answer
at least one question from the CU-Q,oL. The item with the highest ratio of blank answers was item 4 (lip swelling). The mean total
score for the questionnaire was 36, while dimension I had the highest score; however, the score values were homogeneous for all three
dimensions (Table 3).

The items with the highest mean scores were 15 (nervousness), followed by 18 (shame over lesions) and 1 (pruritus). The lowest scores were item 4 (lip swelling) and 22 (limtations on sporting
activity) (Table 4).

Seventy-five percent of the patients were not doing sporting
activities and only 16% indicated chronic urticaria as the reason for this.
Of the 28 patients who played sports, 42.8% mentioned that urticaria
interfered a little, somewhat, or too much in sporting activity-related
quality of life. Of the 13 patients who were not practicing sports due
to urticaria, 69% reported that urticaria affected much or very much.

ANOVA analysis showed that patients aged 41-60 years were

patients with autoimmune urticaria were more impacted in dimension III, compared with patients suffering from chronic spontaneous
urticaria and inducible urticaria alone. Women were more affected in
all dimensions but not in a statistically significant manner. Patients
with higher severity scores (group 3) experienced a greater impact on
quality of life in the total score, and in dimensions II and III (Table 5).

DISCUSSION

CU seriously compromises the HRQoL of patients due to
debilitating and uncomfortable symptoms that may last for years.°

In addition to classic symptoms, like pruritus and papules,
other factors are more relevant for patients with chronic urticaria,
such as unpredictability of flares, sleep disorders, fatigue, drug-related side effects, and physical appearance. Thus, merely evaluating
urticaria progress by counting lesions and measuring pruritus intensity is insufficient. A holistic evaluation of the patient is required
for a better understanding of disease impact. In 2010, the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA,LEN) study group recommended evaluating the Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) and
HRQoL in clinical trials on allergy, recognizing the importance of
better knowledge of subjective evaluation of patients in relation to
health status factors."

Most studies on quality of life concerning chronic urticaria
have used generic questionnaires or those for dermatological diseases, such as the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index), which
was validated as a useful instrument to evaluate the HRQoL of patients with chronic urticaria.” However, the DLQI can be used for
any dermatological disease, since it was not developed specifically
chronic urticaria patients and may not measure important factors

concerning them. CU-Q,oL is a valid and specific instrument to

concerning them. CU-Q,oL is a valid and specific instrument to
evaluate the HRQOL. It is easily applied and requires five minutes
to be completed by the patient.’ This study aimed to evaluate the
impact of chronic urticaria on the quality of life of patients followed
up ata university outclinic, to determine which aspects of quality of
life affected these patients the most.

The population evaluated in this study showed a high prevalence of chronic urticaria in women (85.72%). Epidemiological
studies demonstrate that occurrence is twice as high in female patients. A population investigation conducted in Germany demonstrated that in a sample of 4,093 people, 1.8% had CU, of which
70.3% were women, while the sample from the CU-Q,oL original
study included 61.84%." It is frequently noted that women are
more affected by chronic urticaria and other autoimmune diseases.

In most studies, the peak age of CU occurrence is between
20 and 40 years.® Thus, patients are mainly affected during their
working life years and are more prone to absenteeism and decreased
productivity because of illness and its treatment. A Spanish study
observed that the mean age of patients was 35.75+18.9 years and this
study population had a mean age of 46 years (18-70 years).”°

Patients had a high educational level compared with the
overall population, with 45% having at least completed high school,
similarly to the findings of the original study (51.31%)."° The average income was R$1,828.66, while the average income of Brazilian
families in 2010 was R$1,292.00.”” Many diseases have a prevalence
standard, which is dependent on socio-economic and educational
levels. With respect to urticaria, there is little data available on this
issue. Several studies were not able to show a difference in the prevalence of urticaria in terms of educational level, occupation, income,
residence location, and ethnic origin.

The mean time to disease progression was 10.6 years (3
months-60 years). In the Baiardini et al. study, the time was shorter,
around 1 year and 9 months (SD: 27.32 months)."° Gaig et al. found

that 50% of CU patients were asymptomatic in three months, and
80% in 12 months. However, 11% were affected for over five years.*
In most cases, chronic urticaria typically remits after 1-5 years,
though 10-20% of cases may last 5-10 years and some can persist
for up to 50 years. Patients with severe urticaria at diagnosis usually experience longer durations. In our population, 61% of patients
presented the disease for over five years. The authors believe that
the high frequency of long-lasting cases in these series is due to the
institution being a reference center, which tends to recruit severe
and refractory cases.

Regarding the etiology of chronic urticaria, just like in the
medical literature, a higher prevalence of CSU (48.21%) was observed, followed by CAU (28.56%), and physical urticaria alone
(23.21%).' Nevertheless, when all patients with inducible urticaria
(alone and associated) were considered, a prevalence of 66.95% was
found. In the Spanish study, patients experienced chronic spontaneous urticaria in 68% of cases, and physical urticaria in 60%."
About half of the study population did not have an etiologic diagnosis despite having undergone a complete research protocol with
challenge tests for physical urticaria and an autologous serum test.
Affected patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria suffer deep
frustration because of the uncertainty about the cause of their disease, which reduces their quality of life.

The first application of the Brazilian Portuguese version
of CU-Q2oL showed that it is a useful tool to evaluate the disease
more specifically.

The dimension score was not elevated, ranging from 34.4 to
39.9 ona scale of 0 to 100. This is because the study population was
very heterogeneous, encompassing patients with different types of
urticaria at various stages of disease progression. The mean UAS
score was low (1.04 + 1.61 [0-6]), as 66 patients (58%) were asymptomatic on evaluation day.

Dimension I (sleep/mental state/eating) revealed a greater

An Bras Dermatol. 2016;91(6):754-9

the disease entails sleep disorders, causing significant damage to
mental health, as well as chronic fatigue, loss of professional productivity and commitment to their personal and social lives. Previous studies have reported that chronic urticaria has a significant impact on quality of life, especially as regards sleep and energy, which
is consistent with our results.4”

Question 15, “nervousness”, had the highest score (55).
This finding confirms the high impact of chronic urticaria on the
patients’ mental health. Pasaoglu et al. demonstrated that patients
with chronic spontaneous urticaria had a higher prevalence of depression, hysteria, hypochondria, and conflicts with their social environment.

The questions “embarrassed by signs” and “pruritus” also
revealed a great impact on quality of life, as the first question assesses patients feelings and the second, the main and most troublesome
symptom of this disease, which interferes with daily activities and
mental health.

The question on “lip swelling” had the lowest score, like in
the Spanish study." Sporting activities were not regarded as relevant by the patients either, probably because 75% of the patients involved in this study were not practicing sports and urticaria was the
reason for only 13% of them. The precursor O’Donnel study showed
that 45% of CU patients reported limitations for running.*

Regarding gender, women were expected to be more affected than men.”*! Women likely have more sensitive skin and mental
awareness toward the symptoms of hives and are more influenced
by changes in appearance. In fact, a greater impact was found in all
dimensions for women, though there was no statistical significance.

In relation to age, patients aged between 41 and 60 years
had a higher impact in dimension I. This age group includes adults
at the peak of their professional lives, and disturbances in sleep and
mental state limit their working lives.

Variance analysis of CU-Q,oL results showed that patients
with autoimmune urticaria (CAU) had the worst quality of life in
dimension III (edema, appearance, and limitations). Several studies
evaluating disease severity have concluded that patients with
positive autologous serum skin tests were more affected than those

with negative tests.” A multicenter study published in 2009 revealed

An Bras Dermatol. 2016;91(6):754-9

the highest disease severity and worst quality of life measured by
DLAI in patients with positive autologous serum skin tests.”

Severity assessment (UAS) demonstrated a strong correlation with the quality of life impact. Patients with more severe disease showed greater degree of impairment, especially in dimension
II (itching/impact on daily activities).

In Brazil, there are few studies evaluating HRQoL in patients with chronic urticaria. However, it was shown that these
patients underwent an important change in QoL; the most affected
domains were food restrictions, emotional changes and quality of
sleep.* A study published in 2011 using DLQI and SF-36, a generic
instrument to evaluate quality of life, demonstrated greater impairment in: women, patients aged up to 30, those experiencing their
first visit, patients with a high level of education, those who had
the disease for up to 1 year, and angioedema patients.” In another
Brazilian study published in 2011, the patients had a mean score of
13.5 in the DLQI (0-30), the presence of angioedema was associated with higher scores (14.3; p < 0.01); women were more limited
with respect to clothing and men with respect to work and study
(p < 0.05).™ In these studies, the presence of angioedema and being female were associated with a worse quality of life. This study
highlights a tendency toward a worse quality of life in women. The
difference between patients with and without angioedema was not
assessed. There is a need for further studies to define the predictive
factors that affect quality of life in the Brazilian population.

CONCLUSION

Chronic urticaria seriously compromises the quality of life
of patients due to its debilitating symptoms that can last for years.
In this study, a major impairment was observed in patients with the
highest severity and in those diagnosed with autoimmune urticaria. An evaluation of quality of life is fundamental to better assess
disease progression and treatment efficacy, as per recommended by
the GA,LEN. In the future, the Brazilian Portuguese version of the
CU-Q,oL may enable multicenter studies to be performed, in addition to promoting an overall understanding of the impact of chronic
urticaria.
