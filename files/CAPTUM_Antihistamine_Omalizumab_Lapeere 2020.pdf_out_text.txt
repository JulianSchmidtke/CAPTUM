Abstract

Background Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is characterized by the repeated occurrence of persistent
hives and/or angioedema for >6 weeks, without specific external stimuli. H,-antihistamines have long been the
standard of care of CSU, but many patients remain uncontrolled even at 4x the approved dose. Add-on therapy with omalizumab has proven effective in clinical trials, but little is known about omalizumab treatment in
Belgium.

Objective To collect real-world clinical data on omalizumab treatment in adults with CSU in Belgium.

Methods This was an observational, retrospective chart review of adults with CSU, who initiated omalizumab treatment
between August 2014 and December 2016 (maximum 28 months follow-up).

Results In total, 235 patients were included (median time from symptom onset to diagnosis, 5.4 months; median time from diagnosis to commencing omalizumab, 6.7 months). Treatments used before/after commencing
omalizumab did not always adhere to guidelines; many patients (26.4%/11.1%) received first-generation H,-antihistamines, while 20.4% used omalizumab monotherapy after initiating treatment. The mean interval between
omalizumab administrations was 4.8 (SD 1.7) weeks; 67.8% of patients had >1 interval prolongation and/or
shortening. Mean baseline 7-day Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) was 32.0 (SD 6.05); this improved to 12.6 (SD
11.2) after 1 month of omalizumab. About 67.2% of patients reached UAS7 <6 (well controlled) during the
study. A total of 87 patients stopped omalizumab and never restarted before the end of the observation period;
the most prevalent reason was remission of symptoms (49.4% of patients), followed by lack of effect (12.6%),
lost to follow-up (6.9%) and adverse events (3.4%). Headache was the most common adverse event (n = 8/82).
No anaphylaxis was reported.

Conclusions This study revealed that patients initiated on omalizumab in Belgium had severe CSU at baseline, and
showed substantial improvements after 1 month of treatment. Greater adherence to the prescription of guideline-recommended medications is needed for the treatment of CSU.

Introduction

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common skin disorder characterized
by the repeated occurrence of hives and/or angioedema for more
than 6 weeks.’ CU is divided into two types: chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), in which symptoms occur in the absence
of specific external triggers, and chronic inducible urticaria
(CIndU), in which symptoms occur in response to specific stimuli, such as exposure to cold, heat or pressure.’

Previous reports suggest that many patients are undertreated
and not receiving the recommended therapy.*~> CSU can be debilitating and unpredictable, and has a significant negative impact on
quality of life (QoL);* it can result in work productivity loss and
absenteeism,’ interference with sleep and daily activities,’ and high
levels of anxiety and psychological distress.” Thus, the EAACI/
GA*LEN/EDF/WAO guidelines recommended treatment using a
specific algorithm that allows for stepping up or down of medications until achieving complete symptom control."

For many years, H,-antihistamines have been recommended
as the standard of care in CSU,'*"'° but up to 60% of patients
remain uncontrolled at the licensed dose.'! For these patients,
the guidelines recommend uptitrating H,-antihistamines up to
four times the licensed dose, followed by add-on therapy with
omalizumab.' Omalizumab is very effective in the treatment of
CSU; it reduces the numbers of urticarial weals and pruritus,
prevents angioedema, improves QoL and has a favourable safety
profile.'?-!? Ciclosporin A, also off label for urticaria, is only recommended for patients with severe disease refractory to the
combination of antihistamines and omalizumab.

A systematic review of 84 observational studies indicated that
findings from clinical trials underscore the real-world effectiveness of omalizumab in the management of CSU;?° however,
there was no data for Belgium in the systematic review, and there
is little published information on the use of omalizumab in daily
clinical practice in this country. This study was designed to
describe omalizumab treatment patterns since becoming available in Belgium for CSU to better understand omalizumab dosing, treatment outcomes, patients’ characteristics and healthcare
burden in the real-world setting.

in Belgium, where omalizumab is known to be used to treat
patients with CSU. Omalizumab was funded via a medical
need program from August 2014 based on a diagnosis of
CSU for >6 months and 7-day urticaria activity
(UAS7)>16 and via the public healthcare system from 1 June
2015 onwards based on a diagnosis of CSU for >6 months
and UAS7 > 28. Funding of omalizumab treatment via the
medical need program or national reimbursement was not

score

mandatory for inclusion.

The data for this study were retrieved retrospectively from
patients’ medical records at the participating dermatology and
internal medicine centres. The study was designed, implemented
and reported in accordance with the Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practices of the International Society for
Pharmacoepidemiology,”! and the STROBE guidelines.”

Patients

Patients (=18 years old) were included who had a diagnosis of
CSU and had received >1 treatment with omalizumab and >1
follow-up visit between August 2014 and December 2016.
Patients were excluded if they participated in any randomized
trial in CU during the observation period or if they were treated
with omalizumab for any off-label indication.

Demographics and baseline characteristics

Demographic data collected included age and gender. Baseline
characteristics included date of CSU symptom onset and diagnosis; severity of CSU disease by means of Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI; range 0-30) and UAS7 (range 0-42);7? CSU
relevant medical history; and work/school attendance. UAS7
scores/ranges are defined as: urticaria-free (0); well-controlled
(1-6); mild (7-15); moderate (16-27); and severe (28—42).°4
Change in UAS7 after starting omalizumab was determined.

Omalizumab treatment exposure and outcome
Omalizumab dosing, frequency of administration, duration and
treatment intervals, as well as reasons for treatment delay or
interruption were analysed. Treatments used before commencing and in combination with omalizumab were examined.

CSU-related healthcare resource use

The number and nature of urticaria tests, the number of CSUrelated emergency room admissions and length of stay, patient
referrals and the number of CSU consultations were analysed.

Results

Patient characteristics

In total, 235 patients were included in this chart review, the
majority of whom were female (67.7%), and the mean age
was 46.2 years (Table 1). The mean observation period was
15.7 (SD 7.8) months. Of these, 70.2% of patients were treated in university hospitals (39.6% dermatology; 30.6% internal medicine), 9.8% in peripheral hospitals (all dermatology)
and 20.0% in private dermatology practices. Patients treated
in private practices had a mean of 11.9 CSU-related consultations compared with 9.2 and 8.6 for university hospital dermatology and internal medicine specialties, respectively, and
8.7 for peripheral hospitals. Patients were mainly referred by
their general practitioner (n = 98; 41.7%) or by other dermatologists (n = 58; 24.7%).

In the total population, 27 patients (11.5%) did not attend
school or work for a mean duration of 1.2 (SD 5.3) days per
month because of CSU-related problems before omalizumab
treatment. In contrast, 16 patients (6.8%) did not attend school
or work for mean duration of 0.5 (SD 3.3) days per month since
omalizumab initiation. Before omalizumab treatment, 13 (5.5%
of total population) patients had a prior CSU-related emergency
room admission for angioedema (n = 6), rash (n = 5), anxiety
(n = 2) and infection (n = 1); one patient was admitted for two

reasons. During the observation period, two patients had a CSUrelated emergency room admission while on omalizumab, one
for angioedema and one for rash.

It should be noted that although omalizumab reimbursement
became available during the course of this study (June 2015), the
median time from symptom onset to omalizumab start was similar between those who were enrolled before and after reimbursement (Table 1); the median time from CSU diagnosis to
omalizumab start was shorter for those enrolled after reimbursement (5.5 months) compared with those enrolled before (9.1
months). It should also be noted that 81 patients received omalizumab funding via the Medical Need Program, 208 received
national reimbursement (71 of whom were previously funded
via the Medical Need program), eight patients had their treat
 

ment paid for by other funding, and 19 patients

ad no funding

The mean number of diagnostic tests per patient was 2.7, the
most common of which were differential blood count in 75.3%
of patients (n = 177/235), immunoglobulin (Ig) E levels in
41.3% (n = 97/235) and ClIndU provocations tests in 29.4%
(n = 69/235); 13.6% of patients had no diagnostic test for CU
(Fig. 1). The mean IgE level was 257.7 IU/mL, with a large distribution (range 2.0-2914.0 IU/mL, median 106.0 IU/mL).
Angioedema was reported in 40.6% of patients and 49.3% suffered from comorbid CIndU, of which symptomatic dermographism was the most common (31.0%); all other ClndUs
occurred in less than 10% of patients. Other comorbidities of
interest included atopy (14.0% of patients) and allergic asthma
(7.4%).

Treatment patterns before and after commencing
omalizumab
Before commencing omalizumab, 87.7% of patients received
second-generation H,-antihistamines (Table 2); of these, 42.7%
(n = 88/206) were receiving them at the approved dose, while
15.5% (n = 32/206), 6.3% (n = 13/206) and 35.4% (n = 73/
206) were updosed to 2x, 3x and 4x the approved dose,
respectively. Of the 26.4% of patients who received first-generation H,-antihistamines before commencing omalizumab, 87.1%
(n = 54/62) received them at the approved dose, while 8.1%
(n = 5/62), 1.6% (n = 1/62) and 3.2% (n = 2/62) were updosed
to 2x, 3x and 4x the approved dose, respectively. In total,
95.3% (n = 224/235) of patients received a first- or second-generation H,-antihistamine before omalizumab.

After initiating omalizumab, 74.5% of patients received concomitant second-generation H,-antihistamines at least once; of

JEADV 2020, 34, 127-134

these, 65.7% (n = 115/175) received them at the approved dose,
40.0% (n = 70/175) were updosed to 4x the approved dose. Of
the 11.1% of patients who received first-generation H,-antihistamines after commencing omalizumab, 84.6% (n = 22/26)
were receiving them at the approved dose, while 11.5% (n = 3/
26) were updosed to 2-4x the approved dose. One-hundredseventy-nine patients (76.2%) received first- or second-generation H,-antihistamines in combination with omalizumab.
Patients received first- or second-generation H,-antihistamines
in combination with omalizumab for 48.9% and 74.9% of the
time while on omalizumab, respectively. Before omalizumab
treatment, corticosteroids were used by 42.6% (n = 100/235) of
patients at least once, while 13.6% (n = 32/235) used them in
combination after commencing omalizumab.

Before commencing omalizumab, 31.1% (n = 73/235) of
patients were treated with monotherapy, 32.2% (n = 76/235)
with dual therapy and 20.0% (n = 47/235) with triple therapy.
After commencing omalizumab, it was used as monotherapy in
20.4% (n = 48/235) of patients, 34.4% (n = 81/235) of patients
had one other CSU medication in combination (dual therapy),
and 27.7% (n = 65/235) had two CSU medications added (triple
therapy) as the maximum number of CSU treatments combined
during the observation period.

The mean duration of omalizumab treatment within the
observation period was 11.9 (SD 7.6) months; 54.0% of patients
were treated for 1 year; 20.4% were treated for 1.5 years; and the
remaining 25.5% were treated more than 1.5 years. The majority
of patients (93.6%) received omalizumab 300 mg; however,
4.3% (n = 10/235) received 450 mg, 0.9% (n = 2/235) 600 mg,
13.2% (n = 31/235) 150 mg and 0.4% (n = 1/235) 75 mg at
least once during the observation period. Most patients (84.3%)
had no dose change during the omalizumab treatment period.

The mean interval between omalizumab administrations was
4.8 weeks; 32.2% of patients received omalizumab at a consistent 4-week interval. At least once during the observation period,
61.7% had a prolonged (>5 weeks) treatment interval, while
19.6% had a shortened (<3 weeks) interval; some patients

(13.5%) had both a prolongation and shortening. In total,
10.6% of patients had >1 treatment interruption. Practical reasons were the most common cause of treatment interval prolongation (56.1%) or treatment interval shortening (57.5%). Other
reasons for interval prolongation were temporary interruption

of treatment (18.2%), tapering (40.2%) and other reasons
(3.8%). Other reasons for interval shortening were lack of efficacy (32.5%). In most patients, the 4-week interval was at least
once prolonged/shortened, but in general by pooling all interval
data only 15.4% were prolonged and 3.2% shortened.

For the 43 patients who stopped omalizumab treatment and
did not restart during the observation period for remission of
symptoms, nine patients (20.9%) were treated with omalizumab
for less than 6 months and 34 patients (79.1%) were treated
longer than 6 months. The interval between treatment stop and
the end of the observation period was <1 month for 14 of these
patients (32.6%), 1-2 months for nine patients (20.9%), 2—
3 months for one patient (2.3%) and longer than 3 months for
19 patients (44.2%).

Evolution of UAS7 score

The mean baseline UAS7 was 32.0 (SD 6.1); this improved to
12.6 (SD 11.2) after one month of omalizumab treatment
(Fig. 2a). The number of patients for whom a UAS7 score was
reported differs per month; 15.3% had no UAS score available
during the observation period. During the observation period,
67.2% (n = 158/235) of patients reached UAS7 < 6 (well controlled; Fig. 2b); 9.8%, 3.8% and 3.8% reached UAS7 of 7-15,
16-27 and 28-42, respectively; five patients (2.5%) remained at
UAS7 > 28 during the omalizumab treatment period. During
the observation period, 42.6% of patients (n = 106/235) became
urticaria-free (UAS7 = 0) after a mean of 4.0 + 4.6 months
treatment with omalizumab. The 52 patients who reached a
minimum UAS7 < 6, but not 0, needed a mean of 6.8 (SD 6.1)
months treatment with omalizumab to achieve a well-controlled
state (Fig. 3).

Work/school absenteeism before and after commencing
omalizumab

In total, 27 patients (11.5%) reported an absenteeism from work
or school before omalizumab treatment, with an average of
1.2 days absent per month. After commencing omalizumab, 16
patients (6.8%) reported an absenteeism, with an average of
0.5 days per month.

Adverse events

In total, 82 adverse events (AEs) were reported (0.35 AEs per
patient) in 52 patients (22.1% of the total population) during
the observation period. Of these, 29 AEs in 26 patients were possibly related to omalizumab (Table 3). Six severe AEs (SAEs;
7.3%) were reported in five patients (2.1%). Of these SAEs, one
case of headache and one combined case of flu, nausea, dizziness, fatigue and constipation were possibly related to omalizumab; while one case of arthralgia with hospitalization, one
case of extreme somnolence (not significant), one case of urticaria worsening with hospitalization and one case of stress (not
significant) had unknown association with omalizumab. There
were no reports of anaphylaxis. Causality was unknown for 31
cases in 21 patients.

Discussion

This patient chart review provides good insight into omalizumab
treatment in Belgium, with a large patient cohort and more than
2 years of data. The findings revealed that patients initiated on
omalizumab in Belgium had severe CSU at baseline (mean
UAS7 = 32.0), and most had been treated with H,-antihistamines for a relative long time prior to starting omalizumab. Patient
demographics and clinical characteristics in this study are representative of the general population of patients with CSU.° The
difficult journey to diagnosis and treatment of patients with
CSU was confirmed by the long periods of time between symptom onset to diagnosis, and from diagnosis to omalizumab

was shortened by 3.6-5.5 months; however, better care is still
needed to shorten the long period from symptom onset to diagnosis.

H,-antihistamines, which are minimally or non-sedating and
free of anticholinergic effects, should be prescribed as standard
of care.! However, the data in this study are in contrast to these
guidelines, since H,-antihistamines were updosed to 4x the
approved dose in only 35.4% of patients; however, this could be
associated with the requirement of patients to only be resistant
to H,-antihistamines at the approved dose for reimbursement in
Belgium. Corticosteroid use was also high both before and after
initiation of omalizumab. Recent evidence has shown that shortterm use of corticosteroids is associated with a 2- to 5-fold
increase in the incidence of acute adverse events, including sepsis, venous thromboembolism and fracture, compared with
background rates.*>**

Montelukast and ciclosporin were both used as add-on therapies before and after commencing omalizumab. Both of these
treatments were previously recommended as third-line add-on
therapies to H,-antihistamines during this study; however, montelukast is no longer recommended owing to the poor level of
evidence for its efficacy, and ciclosporin is only recommended as
standard therapy owing to not being licensed and its inferior
safety profile compared with omalizumab.’ It should be noted
that the previous guidelines were the relevant guidelines during
this study, which accounts for the relatively high use of montelukast (40.9%) and ciclosporin (16.6%) prior to initiating
omalizumab.* In the updated guidelines, ciclosporin is recommended to only be prescribed for patients with severe disease
that is refractory to combined treatment with H,-antihistamines
(at any dose) and omalizumab.'

The updated guidelines provide strong recommendation for
the use of omalizumab as third-line therapy in patients who are
unresponsive to high doses of H,-antihistamines.' This

recommendation is based on numerous studies confirming the
effectiveness of omalizumab in the treatment of CSU and its
favourable safety profile.'*-!° Indeed, the results of this chart
review support this recommendation, through the rapid and
substantial decrease in disease activity from severe at baseline
(mean UAS7 = 32.0) to mild after one month of omalizumab
(mean UAS7 = 12.6). These benefits continued to improve with
time, with the lowest mean UAS7 of 3.5 (i.e. well-controlled
urticaria) after 28 months of omalizumab treatment. Although
the data are limited, improvements were noted in work/school
absenteeism and CSU-related ER admissions following omalizumab treatment initiation. These findings support the need for
earlier diagnosis and treatment initiation in CSU, with a further
need for escalation of treatment to add-on omalizumab in
patients who are inadequately treated with H,-antihistamines.
Recent studies suggest that dose interval adjustments may
benefit some patients who respond early or late to omalizumab,
requiring longer or shorter intervals between administrations,
respectively.*°** As reimbursement of omalizumab in Belgium
is only for a 4-week dosing regimen, there is very little flexibility
with treatment intervals. Still, in this study, many patients had a
prolongation (=5 weeks) or shortening (<3 weeks) of a treatment interval, with ‘practical reason’ being the most common
reason for prolongation, and ‘lack of efficacy’ being the most
common for interval shortening. The reported rate of discontin
 

uations for remission of symptoms was high, but as only 44.2%
of these patients were stopped for longer than 3 months, so
these data should be interpreted with caution.

Potential limitations of the present study are its non-interventional character, and the likelihood of missing data and patients

 

lost to follow-up due to the long observation period. Indeed, few
patients had data available on the effect of CSU on QoL, so this
could not be assessed. However, non-interventional studies are
the preferred means of collecting real-world data, which provides meaningful insight into patient treatment in clinical practice. The findings of this study are not only useful for physicians
in Belgium, but for those worldwide who adhere to the EAACI/
GA?LEN/EDE/WAO guidelines.

This chart review revealed that patients initiated on omalizumab in Belgium had severe CSU at baseline, and showed substantial improvements after one month of treatment and
continued benefit for up to 28 months of treatment with omalizumab. Findings also identified a need for greater adherence to
the prescription of guideline-recommended medications before
starting and in combination with omalizumab in Belgium.
