Summary

Clinical and
Experimental
Allergy

Background Approximately 40% of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) subjects have
autoantibodies to either FceRIx or IgE. The effect of such autoantibodies on circulating
basophil activation status is unknown.

Objective The expression of cell surface activation markers on basophils from CIU, non
allergic, and allergic subjects were compared. Further, the relationship between marker
expression and serum factors reported in CIU, such as histamine-releasing activity (HRA) and
immunoreactivity to FeeRIx were examined.

Methods Peripheral blood was obtained from CIU, allergic, and non-allergic donors and
fractionated by density gradients. Enriched basophils (1-12%) were analysed by flow
cytometry for expression of activation markers including CD63, CD69, and CD203c. Dilutions
of serum (5-50%) were analysed for HRA on basophils from a normal donor. Serum was tested
for immunoreactivity by western blotting to a standard cell lysate prepared from an RBL
SX38 cell line transfected with human FceRI«.

Results CIU subjects (n=9) and allergic subjects (n=8) exhibited enhanced expression of
CD63 and CD69, as compared with non-allergic subjects (n = 7); however, no difference was
seen among groups for CD203c expression. Five CIU and two non-allergic subjects had
evidence of significant serum HRA (> 20%), whereas two CIU, two allergic, and three nonallergic subjects had evidence of serum immunoreactivity to FeeRIx. Serum HRA and serum

immunoreactivity to FeeRIx were not associated with enhanced surface marker expression.

Introduction

In the last decade several groups have forwarded the idea
that chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) may be the result
of autoimmunity [1]. Specifically, approximately 40% of
patients are reported to have serum autoantibodies of
which 90% are directed against the high affinity IgE
receptor alpha subunit (FceRIa) while 10% target IgE [1,
2]. Separately, it has been noted that another 40% of CIU
patients possess serum histamine releasing activity (HRA)
by in vitro testing using donor basophils [3]. Although it is
assumed that serum HRA and autoantibodies represent the
same entity, there is a significant discordance between the
presence of these two serum factors in CIU subjects [4, 5].
Although it has been suggested that subjects with auto
antibodies have more severe disease [5], the presence of
serum HRA did not significantly modify the leucocyte
infiltrates present in biopsies of either new (<4h) or more
established (> 12h) lesions [6].

In recent years, a role for basophils has emerged in CIU
[7]. Basophils are present in the leucocyte infiltrate in skin
biopsies of CIU lesions, which resemble the cellular
infiltrate found in late-phase allergen injection sites [8].
Likewise, reduced circulating basophil numbers have been
correlated with heightened CIU disease activity [9]. Additionally, basophils of CIU subjects have a selective
reduction in functional response to anti-IgE, but not to
other stimuli [10-12]. It has also been noted that the
functional defect via the IgE receptor resolves as CIU
remits [10]. Several groups recently have shown that cell
Basophil activation in chronic idiopathic urticaria 771

 

surface marker expression is useful to detect basophil
activation [13-15]. For example, CD63, a member of the
transmembrane-4 superfamily, is rapidly mobilized on the
basophil surface by IL-3, anti-IgE, and allergen, as well as
other degranulation stimuli [13, 16]. In contrast, CD69, is
slowly induced after basophil exposure to IL-3, and is
thought to require de novo synthesis. In vivo, CD69 is also
increased on basophils from the BAL of asthmatics [16].
Most recently, cell surface expression of CD203c (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase (E-NPP3)) has been shown to be
enhanced by anti-IgE and allergen [17-20]. Further, its
expression is unique to basophils, mast cells and their
progenitors [21]. Although these same basophil markers
have been applied as an in vitro measure to support the
clinical diagnosis of allergy, issues remain in regards to
their sensitivity and specificity relative to more traditional
tests such as skin tests, specific IgE levels measured by
RAST or basophil histamine release assays [15, 18, 22].

Although reported for over a decade, direct evidence
that circulating serum autoantibodies or HRA in CIU is
linked to altered basophil or mast cell function in vivo is
limited [23]. While recent studies have suggested the use
of CIU sera-induced CD63 expression on basophils of
normal donors as a potential screening tool for autoimmune urticaria [24-27], we are interested in directly
examining the in vivo levels of activation markers on the
basophils of CIU subjects. In the present study, we compared the in vivo expression of basophil activation markers among non-allergic, allergic, and CIU subjects to test
the hypothesis that basophil activation status would be
greatest in CIU subjects. In addition, we examined the
relationship between serum factors and the levels of these
basophil activation markers. Specifically, we measured
serum HRA, as well as immunoreactivity to FeeRIa.

 

 

Materials and methods

Study subjects

All study subjects were recruited from the Johns Hopkins
Asthma and Allergy Center, via postings. CIU subjects (n= 9,
1 M/8 F, mean age = 37.6 years) were characterized based on
allergist diagnosis as well as active status of disease. Allergic
subjects (n=8, 6 M/2 F, mean age=33.3 years) were
characterized based on positive skin test and a history of
allergic rhinitis or asthma. Non-allergic subjects (n= 7, 2 M/
5 F; mean age=40.7 years) were characterized based on
absence of the previously mentioned criteria. After informed
consent, subjects underwent venipuncture via a protocol
approved by the Western Institutional Review Board.

Basophil isolation

Venous blood samples were drawn into syringes containing
5 mm EDTA [26] to prevent coagulation. Blood mononuclear

cells were obtained by density-gradient sedimentation,
using Accuspin separation tubes (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) and a discontinuous double Percoll gradient, as
described [28]. Basophils (purity 1-12%) were enumerated
by Alcian Blue staining [29]. For serum histamine-releasing
assays, venous blood from non-CIU donors was subjected to
dextran sedimentation to obtain mixed leucocytes with
basophil purity <1% [30]. A separate serum tube was
collected from all donors for immunoblotting assays.

Dual colour flow cytometry

Enriched basophil suspensions were labelled for direct and
indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Antibodies used include: irrelevant mouse IgG1 control
(MOPC-21; BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA),
FITC-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-human IgE and its
control FITC-conjugated normal goat IgG (Kirkegaard and
Perry, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and PE anti-mouse IgG
(Biosource; Camarillo, CA, USA). PE-conjugated mouse
IgG1, mouse anti-CD63 IgG1 (CLB-gran12), mouse antiCD69 IgG2B (TP1.55.3), and PE-conjugated mouse antiCD203c IgG1 (97A6) were purchased from Immunotech
(Hialeah, FL, USA). In select subjects, platelet contamination of enriched basophil preparations was monitored by
the use of a mouse anti-CD42b IgG1 (SZ2), also from
Immunotech. Cells were incubated with monoclonal antibodies specific to each surface marker for 30 min at 4°C in
the presence of FITC-conjugated anti-human IgE. Cells
were then washed and, if necessary, labelled with PEconjugated anti-mouse for an additional 30 min. Samples
were analysed on a Berton Dickinson FACS Caliber flow
cytometer employing Cell Quest software. Cells were
initially gated based on FITC-IgE-positive cells to select
the basophil population and then analysed for specific
activation markers [31]. With rare exception, marker
expression was unimodal. Data are expressed as net
median fluorescence intensity (actual MFI — MFI of irrelevant IgG control). In pilot studies, basophils were also
labelled for flow cytometry using a whole blood lysis
approach [18] in parallel with Percoll isolation.

 

 

Serum histamine-releasing activity

In preliminary studies, eight normal basophil donors were
screened for high-range (upper quartile) release to antiIgE and CIU sera [24]. A single donor was selected, whose
basophils were then activated by dilutions of the subjects’
sera (50, 25, 5%) as well as a crosslinking anti-IgE as a
positive control. Histamine content was quantitated in
cell-free supernatants using an automated fluorometric
assay [32]. Results are shown as the percentage of total
histamine content present in a lysate of a leucocyte
aliquot after subtracting spontaneous release. In addition,
772 XK. Vasagar et al

 

sera was also tested with RBL-SX38 cells (transfected with
human FceRI«) as a separate measure of serum HRA that
may involve factors targeting unoccupied FceRIa.

Serum immunoreactivity for FceRIa

Diluted sera (1: 250) was used to immunoblot a standard
lysate of RBL-SX38 cells transfected with human FcsRla
as described [3, 28]. Cell lysates from a single passage of
RBL-SX38s were separated by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes
were next immunoblotted with each individual serum,
followed by use of a secondary anti-human IgG-HRP
(Amersham-Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ, USA). As a positive control, a single lane of each gel was immunoblotted
with a commercial antibody against FceRI« (polyclonal
rabbit anti-human FceRI« subunit, Upstate Biotechnology,
Lake Placid, NY, USA), followed by anti-rabbit IgG-HRP
(Amersham-Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ, USA) to allow for
comparisons of relative band intensity between gels (Fig.
1) [28]. Analysis of band density was conducted using the
Bio-Rad imaging system (Bin-Rad Laboratories, Segrate,
Italy). Using this software, a three-dimensional model of
each band was generated. The volume of each band was
calculated, and adjusted for local background. Positive
serum immunoreactivity was based on two criteria: an
adjusted volume greater than 1 U, as well as an adjusted
volume greater than 10% of the respective gel-positive
control.

Statistical design

The statistical analysis utilized STATVIEW 5 package for
Macintosh and Student’s ¢ test for normally distributed
data such as cell surface marker expression. A P-value of
less than 0.05 was considered to be significant.

Results

Activation marker expression

We first examined er vivo basophil activation marker
expression in our study subjects using dual colour flow
cytometry (Fig. 2). In pilot studies, we observed higher
levels of activation marker expression on basophils examined using the whole-blood lysis approach as compared with Percoll isolated, and therefore all subsequent
experiments used the latter approach. As shown in Fig. 3a,
basophils from CIU and allergic subjects had significantly
heightened expression of CD63 in comparison with nonallergics (P < 0.02). Furthermore, there was a trend for
higher CD63 expression in basophils from CIU subjects
relative to allergic subjects. Of note, levels of CD63
detected on basophils were independent of the presence
of platelets which are also known to bear CD63 (data not
shown). In contrast, CD69 expression was significantly
elevated on basophils from allergics, as compared with
non-allergic subjects (P < 0.04). In the case of CIU, CD69
expression was variable, with five of nine subjects having
little expression (P=0.12 vs. non-allergics). However, no
difference was seen in CD203c expression among subject
groups.

For comparison purposes, we optimally activated basophils obtained from an allergic subject and measured
activation marker expression (Fig. 3b). In vitro stimulation
of basophils with doses of grass allergen known to trigger

Basophils from chronic idiopathic urticaria and allergic subjects had

CD63 and CD203c expression not measured following IL-3 incubation.

histamine release (0.25 and 2.5 ng/mL, 30 min at 37 °C) led
to a significant increase in expression of CD63 ( > 400 net
MFI) and CD203c ( > 200 net MFI), as compared with prestimulation net MFI. However, allergen exposure led to
modest shifts in CD69, whereas IL-3 (0.3 ng/mL, 24h) led
to maximal increase (> 200 net MFI) as reported [16].
Thus, the level of CD63 expression observed on basophils
of allergics or CIU subjects was 2.5-5% of the maximal
expression achieved by in vitro activation (Fig. 3b),
respectively, whereas, expression of CD69 was 5% of the
maximal expression achieved by in vitro IL-3 exposure
(Fig. 3b) in both groups.

Serum histamine-releasing activity

Given the observed differences in basophil activation
marker expression, we next compared serum HRA between CIU, allergic, and non-allergic subjects. Serum was
considered positive for HRA if it induced greater than 20%
histamine release above spontaneous release, a criterion
similar to that used by others [2]. As shown in Fig. 4, a
total of seven subjects were considered positive: two nonallergic and five CIU subjects. Surprisingly, none of the

allergic subjects were positive for serum HRA. Serum studies
using RBL-SX38 with unoccupied IgE receptors did not
clearly discriminate HRA among donors (data not shown).

We next examined whether basophil activation marker
expression was associated with the presence of serum
HRA, within each subject group. There was no significant
difference in marker expression between HRA-positive
and-negative subjects in either the non-allergic subject
group or the CIU group (data not shown).

Serum immunoreactivity for FceRIa

We next compared serum immunoreactivity for FceRlx
between CIU, allergic, and non-allergic subjects. As
shown in Fig. 5, a total of seven subjects were serum
positive: three non-allergic, two allergic, and two CIU
subjects. Of note, no significant difference in immunoblot
intensity was seen among subjects. As expected from
earlier studies, there was little overlap between immunoblot-positive and HRA-positive subjects with only two
subjects positive for both serum factors [4]. We next
examined activation marker expression relative to serum
immunoreactivity within each subject group. In all subject
groups, there were no significant differences in marker
expression between positive and negative subjects, relative to the presence of serum immunoreactivity to FeseRla
(data not shown).

To further clarify the activity of identified serum
factors, we examined sera positive for either HRA, immunoreactivity to FeeRIa, or both, for in vitro activation of
basophil marker expression (Fig. 6). All categories of sera
led to modest increases in CD203c levels (~40 net MFI) on
donor basophils after 30 min of exposure, whereas most

sera classes led to a reduction in CD63 expression. No
changes were noted in CD69 expression after serum
incubation.

Discussion

We have found that CD63 expression is increased on the
circulating basophils from CIU and allergic subjects, and
that both groups have significantly higher expression
than non-allergic subjects. In contrast, CD69 expression
levels were similar on basophils from CIU and allergics
and elevated as compared with non-allergics. However, no
difference in expression of CD203c was seen among the
three subject groups. In all cases, levels of activation
marker expression were modest relative to levels achieved
with maximal in vitro stimulation, suggesting that the
level of circulating basophil activation in vivo is far less
than expected with specific stimulation via FceRI activation. Interestingly, higher basophil marker expression
levels have been reported by other groups [18] using a
whole-blood lysis approach, which we observed increased
levels beyond that seen on basophils isolated in parallel
via Percoll. Although we cannot exclude activation of
basophils via our selected isolation approach, we utilized
this procedure to better reflect the status of basophil
activation status in vivo. We have also not found a
correlation between basophil CD63 levels and CD42 presence, indicating that platelet adhesion on basophils is not
leading to falsely elevated CD63 expression. The underlying mechanism behind enhanced activation marker
expression is unclear, but certainly in the case of CD69
and CD63, it may be linked to the presence of cytokines
such as IL-3 which could be expressed in the sera of both
allergic and CIU subjects. It has been noted that both CIU

and atopic subjects share similar levels of elevation in
serum IL-4 as compared with healthy controls [33].

Consistent with the modest levels of basophil activation
markers in our subject groups, we also found little evidence that the presence of circulating autoantibodies to
FceRIa as detected by western blotting, altered basophil
marker expression. This is a rather surprising finding given
the proposed role for these autoantibodies in CIU pathogenesis [23]. We also failed to see a bimodal distribution in
activation marker expression that would suggest that only
a subset of basophils was being activated via autoantibody
presence. Likewise, the presence of serum HRA was not
associated with elevated marker expression in CIU and
non-allergic subjects, and absent in allergic subjects. The
lack of serum HRA in allergic subjects may explain why
some investigators have reported the exclusive presence of
serum HRA in CIU subjects vs. others subjects presenting to
an allergy clinic [2]. However, the presence of serum HRA
was not a distinguishing feature of CIU in our study as also
observed by others [34].

Among the explanations for the lack of association
between the presence of FceRI~ autoantibodies and basophil activation marker expression is the idea that these
autoantibodies can only bind to unoccupied receptors on
the basophil surface or a ‘conditional’ autoimmune state
[35, 36]. However, in past population studies of receptor
densities on basophils, it was noted that the number of
open receptors is fairly constant despite a wide range of
receptor expression [24]. This observation argues against
the existence of in vivo states that would increase the
numbers of unoccupied receptors to permit pathogenic
activation of either basophils or mast cells. However, such
an altered state of increased unoccupied receptors has

Basophil activation in chronic idiopathic urticaria 775

 

been described in the early months of treatment with the
therapeutic anti-IgE, omalizumab [37]. Furthermore, the
existence of FesRIx autoantibodies has also been related
to cross-reactivity with tetanus toxoid and therefore may
offer a further challenge to clearly link these autoantibodies specifically to CIU [38, 39]. These groups have found
naturally occurring FceRIl« autoantibodies in healthy
subjects [38, 39], as we have also observed in this study.
Other groups have also shown the presence of such antiFeeRIx antibodies in other inflammatory, autoimmune
skin diseases, suggesting a broad presence of such autoantibodies [40].

As an aside, we noted allergen dose dependence for
CD203c expression on basophils, supporting the use of a
wide range of allergen doses in assays involving activation markers to detect basophil activation. We also saw
that in vitro exposure of basophils to all categories of sera
(based on HRA or presence of anti-FceRIx antibodies) led
to enhanced CD203c expression and a variable effect on
CD63 expression. From our studies of basophil activation
markers, we have observed high baseline activation marker expression in highly allergic individuals with a subsequent drop in marker expression following stimulation.
This may explain the unexpected decrease in sera-induced
CD63 expression observed in Fig. 6. Although we focused
on the expression of activation markers on basophils of
CIU subjects, recently, several groups have suggested the
use of serum-induced basophil CD63 expression as a
screening test for autoimmune urticaria based on serologic factors [25-27, 34]. However, the disparity in serum
effects on CD63 begins to highlight some of the issues
with broad application of these assays for in vitro diagnosis of clinical allergy or serologic factor status.

In conclusion, we have found that expression of basophil activation markers is increased in CIU and is similar
to that observed in allergic subjects. We also found that
elevated basophil marker expression was not associated
with CIU serologic factors. In addition, serum HRA and
FeeRIa immunoreactivity are not unique to CIU subjects
or related to enhanced basophil marker expression.
