Abstract: Chronic idiopathic urticaria is a common skin disorder characterized by recurrent appearance of wheals and/or
angioedema for more than 6 weeks without an identifiable cause. Consensus guidelines suggest use of leukotriene
receptor antagonists (montelukast or zafirlukast) in patients whose urticaria is resistant to antihistamines. Our objectives
were (1) document the efficacy of montelukast in our patients, and (2) evaluate whether any clinical features or available
laboratory investigations were associated with a response to montelukast.

Patients who received montelukast between the years 2008-2011 (4-year period) were retrospectively identified from
clinic letters. Clinical features and laboratory investigations were collected and analyzed. The primary end point was
adequate control of disease without the need for systemic steroid therapy.

25 patients (10 males and 15 females; median age, 33 years; age range, 13-66 years) with an average duration of urticaria
at 3.8 years received montelukast 10mg daily. 12 patients (48%) were better on montelukast with combined anti-H1 and
anti-H2 therapy, with no statistical significance between median age and duration of urticaria between males and females.
In 11 patients, montelukast had no effect and in 2 patients the urticaria worsened after montelukast was started. 15 patients
had peripheral blood basopenia of which 5 patients responded to montelukast. Two patients had positive antinuclear
antibody, 3 thyroid peroxidase antibodies and 4 with positive basophil histamine release. All 20 patients who had

 

complement C3 and C4 levels done were within normal limits. Four of 6 patients (67%) with positive specific IgE
responded to montelukast and combined anti-H1/H2 therapy.

Almost half of our patients with chronic urticaria responded to montelukast and combined anti-H1 and anti-H2 therapy.
We were unable to identify any clinical features or laboratory markers that were associated with a response to
montelukast. Further studies are required to understand the failure of response of leukotriene inhibition in urticaria.

Keywords: Antihistamine, chronic idiopathic urticaria, leukotriene, montelukast.

INTRODUCTION

The EAACI/GA?LEN/EDF/WAO consensus guidelines
for the diagnosis and management of urticaria published in
2009 was based on expert recommendations from the Third
International Consensus Meeting on Urticaria (Urticaria
2008), joint initiative of the EAACI Dermatology Section,
Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA?LEN),
European Dermatology Forum (EDF) and World Allergy
Organization [1, 2] and highlighted the absence of reliable
assessment tools (mainly laboratory markers) and effective
treatments for this common condition. A subsequent update
from the GA?LEN task force also identified several unmet
clinical needs in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria
[3]. It is estimated that up to 1% of the population suffers
from chronic urticaria (CU) and that all age groups are
affected although the peak incidence is between 20 and 40
years of age. In most cases the disease lasts between 1-5
years, but the duration can be longer in those with severe
urticaria, those with concurrent angioedema, and in those
with the physical component (including a_ positive

autologous serum skin test). Urticaria is characterized by
itchy, red, raised (wheal) and flare skin reactions that lasts
usually a few hours (typically <24 hours) and is classified as
chronic if it lasts >6 weeks. The chronic spontaneous form of
urticaria does not need any stimulus and referred to as
chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) [1-3].

The pathogenesis of CU is complex as illustrated in Fig.
(1). Up to half of patients with CIU have an IgG
autoantibody directed against the alpha subunit of the highaffinity IgE receptor (FceR1@) which is the concept of
autoimmune urticaria [4-6] that leads to persistent cutaneous
mast cell and basophil activation (Fig. 1). The roles of the
coagulation cascade and fibrinolysis activation [7], including
several cytokines [8-21] and the yet elusive soluble serum
factor that leads to release of histamine from basophils
which has been the basis of the serum-induced basophil
histamine release assay (described in detail in the ‘Methods’
section [22, 23]). Although histamine plays a significant role
in diseases like CU and eczema, prostaglandins, leukotrienes
(LTs) and cytokines prolong the inflammatory process and
hence leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) may well
modulate the underlying abnormalities and lead to remission
of urticaria.

The consensus guidelines have adopted the management
of urticaria into (1) avoidance measures and (2)

pharmacotherapy — nonspecific and specific. The avoidance
approach outlines elimination or treatment of eliciting
stimulus or cause (such as NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema, physical causes, treatment of an infectious trigger
etc) that is not possible in all cases (i.e., those with CIU).
The second approach is lowering or inhibiting mast cell
mediator release and the most commonly used non-specific
drugs that inhibit mast cell release are corticosteroids.
Specific treatment approaches involves use of non-sedating
long-acting antihistamine (anti-H1) drugs such as cetirizine,
levocetirizine, loratadine, desloratadine and fexofenadine
provide both anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory effects such
as inhibition of cytokines release from basophils and mast
cells as well as reduction of chemotactic activity of
eosinophils (Fig. 1). Other treatment options that have
significant activity on mediator release on basophils include
the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A [24-32], and
occasionally ultraviolet therapy [33-37].

Montelukast is an orally active LTRA licensed for the
maintenance treatment of asthma (GINA Step 4) and to
relieve symptoms of seasonal allergies. Montelukast binds to
and blocks the action of leukotriene D4 (LTD4) on the
cysteinyl-leukotriene receptor CysLT1 in the lungs, with
almost no interaction with other anti-allergy drugs (Table 1,
Fig. 2). This reduces the bronchoconstrictive and inflamma
tory effects of LTD4 in the airways and therefore not useful
for the treatment of acute asthma attacks. LTs such as LTC4,
LTD4 and LTE4 have important roles in the
pathophysiologic mechanisms of allergic inflammation after
binding to activating receptors, cystenyl-LT1 (CysLT1)
receptor and Cys-LT2 receptor [38-43]. Hence, LTRAs such
as montelukast 10mg once daily or zafirlukast 20mg twice
daily have been employed either as monotherapy or in
combination with Hl-receptor and/or H2-receptor
antagonists, to treat different forms of CU, including cold
urticaria, urticaria related to food additives, chronic
autoimmune urticaria, steroid-dependent urticaria, delayedpressure urticaria, CIU and dermographism with varying
results [44-50].

Data from few systematic clinical trials or case series
suggest that a few patients with chronic and resistant
idiopathic urticaria respond to leukotriene inhibition, but
laboratory markers are still unavailable that would help the
clinician identify which patients are likely to have a
favourable response to montelukast [3]. It has been
suggested that urticaria activity score (UAS, combination of
wheal numbers and intensity of pruritis) be used to monitor
effectiveness of therapy, but no reliable biomarkers are
currently available to monitor the disease activity. Studies
have also reported on the limited efficacy of the UAS and

The objectives of this retrospective study were: (1) to
document the efficacy of montelukast as added therapy in
our patients, and (2) evaluate whether any clinical features or
available laboratory investigations were associated with a
response to montelukast.

METHODS

Patients who received montelukast between the years
2008-2011 (4-year period) were retrospectively identified
from clinic letters. Clinical features of duration of urticaria,
concomitant medication use, autoimmune features or
existing organ-specific autoimmunity were recorded.
Patients who required frequent pulsed courses of
corticosteroids or on immunosuppressive agents to control
the urticaria were excluded from the study.

Laboratory investigations such as the full blood count
(including automated 5-part differential count for basophil
counts [Coulter Gen. S], complement C3 and C4 levels,

urticaria test), samples were sent to the RefLab
(Copenhagen, Denmark) and assay was performed using
previously published validated reports [22, 23]. Briefly,
patient serum in four concentrations (20, 10, 5 and 2.5%) is
incubated with IgE-depleted basophil leukocytes (buffycoat).
Released histamine is adsorbed onto glass microfibers and
detected fluorometrically. Serum-induced histamine release
is then expressed as a percentage of total histamine content,
and as validation studies showed serum from healthy
individuals (n=79) can induce histamine release at maximum
16%, the test is considered positive if the histamine release is
>16.5% [22].

The primary end point was adequate control of CU
without the need for systemic corticosteroid or
immunosuppressive therapy. Patients were seen at various
time points and as the validated UAS were not used to
document control of disease, the score could not be
employed for statistical analyses.

Statistical analyses: Measures of descriptive statistics
were used for initial analysis (Microsoft Excel 2007).
Nonparametric statistical data were calculated using the

A search of the English-language literature was
performed using the following databases (between the years
2009-2011): MEDLINE, BNI, EMBASE, HMIC, CINAHL
and Wiley Interscience. The search terms used were
‘urticaria AND montelukast’, ‘urticaria AND leukotriene’.
Reports with n<5 patients were excluded from this search.

RESULTS

25 consecutive patients who received montelukast for
CIU during the years 2008-2011 were identified from clinic
letters. There were 10 males and 15 females with median age
at 33 years (age range, 13-66 years). The average duration of
urticaria was 3.8 years (duration range, 0.5-12 years). 21 of
25 patients were on both anti-H1 and anti-H2 blockers when
montelukast 10mg once daily at night was started. The
average duration of use of anti-H! therapy in all patients was
1.4 years (range, 0.3-8 years) (Table 2). Five patients had
evidence of other immunoregulatory disorders (4 with
diabetes, 1 hypothyroidism) (Table 2).

Efficacy of Montelukast as Added Therapy

12 of 25 patients (8 males, 4 females) or 48% were better
after start of montelukast as added therapy along with antiH1 and anti-H2 blockade for the urticaria. There was no
statistical significance between median age between males
and females and significant response to montelukast (MannWhitney, unpaired t-test (two-tailed) p=0.57). There was also
no significance between duration of urticaria in males and
females and significant response to montelukast (MannWhitney, unpaired t-test (two-tailed) with Gaussian
approximation, p=0.42). 11 patients had no difference to
their symptoms of urticaria and in 2 patients the urticaria
worsened after montelukast was started. Five patients had
side effects (nausea [1], dyspepsia [1], depression [1], and
worsening urticaria [2]) that affected the duration of use and
may be the outcome (Table 3).

Full blood count revealed basopenia in 15 patients of which
5 responded to montelukast (Table 4). Two patients had positive
antinuclear antibody (ANA), 3 with positive thyroid peroxidase
antibodies and 4 with positive basophil histamine release (HRurticaria test) (Table 4). Only one patient had positive ANA,

Inflammation & Allergy - Drug Targets, 2012, Vol. 11, No.3 239

thyroid peroxidase antibodies and HR-urticaria test who
developed depressive symptoms after montelukast was started
that necessitated stoppage of therapy. All 20 patients whose
complement C3, C4 levels were checked were within normal
limits (reference range for our laboratory, C3 0.9-1.8g/L and C4
0.1-0.4g/L). As regards allergies, one patient was sensitive to
aspirin/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs who stopped
montelukast after one month as there was no benefit. Six
patients had positive specific IgE that ranged between Grade 1
to Grade 3 of whom 4 (66%) responded to montelukast along
with anti-H1 and anti-H2 therapy.

 

We found 6 reports on the several databases [53-58] on
the efficacy of montelukast in urticaria between the years
2009-2011 (Table 5), since publication of the extensive
review by Di Lorenzo et al. [59].

availability and endorsement by consensus guidelines was
the reasons why leukotriene receptor antagonists were
considered as the preferred supplementary agents in our
cohort of patients. Five patients had side effects (including
two patients whose urticaria worsened within 2 weeks) that
affected the duration of use and may be the outcome.

We were unable to find any laboratory features that were
associated with a response to montelukast. We also
recognize the limitation of the automated basophil count that
we used for assessment of basophil numbers in the
peripheral circulation in patients with urticaria [60],
including the possible effect on the basophil numbers with
use of certain medications [60-62], although these patients
were excluded in our study. The autologous serum skin test

test was used to determine the severity of urticaria in our
patients, but the test was unhelpful in being able to
determine whether leukotriene inhibition was more likely to
have an effect.

Although some studies may suggest that use of
leukotriene inhibitors may allow a persistent drug-free
remission, most reports argue against such a diseasemodifying effect. We were unable to verify this as patients
continue to remain on montelukast once it has proven
effective in controlling the disease activity. More head-tohead clinical trials are required, including using drugs such
as dapsone [63], to see which subgroups of patients’ are
more likely to respond to which types of medications until
reliable laboratory markers becomes available. Finally, the
potential of naturally occurring products with antiinflammatory and anti-allergic roles should not be ignored as
these may well be treatments of the future [64-66].
