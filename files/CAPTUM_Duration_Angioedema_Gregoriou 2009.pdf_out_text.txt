Background: Studies investigating etiologic factors in chronic urticaria are based on small populations of a few hundred patients.
In addition, data on prognostic factors of the disorder are scarce.

Objective: To investigate the etiologic and prognostic factors of chronic urticaria on a large population referred to tertiary
specialized hospital departments.

Methods: The study investigated 2,523 patients with chronic urticaria and a negative autologous serum skin test using
anamnesis, and the literature suggested laboratory tests for etiologic factors of the disorder. The patients were prescribed cetirizine
10 mg daily plus treatment of any underlying disorders illuminated by the laboratory investigation. The rescue medicine was
loratadine 10 mg. The patients were evaluated every 3 months. Comparative statistical methods were used to evaluate the
prognostic factors having an impact on the duration of the disorder until resolution of symptoms.

Results: Etiologic factors of chronic urticaria-angioedema were identified in 38.7% of the patients. Physical urticarias had a
prevalence of 17.1% in the population under study. Other common etiologic factors identified included infection (7.7%) and

  

autoimmune thyropathy (7.3%). Multiple regression analysis showed that female gender, long duration of the disorder at the initial
examination, the presence of angioedema, and physical urticarias are associated with worse prognosis of the disorder, whereas
increased self-reported stress and psychiatric disease had no impact on the course of the disorder.

Conclusion: A detailed medical history and selective laboratory tests can illuminate etiologic factors in less than 40% of patients
with chronic urticaria. Prognostic factors identified to impact the natural history of the disorder could be helpful when designing
studies assessing the efficacy of therapeutic agents for chronic urticaria.

Antécédents: Les études portant sur les facteurs étiologiques des urticaires chroniques sont fondées sur de petites populations
de quelques centaines de patients. En plus, les données sur les facteurs pronostiques de cette affection sont rares.

Objectif: Examiner les facteurs étiologiques et pronostiques des urticaires chroniques chez une large population référée aux
services hospitaliers spécialisés tertiaires.

Méthodes: 2,523 patients souffrant d’urticaire chronique et présentant un sérum autologue négatif ont été évalués selon leur
antécédents médicaux ainsi que grace aux tests suggérés par les publications spécialisées afin de détecter les facteurs étiologiques
de l’affection. Les patients ont regu une dose quotidienne de 10 mg de cetirizine, en plus des médicaments prescrits pour toute autre

 

affection révélée par les tests s'il y a lieu. Le médicament de sauvetage était la loratadine a 10 mg. Les patients ont été évalués aux 3
mois. Des méthodes statistiques comparatives étaient utilisées afin d’évaluer les facteurs pronostiques qui influent sur la durée de
l'urticaire depuis son apparition jusqu’a la disparition des symptémes.

Résultats: Les facteurs étiologiques des angioedémes ont été identifiés chez 38,7 % des patients. Les urticaires physiques étaient
prévalents chez 17,1 % de la population sous examen. D’autres facteurs étiologiques fréquents comprennent les infections (7,7 %) et
la thyropathie auto-immune (7,3 %). L’analyse des régressions multiples a montré que le sexe féminin, la durée de I’affection au
moment du premier examen ainsi que la présence d’angioedémes et d’urticaires physiques sont associés a de mauvais pronostics,
alors que le niveau de stress rapporté par le patient et la maladie psychique n’ont aucune incidence sur le cours de I’affection.

Etiologic Aspects and Prognostic Factors of Patients with Chronic Urticaria 199

Conclusion: Le détail des antécédents médicaux et les tests de laboratoire sélectifs peuvent jeter la lumiére sur les facteurs

étiologiques de moins de 40 % des patients présentant des urticaires chroniques. Les facteurs pronostiques identifiés comme
pouvant influer sur le cours de I’affection seront utiles dans la conception d'études permettant d’évaluer I’efficacité des agents

thérapeutiques.

RTICARIA-ANGIOEDEMA is a frequent disorder. It
U. estimated that 12 to 25% of the general population
will manifest urticaria once in their lifetime.’ Chronic
urticaria (CU) lasts more than 6 weeks, and the etiology
often remains unexplained. The disorder may last for
several years despite treatment; in fact, it has been
estimated that only 20 to 40% of patients are cured after
3 years and that 20% of patients still present symptoms 20
years after onset.”*? Data on the natural history and
prognosis of CU are scarce in the medical literature. The
object of this study was to evaluate possible etiologic
aspects and prognostic factors associated with CU.

Patients and Methods

Patients with CU presenting in two supraregional tertiary
university hospital departments from 2001 to 2006 were
included in the study. Cases of CU-angioedema were
defined as such when the duration was 6 weeks or more.
Patients with acute urticaria and hereditary angioedema
were excluded.

In all patients, demographic data and clinical variables
of the disorder were obtained, including age, gender,
occupation, and duration since symptom onset. Causal
factors were obtained through anamnesis, dermatologic
and general physical examinations, and laboratory tests,
including complete blood count; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR); fasting glycemia levels; hepatic, renal, and
thyroid function tests; serology for autoimmune diseases;
antithyroglobulin and antimicrosomal antibodies; toxoplasmosis; hepatitis B and C; total IgE immunoglobulin
serum levels; urinanalysis; and stool analysis for parasites.
Facial sinus and chest radiographs, upper digestive tract
endoscopy, and skin lesion biopsies were performed
according to the medical history and physical examination.

An autologous skin serum test (ASST) conducted as
previously described* and skinprick tests (SPTs) were
evaluated in all patients. Challenge tests in patients
reporting an association of symptoms with physical stimuli
were performed to diagnose physical urticarias. Delayed
pressure urticaria was diagnosed after application of a
5.5 kg weight on the shoulders, arms, and thighs of
patients for 15 minutes, and lesion appearance was

evaluated 6 hours later.” Acquired cold urticaria was
diagnosed by the ice cube test as previously described.®
Dermographism was elicitated by a dermographometer.”
Heat urticaria was diagnosed after a hot bath test exposing
arm skin to 42°C hot water. Cholinergic urticaria was
diagnosed by evaluating lesions after the patient exercised
by ascending and descending a staircase.

All patients were prescribed cetirizine 10 mg daily plus
treatment of any underlying disorders illuminated by the
aboratory investigation. The rescue medicine was loratadine 10 mg. All patients were followed up every 3 months
to monitor the response to therapy and confirm the
proposed etiologic aspects illuminated by the medical
history and laboratory tests.

Patients with a positive ASST were excluded from the
statistical analysis as the etiology of their CU was already
confirmed and there was no need for further investigation.
Patients who repeatedly failed to attend follow-up visits
were also excluded from the study to avoid the addition of
etiologic data with decreased credibility.

Patients with positive SPTs to foods were counseled to

follow an avoidance diet. Foods were considered to be

 

 

associated with the CU if the diet resulted in recession of
urticaria symptoms. Nasal challenge was performed on
patients with positive SPTs to inhalants, and elicitation of
wheals was considered an association of the identified
inhalant to the urticarial symptoms.

A database was constructed, and data were analyzed
using SPSS version 10.01 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).
Frequencies between qualitative variables were analyzed
using the chi-square test and between quantitative
variables using the Student ftest. Analysis of variance
was used to compare quantitative variables in multiple
subgroups. Multiple regression analysis was used to
correlate the duration of the disorder until resolution,
after the initial examination, with age, gender, stress, and
clinical manifestation of the disorder.

disorder had a statistically significantly longer duration in
women (f-test = 3.2, p = .001). Men presented more
frequently with just urticaria whereas women presented
with urticaria accompanied by angioedema, and the
difference was statistically significant (y* = 9, p = .01).
A history of atopy had a similar distribution among sexes.
Eight hundred seventy-three (34.6%) of the patients were
office workers, 801 (31.7%) were occupied with household
tasks, 281 (11.7%) were pupils and students, 253 (10%)
were pensioners, 185 (7.3%) were self-employed, and 130
(5.2%) were farmers.

Physical urticarias identified included 345 (13.6%)
patients with cholinergic urticaria, 46 (1.8%) patients with
acquired cold urticaria, 42 (1.7%) patients with delayed
pressure urticaria, 3 patients with solar urticaria, 2 patients
with vibratory angioedema, and 1 patient with aquagenic
urticaria. CU symptoms emerging after infections and/or
recessing after treatment of infections were identified in
94 (7.7%) of the patients. Autoimmune thyropathy was
diagnosed in 184 (7.3%) patients. A malignancy with
recessions and exacerbations resulting in similar fluctuation of urticarial symptoms was identified in 30 (1.2%)
patients.

Six hundred twenty-two patients (24.65%) had positive
SPTs in inhalant allergens and 537 (21.3%) in food
allergens. Nasal challenge with the identified inhalants
elicited wheals and was considered to be associated with
the CU in 45 (1.8%) patients. Food allergens were
considered to be associated with CU in 33 (1.3%) patients
who reported recession of symptoms after following an
avoidance diet. Drugs were identified as etiologic factors of
CU in 7 (0.3%) patients, and discontinuation of the agent
resulted in recession of urticarial symptoms.

Blood tests revealed eosinophilia in 6.3%, an elevated
ESR in 3.1%, positive antinuclear antibodies in 5.4%, and
abnormal C-reactive protein in 9.3% of the patients. Stool
test revealed helminths in three and protozoa in two

 

patients. The cause of CU-angioedema was clarified in
38.7% (n = 977) of the patients. Causal hypotheses are
presented in Table 2. Aggravating factors reported by
patients included stress (38.7%, 977), consumption of
wine (3.1%, 77), and consumption of stronger alcoholic
beverages (2.3%, 59).

Follow-up evaluation revealed that in 43.3% (n =
1,092) of the patients, their urticaria resolved 6 months
after the initial evaluation at the hospital departments and
in 31.2% (n = 787), the disorder resolved within 2 years,
whereas 25.5% (n = 644) still had flares after 2 years of
treatment. Statistical analysis showed statistically significantly prolonged duration for women (y* = 6.65, p =
.036). Multiple regression analysis showed a slower
resolution for women, older patients, patients with a
longer duration of the disorder at the initial examination,
and patients presenting with angioedema, whereas subjective report of aggravation by stress was not associated
with the duration of the disorder (Table 3). Levels of total
IgE (r = —.003, p = .89) and a history of atopy (y° = 2.48,
Pp = .29) also did not have any influence on the duration of
the disorder.

The disease is more refractory for women, older patients, patients with angioedema, and patients who report a long history of urticarial symptoms at the

time of the initial examination.

CU revealed that (1) women presented statistically
significantly more frequently with a physical urticaria (7?
+ 67.3, p = .00); (2) the duration of the disorder was
prolonged in patients with physical urticaria (t-test + 2.42,
p = .01); and (3) subjective report of stress was associated
more frequently with physical urticaria than with CU (x?
= 104.4, p = .00).

Discussion

The etiology of CU remains unexplained in 70 to 75% of
patients despite extensive laboratory investigation.”* This
fact, along with the long duration of the disorder and the
severe impact on patients’ quality of life,?’’ suggests that
studies assessing etiologic and prognostic factors are still of
merit.

The majority of patients in the population under study
were women in a 3:1 ratio to men. Several studies reported
a similar gender ratio.'!2-'5 However, ratios of 2:1!°?° and
1:1°12 or even the prevalence of male patients*’ have also
been reported. The most frequent age group was patients
35 to 45 years old, confirming data reported by other
investigators. °*!6!9714

Urticaria without angioedema was evident in 52% of
men and 28.3% of women, angioedema alone in 8.8% of
men and 6.4% of women, and urticaria plus angioedema
in 39.2% of men and 45.3% of women, data analogous to
those reported by Sibbald and colleagues and Green and
colleagues.”””® Men presented statistically significantly
more often with urticaria alone, whereas women presented
with urticaria accompanied by angioedema. Occupation
had no influence on the type of clinical manifestation or
the duration of the disorder. Most of the patients were
married and living in urban areas.

The duration of the disorder at the time of the initial
examination was 25.7 + 1.9 months for men and 33.3 +
1.4 for women, and the duration was statistically
significantly longer for women. These data pertain to
patients who presented in supraregional academic departments who should be expected to present symptoms for a
longer duration, have already been unresponsive to various
treatment regimens, and be older than patients presenting
in primary care units or to private practice specialists. A
study of patients in a Dutch tertiary center reported a
mean duration of 4.9 years, whereas a recent study from a
Thailand hospital unit reported a mean duration of 1.1
years since symptom onset.*°””

The cause of CU-angioedema was clarified in 38.7% of
the patients. Percentages reported in the literature are
17%,"' 18%,°* 21%,” 29%,” 31%,”* 37.6%,” and
44%,'”'® Physical urticarias were confirmed in 17.1% of
patients, with reports in the literature ranging between 10
and 50%.7!**

Infections of the oral cavity, upper respiratory tract,
and genitourinary area; facial sinus infections; and fungal
infections were the most frequently identified infections in
the population under study. The role of infections in CU
remains controversial. Infections in CU patients have been
shown to be as frequent as in other patient groups.*°
Several studies investigating the role of Helicobacter pylori
in CU have reported controversial results.*' Even though
research on infectious factors that might be associated with
CU is still ongoing,” a recent meta-analysis concluded
that there are not enough clear-cut data to affirm a direct
link between CU and infectious diseases.**

The increased prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity in
CU has been documented in several studies.**°° Patients
in the population under study exhibited an association of
202 Gregoriou et al

thyroid disease and CU even in the absence of a positive
ASST. Antithyroid antibodies have been associated with
the presence of anti-immunoglobulin E receptor antibodies in some patients, and investigators have suggested
that the coexistence of these antibodies might be attributed
to parallel autoimmune events.*”

The prevalence of malignancy that could be etiologically associated with CU was found in 1.2% (n = 30) of
the patients. This is in accordance with data from other
studies suggesting a low incidence of malignancy among
the etiologic factors of CU.**"*

An abnormal ovary hormonal profile in conjunction
with menstrual disorders was identified in 1.1% (n = 29)
of patients. Studies have shown that progesterone may
account for a wide spectrum of cutaneous reactions,’ and
urinary progesterone of female rats has been reported to
cause contact urticaria in laboratory personnel.*° Low
levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate have also been
associated with CU.*!

Drug-induced CU was identified in six patients (two to
aspirin, two to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and
two to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). The
role of these agents as an exacerbating factor in CU
through pseudoallergic mechanisms has been well documented in the medical literature.*”

Patients with angioedema presented with a more
refractory course of CU, as shown by multiple regression
analysis. Toubi and colleagues also highlighted the
association between angioedema and disease duration.**
Other investigators have reported a lack of association

between angioedema and ace

patients with a longer duration of the disorder at the initial
examination had a more refractory subsequent course of
the disease. This might also explain the worse prognosis in
senior citizens. Physical urticarias were also associated with
a more prolonged and refractory course of the disorder in
accordance with the data presented by van der Valk and
colleagues.*” Women were also found to present with a
more refractory course of the disorder. A history of atopy,
stress, and psychiatric disorders were not found to affect
prognosis of CU.

In the population under study, patients with physical
urticarias reported stress as an exacerbating factor
statistically significantly more frequently than patients
with CU. This might be attributable to the fact that
physical urticarias have been associated with a more severe

 

impact on the patients’ quality of life, as reported by Poon
and colleagues.'°

Conclusion

Investigation of CU in this large population has confirmed
that a detailed medical history and selective laboratory
tests can illuminate etiologic factors in less than 40% of
patients. Female gender, long duration of the disorder at
the initial examination, and the presence of angioedema
and physical urticarias are associated with worse prognosis
of the disorder. The impact of these findings should be
taken into consideration when designing studies assessing
the efficacy of therapeutic agents for CU.
