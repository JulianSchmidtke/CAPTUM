Objectives: To investigate the correlation between the clinical characteristics of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) and the results of
autologous serum skin test (ASST).

Methods: This prospective observational study was performed in
the Motahari Allergy Clinic and included 69 patients referred to the
clinic with a diagnosis of CIU. ASSTs were performed on all patients. We compared the disease characteristics, including duration
severity, number of urticaria, and size of urticaria between those
with positive and negative results of ASST.

Results: Of 69 patients with CIU, 39 (56.5%) were female and 30
(43.5%) were male with a mean age of 32.5 + 12.3 (range 6-62)
years. Patients with a positive ASST had a significantly higher number of wheals (P = 0.043) with larger sizes (P = 0.031). They also
had higher frequencies of wheals (63.8% vs. 46.4% daily; P =
0.039) and higher disease activity scores (1.57 + 0.9 vs. 2.01 + 1.6;
P = 0.044). The disease activity score was positively correlated with
the size of the wheals, duration of the wheals, duration of the disease, and total number of wheals. Patients with positive ASST results had significantly higher frequencies of arthritis (P = 0.027).

Conclusion: Positive ASST results are associated with more severe
disease determined by the larger wheals’ size, longer duration of the
disease, and higher frequencies of the disease. As ASST reveals the
autoimmune basis of the CIU, it can be concluded that CIU patients
with autoimmune basis will suffer from more severe disease.

Key Words: autologous serum skin test (ASST), chronic idiopathic
urticaria (CIU), clinical findings

hronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is a skin disorder char
acterized by recurrent pruritic wheals, often accompanying angioedema lasting for at least six weeks.' CIU impairs
the quality of life to a great extent and thus is one of the most
frustrating skin diseases. Studies in the field of its pathogenesis have revealed the autoimmune basis for the disease. It is
shown that in about 25-35% of patients, the active IgG autoantibodies against IgE or the high affinity IgE receptor
(FceRI) are responsible for the disease manifestations.> > This
autoimmune basis of the disease led to the development of a
diagnostic test using autologous serum for inducing the whealand-flare skin reaction.' The autologous serum skin test
(ASST) is used for diagnosis of CIU. Previous studies have
shown that up to 50—80% of patients with CIU have positive
ASST results.'7 The sensitivity and specificity of ASST are
about 80% in the best conditions.*

The ASST has become a popular and readily available
test for diagnosis of CIU in clinical practice. However, some
authors have questioned the usefulness of the test because of
the variability of its positivity in patients with CIU, ranging
from 4% to 76% in the literature.’ This may be explained due
to patient selection and differences in methodology and re
Key Points

* Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is a frustrating skin
disorder characterized by recurrent pruritic wheals,
often lasting for at least six weeks.

* Therapeutic autologous serum skin tests (ASST) can
decrease the severity and duration of CIU by initiating
immunosuppressive mechanisms.

* During the present study, some patients requested repeat ASSTs because they claimed that ASST had resulted in the decline of their symptoms.

* Positive ASST results are associated with more severe
disease determined by larger wheal size, longer duration of the disease, and higher frequencies of the
disease.

sponse interpretation. Taskapan et al'® reported that 52.5% of
patients with CIU had positive ASST levels, while the positivity rate of ASST was found to be 55.5% in normal controls.

According to these conflicting studies, the value of ASST
for CIU diagnosis is yet to be determined. Our knowledge
regarding the clinical significance, as well as the correlation
of ASST results with disease characteristics, is very limited.
We conducted this study in order to investigate the correlation between the clinical characteristics of CIU and the results
of ASST.

Materials and Methods
Study Subjects

This prospective observational study was performed from
January 2009 through February 2010 in the Motahari Allergy
Clinic, a tertiary health center affiliated with the University of
Medical Sciences in Shiraz, Iran. We included a total of 69
patients (39 females and 30 males) referred to the clinic with a
diagnosis of CIU. The diagnosis was based on the presence of
recurrent, itchy hives lasting for at least six weeks and lacking
angioedema. The study was approved by the Shiraz University
of Medical Sciences Ethics Committee and all subjects gave
their written consent. The protocol of the study was approved by
the institutional review board at the university.

We excluded patients with physical urticaria and those
with angioedema. We also excluded patients who were using
corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs or antihistamines
at the time of venipuncture. Patients with immunosuppressed
conditions such as diabetes mellitus, kidney or bone marrow
transplants, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and those
with primary immunodeficiency diseases such as X-linked
agammaglobulinemia, severe combined immunodeficiency
(SCID), and common variable immune deficiency (CVID)
were also excluded from the study.

Study participants received a detailed history regarding
the nature of the CIU and its characteristics, and all patients
underwent a precise physical examination in order to determine the clinical characteristics of the disease. We recorded
the personal and family history of allergy and autoimmune
diseases, duration of the disease, accompanying clinical signs
and symptoms, duration of skin lesions, frequency of attacks,
and skin manifestations. The disease activity was determined
according to the EAACI /GA2LEN urticaria activity score’!
(Table 1) ranging from 0 to 3, which is indicative of mild,
moderate, or intense disease. Patients were divided into two
groups according to ASST results (positive ASST vs. negative ASST), and the clinical findings were compared between
these two groups.

Methodology of ASST

Patients were asked to stop antihistamines and steroids at
least 72 hours and one week, respectively, before performing

the test.'* To perform the ASST, 5 ml of venous blood was
collected in a sterile vacutainer and allowed to clot at room
temperature for 30 minutes. The sample was then centrifuged
at 2000 rpm for 15 minutes in order to separate the serum.
Autologous serum (0.05 mL) was injected intradermally using a | mL insulin syringe (30 gauge needle) to the left
forearm 2 cm below the cubital fossa and similarly 0.05 mL
of 0.9% sterile normal saline (control) was injected intradermally to the left forearm. In addition, 0.05 mL of histamine
(10 g/mL) was injected into the volar aspect of the right
forearm as a positive control (Fig.). A serum-induced erythematous wheal with a diameter of 1.5 mm more than the
saline-induced response within 30 minutes was taken as a
positive test. Wheal and flare response was also measured at
30 minutes.

with 5% degree of freedom or proportions. Chi-square test
was used to compare the nonparametric data, including the
prevalence of clinical signs and symptoms between those
with positive and negative results for ASST. Independent
t-test was used to compare the parametric data including age,
duration of disease, duration of urticaria, and disease severity
between two groups. A two-sided P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

Overall, we included 69 patients with CIU; 39 (56.5%)
were female and 30 (43.5%) were male, with a mean age of
32.5 + 12.3 (range 6—62) years. Of the 69 patients with CIU, 41
(59.4%) tested positive for ASST. Table 2 summarizes demographic and disease characteristics of the patients and compares
them between two study groups. Patients with positive ASST
had significantly higher numbers of wheals (P = 0.043) with
larger sizes (P = 0.031). They also had higher frequencies of
wheals (63.8% vs. 46.4% daily; P = 0.039) and higher disease

activity scores (1.57 + 0.9 vs. 2.01 + 1.6; P = 0.044). The
disease activity score was positively correlated with size of the
wheals (r = 0.561, P = 0.002), duration of the wheals (r =
0.436, P = 0.013), duration of the disease (r = 0.312, P =
0.022) and total number of wheals (r = 0.351, P = 0.031).
Female patients (2.31 + 1.5 vs. 1.24 + 1.3; P = 0.035) and
those with a positive family history of allergy (2.28 + 1.6 vs.
1.34 + 0.8; P = 0.039) also had higher scores of disease activity. There wasn’t any correlation between age and disease activity score (r = 0.021, P = 0.543).

Table 3 compares the prevalence of clinical manifestations in patients with positive and negative ASST results. The
most common clinical finding was pruritus, detected in 66
(95.7%) patients, followed by erythema in 61 (88.4%) patients, and fatigue in 38 (55.1%). Patients with positive ASST
results had significantly higher frequencies of arthritis (P =
0.027). However, there wasn’t any significant difference between both groups regarding the frequencies of other clinical
findings.

Discussion

In the present study, we tried to investigate the correlation between the results of ASST and the clinical characteristics of the disease. We found that positive ASST results are
associated with more severe disease determined by larger
wheal size, longer duration of the disease, and higher frequencies of the disease. As ASST reveals the autoimmune
basis of the CIU, it can be concluded that CIU patients with
positive ASST will suffer from more severe disease. In other
words, the autoimmune reaction will aggravate the clinical
outcome and presentation.

ASST is a simple test which can be performed in the
office with reliable results. It is based on the presence of
autoantibodies against IgE or FceRI.*~> These antibodies have
been recognized to play an important role in the pathogenesis
of CIU.*° However, its accuracy strictly depends on the methodology and case selection. In this study, the ASST was
found to be positive in 59.4% of the patients, which is comparable to previous studies.'*>-” However, some other studies reported lower positivity for ASST in CIU patients.'*-'*
In this regard, George et al’? found that only 34% of the
patients had a positive ASST. Sabroe et al* found functional
autoantibodies in 31% of the CIU patients. Because of variability of the results of this test, some authors have questioned the usefulness of the test.” The range of ASST positivity in CIU patients is reported to be 4—76% in different
studies. Taskapan et al’ reported a high frequency of ASST

114

positivity in healthy controls, compared to patients with nonallergic asthma and rhinitis, allergic rhinitis, or bronchial
asthma and chronic idiopathic urticaria (55.5% vs. 52.5%). It
can be concluded that ASST positivity might be a nonspecific
phenomenon and thus its value should be re-evaluated.

The median duration of disease was found to be 41.6 +
36.9 and 38.8 + 37.3 months in those with ASST positive
and negative results, respectively, which was consistent with
Sabroe et al.* George et al'? found that patients with a positive ASST had more frequent attacks compared to the ASSTnegative group (P = 0.038). These results were further confirmed by Sabroe et al,° which showed that patients with
autoantibodies in their sera have more severe attacks, according to several parameters including frequency, duration of
individual episodes, and sites involved. These are in concordance with our findings, which noted frequent long-lasting
episodes in ASST-positive patients.

The most common clinical finding in patients with CIU
was found to be pruritus, followed by erythema and fatigue.
Patients with ASST positive results had a significantly higher
prevalence of arthritis compared to ASST negative patients.
Juhlin'* showed that ASST-positive patients had significantly
more systemic symptoms; ie, gastrointestinal symptoms and
flushing.? However, we did not find any association between
clinical findings and the results of ASST, which is consistent
with that being previously reported by George et al'? Previous studies have shown that patients with CIU have increased
risk for developing other autoimmune diseases such as thyroid disease, vitiligo, diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia,
and rheumatoid arthritis.*'> In this regard, it was shown by
George et al'* that ten patients tested positive for antinuclear
antibodies (ANA), out of which one patient also had a positive ASST. Although a higher frequency of autoimmune disease has been reported in patients with autoimmune urticaria,
they did not find an increased incidence of other autoimmune
disease. None of our patients had simultaneous autoimmune
disease or thyroid abnormalities, which are contrary to
O'Donnell et al.!*

As mentioned above, none of our patients had thyroid
abnormalities determined by normal values for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). In this regard, Leznoff and Sussman’® studied the association of chronic urticaria with thyroid autoimmunity with the hypothesis that thyroid
autoimmunity plays an important role in the pathogenesis of
CIU. They found that patients with thyroid autoimmunity had
a higher prevalence of CIU and vice versa.'® We failed to
detect such an association, which might be explained due to
our small study population. Thus, performing larger studies
of thyroid dysfunction in CIU patients will shed some light on
this issue.

ASST is a simple, inexpensive, and noninvasive test
which can be performed easily in a clinic or office setting by
the physician. It is the only available test known for diagnosing CIU in an outpatient setting. ASST also has therapeutic

© 2011 Southern Medical Association
potential and is used as accessory management when conventional management is unsuccessful. Therapeutic ASST can
decrease the severity and duration of CIU by initiating immunosuppressive mechanisms.'’ However, Staubach et al’®
did not find any evidence supporting the therapeutic potential
of ASST. During the present study, some patients referred to
our clinic requested repeat ASSTs because they claimed that
ASST had resulted in the decline of their symptoms. The
efficacy of repeated autologous serum injection in treatment
of CIU needs to be evaluated in future studies.

Conclusion

Positive ASST results are associated with more severe
disease determined by larger wheal size, longer duration of
the disease, and higher frequencies of the disease. As ASST
reveals the autoimmune basis of CIU, it can be concluded that
the autoimmune reaction in CIU patients will aggravate the
clinical outcome and presentation of the disease.
