antihistamines as the cornerstone in therapy for chronic urticaria (CU), while other drugs, such as omalizumab, are
conceived as second-line alternatives. In regards to omalizumab, despite advances in the management of CU, there
are still open questions about timing, dosing, and objective measures for clinical response. This study was designed
to portray the use of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in chronic urticaria management, as well as the effectiveness and treatment patterns of omalizumab in CU, as seen in a real-life setting in Latin America.

Methods: This is a retrospective observational study, involving 72 Latin American patients with chronic urticaria
treated with omalizumab. Patient reported outcomes and treatment patterns, response, quality of life improvement and discontinuation were analyzed.

Results: From the 72 patients, 91.7% (n = 66) were assessed through PROs, where urticaria control test (UCT) was
the most used (79.2%; n = 57). Overall, 80.0% (n = 44) responded to omalizumab at some point of the treatment.
Omalizumab 300 mg was associated with earlier response compared to lower doses. Regardless of dosage, most
patients assessed with CU-Q2oL improved quality of life (80.8%; n = 21). With respect to omalizumab discontinuation, 20.8% (n = 15) patients interrupted omalizumab before the 3rd month of treatment (p = .000).

Conclusions: The present study highlights how the use of PROs and omalizumab in Latin America differ from
guidelines’ recommendations and clinical trials. Even though most patients were initiated under omalizumab
300 mg, most of them finished with lower doses. Regardless of dosage, most patients responded to omalizumab
and improved quality of life at some point during treatment. However, such features were seen earlier with
omalizumab 300 mg. Regarding treatment discontinuation, one-fifth of patients interrupted omalizumab before

the third month.

 

Background

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common skin disorder characterized by
spontaneous recurrent wheals, that may present with associated
angioedema and occur for at least 6 weeks.’ Often, urticaria needs to be
differentiated from other medical conditions such as anaphylaxis (in the
case of acute urticaria), autoinflammatory syndromes, or urticarial
vasculitis, where hives with or without angioedema can also occur.!
Updated guidelines recommend omalizumab, an anti-IgE monoclonal
antibody, in cases of antihistamine refractoriness. It was first reported to
be effective in patients with chronic autoimmune urticaria who were
symptomatic despite antihistamine therapy, with subsequent clinical
trials supporting its efficacy and safety for the treatment of CU.?°
Furthermore, treatment with omalizumab has been shown to improve
quality of life, effectively treat relapses after treatment discontinuation,
and is safe for long-term treatment.’ Despite the current knowledge of
omalizumab for CU, studies of this subject in Latin America (LA) are
largely missing; therefore, little is known about the use and effects of
omalizumab in Latin America (LA).

As evidenced by a recent real-world systematic review of omalizumab
for CU, most studies originate from developed countries in Europe and
the United States, where omalizumab is readily available for physicians
to use, and it is usually reimbursed by health insurance.° In contrast, in
Latin America, economic and health insurance limitations appear to influence the prescription of omalizumab to a greater extent. For instance,
in a publication addressing omalizumab discontinuation in LA, it was
found that most patients could not achieve a 3-month regimen since
health insurance programs did not support this therapy, and patients
could not afford the costs.’ These circumstances provide a unique setting
and challenge for the use of omalizumab in the treatment of patients with
CU, and they may apply to other developing countries outside of LA.

In view of the previous findings, our study aims to objectively assess
the effectiveness and describe the treatment patterns of omalizumab for
CU, particularly regarding dose, and the use of patient reported outcomes
(PROs), as seen in a real-life setting in LA. We believe the knowledge and
learnings obtained from real-life experiences of treating CU patients with
omalizumab might help to establish a framework for physicians working
in places with similar health care systems and socioeconomic conditions.

Methods

This is a retrospective observational study, involving 72 Latin
American (Ecuador, n = 23; Peru, n = 26, Brazil, n = 9; Colombia, n = 6;
Argentina, n = 4; Mexico, n = 2 and Dominican Republic, n = 2) patients
with chronic urticaria (CU) treated with omalizumab from January to
December 2017. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were
reported. PRO use and treatment patterns, treatment regimens and
response, quality of life improvement and medication discontinuation
were analyzed. To be included, patients were required to have CU
diagnosis according to the EAACI/GA7LEN/EDF/WAO guideline and at
least one application of omalizumab, either 150 mg or 300 mg, within the
previous designated period.’ Data were collected by physicians from
clinical records from either private and/or public practice, under the
supervision of an ethics committee.

The primary variable analyzed was treatment response/urticaria
control, defined as an Urticaria Activity Score summed over 7 days
(UAS7) <6 and/or Urticaria Control Test (UCT) >12 at any point during

the treatment.*° In addition, patients were assessed for how long they
took to achieve response and stratified into early responders (response
during the first month), intermediate responders (response between the
first and third month) and late responders (response after the sixth
month).*!°" Finally, the degree of response was classified into complete
responders (UAS7 = 0) and partial responders (UAS <6 but not (0) Pies
The degree of response could manifest at any point of the treatment and
was exclusively analyzed in patients with two UAS7 measurements,
including their baseline status.

For quality of life improvement response, a change in the minimal
clinical important difference (MCID) of 15 points in the total CU-Q2oL
score from the baseline measurement was considered meaningful.!?
Time to achieve quality of life improvement was categorized applying the
same criteria as for treatment response. The improvement could be
objectively measured at any point during treatment.

Ethical considerations

This study was approved by the ethics committee: Comité de ética e
Investigacion en Seres Humanos (CEISH).

Statistical analyses

Descriptive statistics were performed for demographic and a number
of clinical variables including age, gender, years with disease, medications, PRO patterns/preferences, effective omalizumab dose and frequency. Chi-square tests for association were performed between the
independent variable omalizumab dose and the dependent variables,
type of responder (according to time to achieve response), degree of
response and quality of life improvement. A Cramer's V test was use
further to assess the strength of association if present.

In addition, we performed separate analyses concerning individuals
completing 3- and 6-months regimens as previously investigated in
clinical trials.!° A two-way mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
performed to understand the effect of omalizumab dose and time on
UAS7, UCT and each of the CU-Q2oL domains scores. Chi-square tests for
association were performed between the independent variable omalizumab dose and the dependent variable responses (present/absent), and
quality of life improvement.

In addition, omalizumab discontinuation was evaluated at 3 and 6
months. Adjusted binomial logistic regressions were performed to
ascertain the effects of age, gender, angioedema, years with urticaria,
Omalizumab dose, treatment response and quality of life improvement
on the likelihood that participants discontinued omalizumab before the 3
and 6 months of treatment.

Results
Descriptive statistics

A total of 72 patients were included in this analysis. The average age
was 43.3 years (SD 14.3), and 55 (76.4%) were female. The average
duration of urticaria before diagnosis was 3.8 years, and the mean
treatment duration with omalizumab was 7.7 months (SD 7.7). The most
common primary diagnosis of urticaria was chronic spontaneous urticaria (91.7%), wheras only 6 (8.3%) patients had a primary diagnosis of
chronic inducible urticaria (Table 1).

Baseline assessment

Among the 72 patients, one-third of the patients used all 3 PRO tools,
the UAS7, the UCT and the Cu-Q2oL, one-third used 2 tools, and onethird used 1. Moreover, 91.7% (n = 66) were assessed objectively using
questionnaires, while 8.3% (n = 6) were assessed by recall and physical
exam only (p = .000). Overall, UCT was the most used questionnaire
(79.2%; n = 57; p = .000), followed by UAS7 (58.3%; n = 42; p = .157)
and CU-Q2oL (41.7%; n = 30; p = .157). When two questionnaires were
used, the combination of UAS7 plus UCT was most often used (71.4;
n = 15; p = .050). Patterns and combination of questionnaires are
described in Table S1. Questionnaire use over time is depicted in Figure 1

From the 42 patients assessed through UAS7, most patients had severe disease (47.6%; n = 20; p = .000). Based on the use of the UCT, CU
in 96.5% (n = 55; p = .000) of patients was not controlled when omalizumab was initiated (Table $2). The mean for UAS7, UCT and each CUQ2oL domain are summarized in Table $3.

Treatment with omalizumab

The mean number of omalizumab doses applied during the time
period of the study was 5.45 (SD, 3.15). The mean treatment duration
was 7.67 months (SD, 7.67). 56.9% (n = 41) and 43.1% (n = 31) of
patients started on omalizumab 150 mg and 300 mg monthly, respectively. Of the 72 patients, 7 (9.9%) completed a 3-month treatment
course, and 10 (13.8%) patients received omalizumab for 6 months.
Omalizumab dosing over time is illustrated in Figure 2. The remaining
patients received different treatment schemes other than those used in
clinical trials (Figure 3). Concerning other medications, all patients used
antihistamines and 29.2% (n = 21) used steroids. Additional use of
medication is summarized in Table S4.

Four of five patients treated with omalizumab benefit from the
treatment and most respond fast.

Among the 72 patients evaluated, 55 had at least one follow-up office
visit to assess the degree of response to omalizumab using the UAS7 and/
or UCT. Overall, 80.0% (n = 44) had some degree of benefit to omalizumab, while 20.0% (n = 11) had no response at all. The mean time to
response was 1.75 months (SD, 1.28). Furthermore, 45.5% (n = 25) of
patients were considered early responders, 29.1% (n = 16) intermediate
responders and 5.5% (n = 3) late responders (p = .000). There was a
weak but statistically significant association between omalizumab dosing
and the speed of onset of the response (y2(3) = 7.577, p = .048;
@C = 0.387, p = .042). The overall treatment response and proportions of
each type of responder according to omalizumab dose are illustrated in
Figures 4A and B, respectively.

Degree of response according to UAS7.

Among the 37 patients assessed using the UAS7 at least twice during
treatment, 54.1% (n = 20) of patients presented with complete response
at some point during treatment (p = .622). Among the complete responders, 13 were treated with Omalizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks.!“!°
There was not a statistically significant association between Omalizumab
dose and complete response (y2(1) = 1.205; p = .272). The mean time to
achieve complete response was 3.3 months (SD, 2.34), with the highest
complete response rate at the 4th month of follow-up. The degree of
response according to UAS7 is depicted in Figure 5.

Quality of life improvement

Among the 26 patients assessed with CU-Q2oL who presented with at
least one follow-up, 80.8% (n = 21) of patients experienced some degree
of quality of life improvement at some point during their treatment
(p = .002).

Among these patients, 53.8% (n = 14) were early improvers, 15.4%
(n = 4) intermediate improvers, and 11.5% (n = 3) late improvers
(p = .008) (Figure 6). There was not a statistically significant association
between Omalizumab dose and type of improvement (y2(2) = 3.962;
p =.330).

Response and quality of life improvement in patients completing the
3- and 6-month treatment courses.

Using the UAS7, UCT and CU-Q2oL score values as continuous variables, a two-way mixed ANOVA showed that there were no statistically
significant interactions between the omalizumab dose and time for UAS7
and CU-Q2oL. The main effect time showed a statistically significant
difference for all mean scores. However, the main effect of omalizumab

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the use of omalizumab in Latin America and its role in the management of CU. In
addition, this study highlights how the experiences with omalizumab by
Latin American physicians contrast with evidence-based recommendations provided by international guidelines.

Our study provides real-life data on the timing and dosing of omalizumab in the treatment of CU patients as well as on the use of PRO

measures for assessing their clinical response.'° '* Currently, there are
no reliable biomarkers to identify and measure disease activity in CU.'°
Consequently, the use of PRO instruments remains crucial to evaluate
and monitor various aspects of CU including activity, severity, control,
and quality of life.'° Among the available PRO instruments, UAS7 has
been considered the gold standard and has been extensively used in
clinical trials.”° Despite this, the reported use of PRO instruments is low,
as evidenced by a recent “real world” systematic review by Bernstein and
colleagues. According to this review, PRO instruments were used to

assess the response of CU patients to omalizumab in only 41.7% of
studies, with UAS7 being used in 28.6% of studies and UCT only in 3.6%
of studies.° In our study, 58.3% of patients were evaluated with UAS7,
while almost 80% of patients were assessed using the UCT at baseline.

The higher reported use of UCT in our patients, compared to UAS7
and CU-Q2oL, might be the result of the former being simpler and faster
to use among physicians and patients.'° On the other hand, CU-Q2oL was
the least used PRO at baseline (approximately 37.5%), with a similar low
overall use throughout the patients’ follow up. The CU-Q2oL provides
detailed information on the effects of CU on different QoL domains, and it
can be useful to compare changes over time including those that occur in
response to different treatments. On the other hand, it is generally
considered to be more time consuming than other PRO measures, both
for patients as well as physicians.'? Our findings are consistent with a
European study that reported low use (approximately 50% of patients) of
the CU-Q2oL at baseline evaluation.”!

The current version of the international urticaria guideline recommends second generation H1-antihistamines as the first line treatment,
and it suggests updosing this medication up to 4-fold when CU control
cannot be achieved with standard doses.' Of the studied patients, we
found that nearly half of them were treated following this reeommendation at the start of omalizumab treatment, a finding comparable to that
of a recent global report.” Nevertheless, the level of awareness of CU
guidelines among Latin American physicians is still low, and the fear of
side effects when updosing 2nd generation H1-antihistamines is still
high.2224

For antihistamine-refractory patients, omalizumab has been shown to
be very effective and safe in the treatment of CU.'° In fact, several studies
point to high discontinuation rates for other medications, e.g.

antihistamines, over time when omalizumab is used for the treatment of
patients with CU.° Our study confirms this and shows a significant
decrease in the use of pharmacologic agents by the end of omalizumab
treatment.

Clinical trials have shown that 300 mg of omalizumab monthly is the
most effective starting dose in CU. In real life clinical practice, however,
approximately 25% of patients are still started on 150 mg of omalizumab.” In the present study, 43.1% of our patients were initiated on this
latter regimen. The most likely explanation for this is that, in Latin
America, the economic burden, insurance restrictions, and omalizumab
availability limit the use of 300 mg as the starting dose.’ While it is clear
that 300 mg is the best starting dose, there may be cases where the use of
150 mg may be preferred for treatment continuation, for example in patients with partial response to 300 mg every 4 weeks, who may experience
a better response when dosed with 150 mg every two weeks.”°

Even though most of our patients were initiated at a dose of 300 mg
every 4 weeks, by the 6th month of follow-up, 150 mg every 4 weeks was
far more common. This finding relates to a recent systematic review, in
which 300 mg had the highest initiation rates, but was able to be stepped
down to a lower dose by the end of treatment.° Changes in dosage appear
to be common in clinical practice. It is still unclear, however, if these
changes occur secondary to treatment success and achieving urticaria
control or due to limitations in access to omalizumab as previously
described. Regardless of dosage, we found an overall response rate at any
point in treatment of 80%, with 20% of patients not responding at all.
These findings compare to previous real real-life studies.”° In contrast,
complete responder rates appear to be more heterogeneous. An earlier
real-life study by Sussman et al. found a complete response rate of 79% at
any point during treatment, while a recent retrospective observational
I. Cherrez-Ojeda et al.

study by Nettis and colleagues observed a complete response of 67%.7°?”

In our study, the complete response rate was lower, achieved only in
54.1% of cases, and presenting with the highest rate at 4th and 5th
months as depicted in Fig. 5. In the POLARIS trial, the proportion of
complete response versus placebo for omalizumab 300 mg was even
lower than that, 36%, and omalizumab 150 mg resulted in only 19%
complete responders.”° In the present study we did not find any statistically significant association between omalizumab dose and complete
response, although most complete responders were treated with omalizumab 300 mg. Clearly, complete responder rates are highly variable,
and the patient population treated, the tools and definitions used to
assess complete response, and when this is done after the initiation of
omalizumab treatment are important variables.

When considering the time to response to omalizumab treatment, our
analyses show that omalizumab 300 mg was associated with higher rates
of earlier responders. In our study, 45.5% of individuals were early responders, as assessed by UAS7 and UCT, of which 36.4% were treated
with Omalizumab 300 mg (p = .042). This finding compares very well
with the ASTERIA I and II clinical trials, in which the rate of early responders for omalizumab 300 mg was 37% and 51%, respectively.!°

Regarding omalizumab discontinuation, 20.8% of patients interrupted their treatment before 3 months. This contrasts with ASTERIA II
and ASTERIA I, where overall treatment discontinuation rates at 3
months of treatment were 6% and 15%, respectively.° The discrepancies
between our study and clinical trials in treatment discontinuation highlight how much omalizumab regimens vary in the real-life setting and
that they are frequently subject to factors that may interrupt the course of
treatment such as poor response to treatment, socioeconomical problems,
lack of time for treatment, insurance changes, symptom resolution or,
less commonly, adverse effects.2°?° For instance, in a publication
addressing omalizumab discontinuation in LA patients, 65.4% patients
could not complete a 3-month treatment course since health insurance
programs did not support this therapy and patients could not afford the
costs.’ Discontinuing omalizumab has been associated with disease
relapse and significant increase in symptoms, as suggested by other
studies.'4'>°° In a real-life study, 61% of patients who discontinued
treatment with omalizumab reported worsening of symptoms, however,
some of these patients were retreated successfully with omalizumab.*!

It is well known that improvement in disease activity does not always
translate to better quality of life. CSU disease activity assessed by UAS7 is
a significant predictor for overall CU-Q2oL score, but patients with a low
UAS7 score may still have markedly impaired quality of life.!°°? This
highlights the importance of assessing CU patients with multiple tools in
order to achieve a more complete status of disease impact. In our study,
omalizumab improved mean quality of life scores over time, a finding
that has also been reported in previous clinical trials and other real-life
studies.'°°? Overall, we found that 80.8% of patients experienced
improved quality of life at some point during treatment. This finding is
comparable to a recent systematic review, in which quality of life outcomes measured by CU-Q2oL improved 71.1%°

Limitations

There are several limitations in our study that require mentioning.
First, the 72 patients included did not achieve enough power to generate
statistically significant results for all comparisons. For instance, chi
square tests with 3° of freedom as well as two-way-mixed ANOVA procedures presented difficulties either because of type II errors or assumptions violations. Moreover, even though we describe and portray
the variability in patterns and preferences in PRO and omalizumab use in
the real-life clinical practice in LA, the heterogeneity of data limits the
extrapolation and generalization of some observations/conclusions. The
results reported in this study might have been influenced by other factors
that have not been considered in the analyzes, and as our conclusions
concerning the potential benefits of omalizumab are mostly descriptive,
they are subject to bias. Despite including few patients with chronic

World Allergy Organization Journal 12 (2019) 100011

inducible urticaria, the PRO evaluated in this study have not been validated for this disease. Another potential limitation is that it was not
possible to consider in detail the clinical background of each patient,
such as the type of medications prescribed and their effectiveness prior to
the start of omalizumab treatment, or the reason why patients could not
achieve follow-up after the last omalizumab dose received. Despite these
limitations, many of the reported observations from this real-life study
correlated fairly well with the pivotal omalizumab clinical trial results
and other real-life studies from other regions of the world.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that patient-reported outcomes measurements, in
addition to clinical judgement, are useful to record improvements or lack
thereof, in patients with chronic urticaria treated with omalizumab. Even
though most patients are initiated on omalizumab 300 mg, many can be
maintained well with lower doses. Regardless of the dose selected, most
patients experienced improved quality of life at some point during treatment. Good responses were observed earlier with omalizumab 300 mg.
Treatment discontinuation remains a problem: 20% of patients stopped
omalizumab before the third month for various reasons not related to the
medication's effectiveness. In summary, there are still many unanswered
questions regarding the use of omalizumab for CU in clinical practice. We
believe that these questions can ultimately only be answered by additional
studies, using registries, real life settings and controlled trials.
