Concomitant treatment with omalizumab and cyclosporine for

chronic spontaneous urticaria

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is defined as urticaria with or
without angioedema occurring for more than 6 weeks without an
identifiable etiology. Based on consensus guidelines, the first-line
treatment consists of second-generation H; antihistamines of up
to 4 times the maximum daily recommended dose.! However, 25%
to 42% of patients may fail to achieve clinical response despite these
regimens.” Add-on therapies include first-generation H; antihistamines with or without a leukotriene receptor antagonist,
whereas omalizumab or cyclosporine (CsA) are subsequent treatment considerations for CSU.'

Omalizumab is the only United States Food and Drug
Administration—approved next-line therapy for CSU based on scientific evidence reported in randomized, placebo-controlled trials.'
© Alternatively, CsA may be prescribed off-label for CSU management
in the United States.' Although typically used for organ transplant
rejection prophylaxis, CsA can control CSU at comparatively lower
doses. Omalizumab is regarded as the preferred add-on therapy
because of its safety profile of having less toxicity, given that CsA may
cause adverse effects such as renal dysfunction and hypertension.

Omalizumab-refractory CSU represents a difficult case for the
patient and physician. Definitive management guidelines are lacking for these cases, and there are no formal studies investigating
concomitant treatment with omalizumab and CsA. Herein, we
report our institutional experience on patients with omalizumabrefractory CSU who received add-on therapy with very low-dose
(<2 mg/kg/d) to low-dose (2-4 mg/kg/d) CsA.

We treated 6 adult patients (age range: 24-55 years; 4 women)
with omalizumab-refractory CSU who started concomitant CsA. All
patients had persistent urticaria with or without angioedema
despite having received at least 12 weeks of omalizumab (300 mg
every 4 weeks; median duration: 22 weeks [interquartile range: 1529]). Four patients had elevated chronic urticaria indices. Two skin
biopsies revealed mixed eosinophilic/neutrophilic infiltrates,
whereas 1 was predominantly eosinophilic. Table 1 summarizes the
patients’ clinical characteristics.

Given the CSU severity, CsA was added, and omalizumab was
continued in an attempt to lower the most effective CsA dose. All
patients continued to receive omalizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks.
Initial CsA doses ranged from 1.1 to 3.7 mg/kg/d (all started on 100 mg
twice daily). During the treatment period, patients had follow-up
visits with blood pressure and laboratory monitoring (complete
blood cell count, renal/liver function, glycated hemoglobin, and
random CsA levels) 2 to 4 weeks after CsA initiation, followed by every
1 to 3 months, unless dosing was increased. All patients achieved
complete resolution (Urticaria Activity Score over 7 days [UAS7] = 0)
while on both omalizumab and CsA (median time to resolution:
5 weeks [interquartile range: 1-15]). Maximum CsA doses ranged
from 1.5 to 3.8 mg/kg/d, whereas the lowest maintenance doses
ranged from 0.2 to 2.1 mg/kg/d. Three patients required up-titration
(4-16 weeks after initiation) of CsA before achieving clinical resolution. If controlled, the CsA dose was lowered and the patient monitored for maintained clinical response. At most random monitoring
points, subimmunosuppressive levels of CsA were detected; there
were no toxic levels. Four patients successfully tapered off CsA, 1
patient continued to receive concomitant therapy and the other
required intermittent CsA courses. Omalizumab continuation was

confirmed in 3 patients; 2 were lost to follow-up after CsA discontinuation. One patient was controlled with fexofenadine alone. One
patient developed hypertension, which may have been related to CsA,
although she had other underlying risk factors. Table 1 summarizes
the CsA doses and administration and other treatment regimens.

Severe CSU unresponsive to omalizumab is especially challenging.
Initial studies investigating omalizumab for CSU revealed that after
12 weeks of therapy (300 mg every 4 weeks), approximately 52% to
66% of patients achieved a partial response (UAS7 <6), whereas 34%
to 44% achieved complete clinical response (UAS7 = 0).*° Likewise,
Sanchez et al’ reported that approximately 29% of patients had
inadequate CSU control (Dermatology Life Quality Index <5) after 16
weeks of omalizumab. Based on a meta-analysis of 7 randomized,
placebo-controlled trials (n = 1312 patients), 36% achieved a complete response (UAS7 = 0) with omalizumab.’

In the literature and real-life practice, not all patients readily
improve with omalizumab, likely reflecting a complex CSU pathophysiology not exclusively limited to immunoglobulin E—mediated
degranulation events. An option for nonresponders is an increased
omalizumab dosage of 450 mg to 600 mg, but the efficacy of this
approach has not been formally examined. An analysis of the 3
largest CSU-omalizumab clinical trials revealed that the median
time to achieve a UAS7 score of 0 ranged from 8 to 13 weeks;
however, there was a subgroup of late responders at 24 weeks,
potentially reflecting differences in antiimmunoglobulin E effects
on basophils compared with mast cells.®

Thus, CsA may be considered the most potentially efficacious
next-line option to exert immunosuppressive effects on T lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells. In a recently published meta-analysis encompassing 909 patients, low-dose to
moderate-dose (4-5 mg/kg/day) CsA controlled CSU at 4, 8, and 12
weeks with response rates of 54%, 66%, and 73%, respectively.”
Hypertension and abnormal serum creatinine levels occurred in
6.2% (very low dose), 12.8% (low dose), and 10.3% (moderate dose) of
patients. Overall, the adverse event rate directly correlated with CsA
dose and treatment duration.’ Similarly, in a prospective study (n =
27) by Serhat Inaloz et al,'° 70% of patients achieved a 25% reduction
in UAS7 score with CsA dosage of 2.5 mg/kg/d for 4 weeks.

The patients included in this case series achieved complete CSU
resolution at very low to low-dose CsA while continuing standard
omalizumab therapy. We recognize the possibility that some of our
patients could represent either as CsA responders (and omalizumab
continuation was of minimal efficacy) or omalizumab late responders. The former theorized individuals (patient #2, 5, 6) had 24
or more weeks of omalizumab and responded to CsA within 1 to 2
weeks. Of note, no moderate-dose CsA was needed, suggesting that
omalizumab possibly attenuated a need for higher CsA doses.
Further studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying omalizumab-refractory CSU and its optimal treatment.

To summarize, omalizumab with concomitant low-dose CsA
administration is a safe and effective treatment for patients with
omalizumab-refractory CSU. All CsA doses were less than 3.8 mg/kg/d,
and the lowest effective doses were all considered very low dose except
for 1 patient. Two-thirds of patients were able to taper off of
CsA without CSU recurrence. Furthermore, most patients except 1
responded within 12 weeks of treatment. One developed hypertension
managed with CsA dose reduction and an antihypertensive agent.
Based on our limited experience, we support the alternative treatment
regimen of concomitant low-dose CsA with close monitoring for
