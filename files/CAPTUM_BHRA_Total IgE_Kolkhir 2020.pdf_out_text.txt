What is already known about this topic? While blood basopenia has been linked to severe, antihistamine-resistant, and
autoimmune urticaria, the role of eosinophils in chronic spontaneous urticaria is largely unknown.

What does this article add to our knowledge? Low blood eosinophil counts in patients with chronic spontaneous ur
ticaria can point to severe disease and poor response to treatment.

How does this study impact current management guidelines? Eosinophil count is a cost-effective and easy-to-perform
parameter approved by current urticaria guidelines. It may help physicians to identify the right patients for choosing the

next step in the chronic urticaria algorithm.

 

BACKGROUND: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is
characterized by the degranulation of skin mast cells and the
influx of basophils and eosinophils to affected skin sites. Blood
basopenia has been linked to severe antihistamine-resistant CSU
and type IIb autoimmunity, whereas the role of eosinophils in
CSU is largely unknown.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze data from 1613 patients with CSU
from 2 centers to study the prevalence, role, and relevance of
eosinopenia in CSU.

METHODS: Peripheral blood eosinophil and basophil counts
were measured by automated hematology analyzers. Patient files
were screened for clinical characteristics, results of laboratory
tests, the autologous serum skin test, the serum-induced basophil histamine release assay, and response to second-generation
H,-antihistamines and omalizumab.

RESULTS: Ten percent of patients with CSU had eosinopenia.
Eosinopenia was associated with the female sex, high disease
activity, autologous serum skin test and basophil histamine
release assay positivity, low total IgE, and high levels of Creactive protein and IgG-antithyroperoxidase (P < .007).

Nonresponders to second-generation H,-antihistamines or
omalizumab had significantly lower eosinophils as compared
with responders (P < .05 and P < .01, respectively). Blood
eosinophil counts correlated with basophil counts (r = 0.396; P
< .001), and 81% of patients with CSU with undetectable eosinophils had basopenia. The combination of eosinopenia and
basopenia is a better predictor of nonresponse to secondgeneration H,-antihistamines than eosinopenia alone (odds ratio
of 9.5 vs 4.8).

CONCLUSIONS: Eosinopenia in patients with CSU is
associated with type IIb autoimmunity, high disease activity, and
poor response to treatment. Eosinophils should be explored as
biomarkers and investigated for their contribution to the
pathogenesis of CSU. © 2019 American Academy of Allergy,

INTRODUCTION

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common and
debilitating disease defined by the recurrence of unprompted
itchy wheals, angioedema, or both for more than 6 weeks. : Type
I autoimmunity (“autoallergy,” with IgE against autoallergens)
and type IIb autoimmunity (IgG—anti-FceRI/IgE) are held to be
involved in the pathogenesis of most CSU cases.” Both result in
the degranulation of skin mast cells and subsequent wheal formation, as well as cytokine release, which results in the influx of
inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils.°* Although blood basopenia has been
linked to severe, antihistamine-resistant, and autoimmune
CSU,?* the role of eosinophils in CSU is largely unknown.

Eosinophils are a subset of granulocytes described by Jones in
1846 and stained by Ehrlich in 1879. IL-5, IL-3, and GM-CSF
are responsible for the maturation and release of eosinophils in
the bone marrow and their migration into the blood.'” Eosinophils provide protection against helminth infections by the
actions of their peptide mediators including major basic protein,
eosinophil peroxidase, eosinophil cationic protein, and
eosinophil-derived neurotoxin. Recently, unexpected new roles
of eosinophils in tissue repair, metabolic homeostasis, and thermogenesis have been reported.”'' Eosinophils are also increased
in allergic responses, and they contribute to the pathogenesis of
asthma and other allergic disorders."”

Eosinophils are potentially interesting in CSU for several
reasons. |~ First, eosinophils are present in both the lesional and
nonlesional skin of patients with CSU.'*'* Second, there is
bidirectional interaction between mast cells/basophils and eosinophils mediated by cell-cell contacts through cell surface receptors and the production and release of mediators.'? For
example, IgG autoantibodies against the low-affinity IgE receptor
FceRII/CD23 on eosinophils are able to induce histamine release
from basophils through production of major basic protein by
eosinophils.'°'” Major basic protein and eosinophil peroxidase
can induce histamine release from human skin mast cells through
nonimmunological activation of — MAS-related G
protein—coupled receptor X2. Recently, the expression of
MAS-related G protein—coupled receptor X2 on mast cells has
been shown to be upregulated in the skin of patients with severe
chronic urticaria.'“ In addition, eosinophils express tissue factor,
which can activate the coagulation cascade, leading to the generation of thrombin and mast cell degranulation via thrombin
action on protease-activated receptors 1 and 2.'2'820 ‘Third, a
correlation between the extent of eosinophilic infiltration of lesions and CSU severity has been reported. '* Furthermore, a
contribution of eosinophils to the pathogenesis of CSU has been
suggested by the observation of an effective anti—IL-5-targeted
treatment with mepolizumab or reslizumab in individual patients with CSU.*!"*

For the definition of eosinopenia and basopenia, we used cutoff values of <0.05 x
10°/L and <0.01 x 10°/L, respectively.

To better define the role and relevance of eosinophils in CSU,
we analyzed data from a large cohort of patients with CSU from
2 urticaria centers”? addressing the following questions: (1) How
often do patients with CSU show reduced blood eosinophil
counts? (2) Is eosinopenia in patients with CSU relevant? (3) Is
eosinopenia linked to basopenia, a previously described marker of
difficult-to-treat CSU?

METHODS
Patients

We analyzed data from 1613 patients with CSU from the urticaria centers of Charité—Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Germany (n =
1383), and Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, Russia
(n = 230). Because all data were pseudonymized and analyzed
retrospectively, an ethics committee review was not required or
obtained. CSU was defined as recurrent whealing, angioedema, or
both reoccurring for more than 6 weeks because of known or unknown causes.’ Patients with chronic inducible urticaria only and
patients with urticarial vasculitis were excluded. Duration of the
disease, age, and other characteristics of the patients are presented in

Table I. Additional results of the study

Blood collection and analysis

Blood was drawn and analyzed for routine patient care. From the
patients’ files, we collected information regarding the following
laboratory tests: complete blood cell count including eosinophils and
basophils; C-reactive protein; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; Ddimer, fibrinogen; complement C3, C4; ferritin; IL-6, TNF; total
serum IgE, IgA, IgG, IgM; IgG—antithyroperoxidase (TPO),
IgG—antithyroglobulin, IgE—anti-TPO; and eosinophil cationic
protein. The methods were the same for most parameters from both

 

centers and the normal/reference ranges and units of measure were
the same. Some tests, for example for eosinophil cationic protein, IL6, TNF, and ferritin, were performed only in one of the centers.
Eosinophils were measured in 1259 patients with CSU. The
number of patients analyzed per clinical or laboratory parameter is

Assessment of blood eosinophil and basophil counts

Peripheral blood absolute eosinophil and basophil counts were
measured by automated hematology analyzers (XN-1000 or XT2000i, Sysmex, Kobe, Japan) in the local central laboratories of both
centers. Reference values were the same and for eosinophils were
defined as less than 0.7 x 10°/L and for basophils as 0.01-0.09 x
10°/L. For the definition of eosinopenia/low blood eosinophil
counts, we used a cutoff of less than 0.05 x 10°/L, the most
frequently used in the literature.””?° We defined basopenia as less
than 0.01 x 10°/L, as previously described.’ The minimum
detectable values were 0.01 x 10°/L for both parameters.

 

Clinical parameters
We analyzed data on age, sex, duration of CSU, presence of

 

concomitant angioedema, and comorbid allergic diseases. Allergic
iseases were assessed if these diseases were present at the time of

 

assessment and included asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, and food allergy. We
analyzed the patients’ records on history of autoimmune diseases
including autoimmune thyroid diseases, vitiligo, rheumatoid
arthritis, celiac disease, psoriasis, insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, pernicious anemia, and
autoimmune hepatitis.

Disease activity was determined using the urticaria activity score
(UAS), which was calculated as the sum of the itch (no = 0, mild =
1, moderate = 2, intense = 3) and the wheal score (no wheals = 0,
<20 wheals/24 h = 1, 20-50 wheals/24 h = 2, >50 wheals/24 h =
3) for 7 consecutive days (UAS7; minimum = 0, maximum = 42)
before blood analysis.' Patients with CSU were divided into 3
groups according to CSU activity (severity): low disease activity, 0 to
15 (urticaria-free, well-controlled CSU, or mild CSU); moderate
disease activity, 16 to 27 (moderate CSU); and high disease activity,
28 to 42 (severe CSU).**

Patient files were screened for results of the autologous serum skin
test (ASST) and of the serum-induced basophil histamine release
assay (BHRA). The ASST is a screening test for type IIb autoimmune urticaria that evaluates the presence of histamine-releasing
serum factors of any type, including IgG autoantibodies against
FceRI or IgE.*”*! The ASST result is regarded as positive when the

serum wheal is 1.5 mm or more as compared with that of the

 

negative control (saline). The BHRA is used to test patients with
CSU for basophil-degranulating effects of their serum, for example,
because they have functional IgG—anti-FceRI/IgE antibodies. The
BHRA is considered positive when the serum-induced release of
histamine is more than 16.5% of the spontaneous release.**

Of 1613 patients with CSU, 222, 9, and 31 patients were treated
with standard or high doses of second-generation antihistamines
(sgAHs), corticosteroids, and both, respectively, at the time of the
blood sampling and/or within a week before it. A total of 346 and
519 patients with CSU did not receive sgAHs and corticosteroids,
respectively. Of these patients, 249 patients did not use both sgAHs
and corticosteroids. Whether the remaining 380 and 1050 patients
with CSU received sgAHs and corticosteroids, respectively, was
unknown.

 

The response to treatment with sgAHs was evaluated in 93 patients with CSU from the Moscow cohort on the day of blood

 

collection as described before.”* Briefly, patients were asked how
much they suffered from CSU symptoms in the last 4 weeks (1, very

J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT
JANUARY 2020

much; 2, much; 3, somewhat; 4, a little; 5, not at all), how often the
treatment for CSU was not enough to control symptoms in the last 4
weeks (1, very often; 2, often; 3, sometimes; 4, seldom; 5, not at all),
and how they considered the overall efficacy of treatment (1, not
effective; 2, poor response; 3, good response; 4, very good response).
Patients were regarded unresponsive to sgAHs when they chose
answer options 1 and/or 2 for all 3 questions.

The association between eosinophil counts and omalizumab
treatment was analyzed in 147 patients with CSU from the Berlin
cohort. Other results of this study population have been published
elsewhere.” Briefly, omalizumab 300 mg was injected at day 1 and
after 4 weeks. The treatment efficacy was evaluated using the UAS
for 4 consecutive weeks at 4 and 8 weeks. Patients were divided into
3 groups according to their response to the treatment: nonresponders
(a reduction of <30% in UAS7), partial responders (a reduction of
30%-89% in UAS7), and complete responders (a reduction of
>90% from baseline in UAS7). Of 147 patients, 19 patients with
CSU were nonresponders to the first omalizumab injection. Of 67
partial responders to the first omalizumab injection, 16 were complete responders and 3 were nonresponders after the second injec
 

tion. Of 61 complete responders to the first omalizumab injection,
10 were partial responders and 1 was a nonresponder later. Eosinophil counts were collected from 147, 95, and 84 patients at day 1,
after 4 weeks, and after 8 weeks, respectively.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for
the Social Science (IBM SPSS version 25.0; IBM Corp, New York,
NY). Figures were made using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, Calif). Demographic characteristics of patients
with CSU were reported using descriptive statistics. Distribution of
numerical variables was analyzed with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
Nonparametric tests were used for not normally distributed data.
Results are expressed as median and interquartile range. Correlations
were assessed by Spearman rank test. Comparison analyses between
the groups were carried out using ‘{° test, the Mann-Whitney U test,
and the Friedman test. P values less than .05 were considered
significant.

RESULTS

10% of patients with CSU have low blood
eosinophil counts, and eosinopenia is associated
with basopenia

Of 1259 patients with CSU, 129 (10.2%) had low counts of
blood eosinophils (Table I), and blood eosinophils were not
detected at all in 3.3% (42 of 1259) of patients. All basopenic
patients with CSU (14.4%) had undetectable blood basophils.
Most of the patients with CSU with undetectable eosinophils
also had undetectable basophils (80.9%, 34 of 42), whereas only
22.7% (34 of 150) basopenic patients had undetectable eosinophils. Thirty-four of 1244 (2.7%) patients had undetectable
eosinophils and basophils in their blood.

Female patients with CSU had significantly lower blood
eosinophil counts compared with male patients with CSU (P =
.001). Blood eosinophil counts were decreased in patients with
CSU with concomitant autoimmune disease and increased in
patients with CSU with concomitant allergic disease. Blood
eosinophil levels were not found to be linked to angioedema, age
of the patients, or the duration of CSU (see Tables El and E2).

Low blood eosinophil counts are associated with

high urticaria activity

Blood eosinophil counts and disease activity were found to be
negatively correlated, albeit weakly; that is, the lower the patients’ blood eosinophil counts, the higher their disease activity
(P< .001; see Table E2). Patients with high CSU disease activity
had significantly lower blood eosinophil counts compared with
patients with low or moderate CSU disease activity (see
Table El). One of 5 patients with high CSU activity (17.6%,
UAS7 > 27) was eosinopenic compared with 7.0% and 9.2% of

patients with moderate (UAS7 = 16-27) and mild (UAS7 < 15)
CSU activity, respectively (Figure 1).

Eosinopenic patients had higher disease activity compared
with patients with normal or high counts of blood eosinophils
(P = .006; see Figure E2 in this article’s Online Repository at
www, jaci-inpractice.org). High CSU activity was seen in onethird of patients with low blood eosinophil and/or basophil
counts as compared with 15% of patients with normal or high
blood eosinophil and basophil counts (see Figure El in this
article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org).

Low blood eosinophil counts are associated with
ASST and BHRA positivity

ASST-positive (ASST+) patients had significantly lower
counts of blood eosinophils and basophils compared with ASSTnegative (ASST—) patients (see Table E1). Eosinophil counts
were low in 15.8% of ASST+ patients compared with 7.0% of
ASST— patients (Figure 1). Also, BHRA-positive (BHRA+)
patients had significantly lower blood eosinophil counts
compared with BHRA-negative (BHRA-—) patients (see
Table El). Eosinophil counts were low in 24.1% of BHRA+
versus 5.7% of BHRA— patients with CSU (Figure 1). Vice
versa, eosinopenic patients with CSU had higher rates of ASST
and BHRA positivity compared with patients with CSU with
normal or high blood eosinophil counts (see Figure E2).

Blood eosinophil counts in patients with CSU are
correlated with blood basophil counts, C-reactive
protein, lgG—anti-TPO, and total IgE

In patients with CSU, blood eosinophil counts showed a
strong positive correlation with blood basophil counts (r =
0.396; P < .001) and a weak negative correlation with C-reactive
protein, D-dimer, IgM, and IgG—anti-TPO levels. Moderate/
weak correlation was observed between eosinophils and total IgE,
leukocyte, and platelet counts (see Table E2). Patients with low
blood basophil counts, low total IgE, high C-reactive protein, or
high IgG—anti-TPO had significantly decreased blood eosino
phil counts (see ‘Table E1). Vice versa, eosinopenic patients with
322 KOLKHIR ETAL J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT

patients with CSU and normal controls or patients with acute
urticaria, but these studies were small and heterogeneous in their
findings (see Table E4 in this article’s Online Repository at www.
jaci-inpractice.org). We showed, for the first time, that eosinophils are reduced in the blood of 1 in 10 patients with CSU,
which seems to be not random and more common than in the
general population.

Eosinopenia is associated with autoimmune CSU

Our results suggest that eosinopenia is associated with type IIb
autoimmune CSU (aiCSU) endotype associated with IgG—antiIgE/FceRI. First, eosinopenia as well as aiCSU*’ are characterized
by a high disease activity and low blood basophil counts. Second,
we observed a strong association between low blood eosinophil
counts and ASST and BHRA positivity. E-Azim and El-Azim*
also reported lower blood eosinophil counts in ASST+ patients
with CSU, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, in serial biopsies of ASST-induced wheals
of patients with CSU, eosinophils appeared at 30 minutes and
persisted at 48 hours. Eosinophil degranulation was seen at 2
hours.*” However, in our study, some ASST+ patients with CSU
had normal eosinophil counts, suggesting that not all patients with
aiCSU are eosinopenic or eosinopenia is transient. Sabroe et al”?
observed significantly more activated eosinophils in wheals of
more than 12-hour duration in patients with CSU without
IgG—anti-IgE/FceRI than with these antibodies as assessed by
BHRA. This indicates that eosinophil activation may occur earlier
or persist for a shorter period in patients with autoantibodies. OF
18 patients with CSU with IgG—anti-FceRI antibodies, eosinophil
predominance in the lesional skin was seen in 72% (13 of 18) of
patients as compared with 53% of patients with CSU without
IgG—anti-FceRI antibodies.*!

Finally, eosinopenia was also associated with other features of
aiCSU such as low total IgE levels and high IgG—anti-TPO
levels.“? For example, elevated antithyroid antibodies were
associated with BHRA positivity in patients with CSU.”

%

 

Low blood eosinophil counts, in patients with CSU,
are associated with poor treatment responses to
sgAHs and omalizumab

To our knowledge, our study is the first to show that patients
with CSU with low blood eosinophil counts are more likely to be
nonresponders to sgAHs or omalizumab than patients with CSU
with normal or high blood eosinophil counts. Association between eosinopenia and response to sgAHs may be explained by
the correlation of eosinophil counts with CSU activity and
autoimmune markers. Many patients with severe and/or autoimmune urticaria generally have poor response to therapy with
sgAHs.° “4 For example, in a study by Hluilan et al,“
antihistamine-resistant CSU was characterized by a higher disease activity, longer duration of wheals, and ASST positivity. In
most studies,°“""? but not all,“° ASST and BHRA positivity
and/or basopenia were linked to a lack of response to
antihistamines.
The same correlations were seen between urticaria activity,
ASST and BHRA positivity, and response and/or time to
symptoms relief with omalizumab.’”*”“* Ferrer et al“” reported
high baseline UAS7 and slow decrease of symptoms as a predictor of rapid symptoms return after omalizumab withdrawal.
Positive BHRA and ASST predicted a slow response to
omalizumab.”

 

 
324 KOLKHIR ETAL

We did not find a significant difference in eosinophil counts
before and after omalizumab treatment, which is consistent with
the data from another study.” Notably, high eosinophil counts
were associated with maintenance of remission at 3 months after
stopping omalizumab treatment.”

To summarize, type IIb aiCSU, high disease activity, basopenia, and eosinopenia are linked and all associated with poor
response to sgAHs and omalizumab in patients with CSU.

In CSU, eosinopenia may be associated with the
recruitment of eosinophils in the skin and/or their
immunologic destruction in the blood

Further studies are needed to explore the mechanisms of
eosinopenia in patients with CSU. Low blood eosinophil counts
may reflect their recruitment to the skin during active disease.
Eosinophils are present in the lesional and nonlesional skin of
patients with CSU.'*" For example, Fujisawa et al'* observed
eosinophil infiltration in the wheals in 7 of 9 patients with severe
CSU but not in the skin from normal subjects. Alternatively,
eosinopenia in CSU may be due to the immunologic destruction
of eosinophils in the blood. Interestingly, a single dose of the
serum from a 45-year-old woman with episodic urticaria and
complete eosinopenia was able to significantly suppress the
eosinophil counts in monkeys for up to 12 hours. Furthermore,
the patient’s serum showed a complement-dependent IgGrelated activity and was able to cytotoxically degranulate human
eosinophil s2"

 

Strengths and limitations

Strengths of the present study include the use of a large cohort of
patients with CSU from 2 European centers. The CSU definition,
assessment of disease activity, and algorithm of treatment were
based on the international guideline.' The limitations of our study
are its retrospective, cross-sectional design, the univariate and
descriptive nature of the analyses performed, and the lack of a
control group. Causality cannot be established on the basis of the
data derived from this study. Some of the patients with CSU in this
study may have had diseases (eg, malignancy) that can cause eosinopenia and/or have been treated with cyclosporine or corticosteroids, which can influence eosinophil counts in the blood.’
However, no significant difference was seen in eosinophil counts
between patients treated with corticosteroids and patients who did
not receive corticosteroids at the time of blood sampling (P > .05).

 

 

CONCLUSIONS

Taken together, eosinopenia is prevalent in patients with
CSU, especially in female patients with type IIb aiCSU,
concomitant basopenia, autoimmune thyroid disease, and/or
high disease activity. We speculate that recruitment of eosinophils to the skin and/or immunologic destruction of eosinophils
in the blood are relevant mechanisms of eosinopenia in patients
with CSU. Future studies should test these hypotheses by
addressing the following questions: (1) Does eosinopenia reverse
with treatment or regression of urticarial lesions as basopenia
does? (2) Can omalizumab decrease the number of eosinophils in
CSU lesions? (3) Are there factors in the blood that can cause
depletion of blood eosinophils?

Our findings show that low blood eosinophil counts predict
poor response to treatment with sgAHs and omalizumab and
the combination of eosinopenia with basopenia may increase
the diagnostic value. Eosinophil count is a cost-effective and

easy-to-perform parameter approved by current urticaria
guidelines. It may help physicians to identify the right patients
for choosing the next step in the chronic urticaria algorithm.'
Further prospective and multicenter studies are needed to
confirm eosinophils as a biomarker in the management of
patients with CSU.
