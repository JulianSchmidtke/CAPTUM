well understood.
Objectives: To estimate C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-18, and cortisol levels in patients with CU
and to explore their association with disease severity and stress.
Methods: Forty-five patients with CU and 45 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited for this
cross-sectional study. Disease severity was assessed by the urticaria activity score (UAS) and stress by
Presumptive Stressful Life Events (PSLE) and Daily Hassles and Uplifts Scale—Revised (DHUS-R) scoring. IL-18
and high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) were estimated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits and
cortisol levels by chemiluminescence.
Results: We observed significant systemic inflammation (increased hs-CRP and IL-18 levels) and stress
scores, whereas there was a lowering of basal cortisol levels in patients with CU compared with controls.
This finding was more pronounced with increasing disease severity and autoimmune disease, except for
stress scores, which did not vary between patients with positive and negative autologous plasma skin test
results. We further observed that patients with CU with hypocortisolism had higher levels of hs-CRP and
IL-18 and higher PSLE and DHUS-R scores compared with those without hypocortisolism. The hs-CRP level,
IL-18 level, PSLE score, DHUS-R score, and duration of the symptoms are significantly positively correlated
with UAS, whereas the cortisol level is significantly negatively correlated with UAS. Cortisol has a significant
negative correlation with PSLE score, DHUS-R score, and the duration of the disease.
Conclusion: CU is associated with systemic inflammation and stress, along with a significant lower basal
cortisol, especially with severe disease and autoimmune urticaria. Thus, chronic stress may precipitate the
vicious cycle in the pathogenesis of CU.

In general, during acute stress, both the adrenocortical and
medullary systems are activated, leading to increased release of
cortisol and catecholamines. On the contrary, chronic stress causes
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis fatigue, resulting
in reduced cortisol secretion and leading to increased secretion of
inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-18, which
are typically counterregulated by cortisol.? Hence, we conducted
this study to explore the association of disease and stress severity
with markers of systemic inflammation and cortisol levels in
patients with CU.

Methods

This cross-sectional study was performed in 45 patients with CU
attending the Department of Dermatology, Jawaharlal Institute of
Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, and 45 age- and
sex-matched healthy controls conforming to the inclusion and
exclusion criteria after obtaining written informed consent from the
study participants. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institute
Ethics Committee (Human Studies), and written informed consent
was obtained from all study participants before their participation in
the study. This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical
guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 1983.

Sample Size Calculation

Sample size was estimated from serum _ high-sensitivity
C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) values with an expected difference in
mean (SD) hs-CRP between the patients with CU and the healthy
controls as 1.94 (2.80) mg/L from our prior studies in CU.° To detect
this difference with 80% power at 5% level of significance, the
minimum sample size required for the study was estimated as 45 in
each group (cases and controls). This was calculated by using the
power and sample size calculator, version 3.0 (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee).

Study Population

Patients attending the Dermatology Clinic of our hospital who
were 18 to 50 years old and diagnosed as having CU, characterized
by the presence of continuous or recurrent hives with or without
angioedema for greater than 6 weeks’ duration (cases), and ageand sex-matched healthy controls constituted the study population. The exclusion criteria for cases and controls were any
medication for the past 3 months before recruitment (other than
antihistamine treatment, which had to be stopped for 1 week
before assessment of autologous plasma skin test [APST]), physical
urticaria, acute urticaria, pregnant women, endocrine disorders,
malignant tumors, hepatic and renal disease, and other inflammatory skin diseases.

Workup and Sample Collection

After recruitment in the study, clinical and anthropometric
parameters and existence of comorbidities and treatment details
were recorded in a predesigned pro forma. The entire work flow is
shown in Figure 1. In all patients with CU, the disease severity was
assessed by the urticaria activity score (UAS).’ Autoreactivity was
assessed by using the APST as part of the clinical workup by the
dermatologist (M.M.).° Presumptive Stressful Life Events (PSLE) and
Daily Hassles and Uplifts Scale—Revised (DHUS-R) scoring was used
to assess stress levels in study participants.?'° The scoring was
performed based on questionnaires filled out by the study participants. Blood samples were drawn, along with routine sampling
required for the workup of the patient, from the antecubital vein
after light application of a tourniquet. IL-18 and hs-CRP levels were
estimated using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits, and serum cortisol levels (8:00 am) were

estimated using chemiluminescence. Adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH) stimulation testing was performed in participants who had
borderline cortisol levels (3—10 ug/dL).'' A total of 14 IU of injection
corticotropin (Acton Prolongatum; Ferring Pharmaceuticals, SaintPrex, Switzerland) was injected intramuscularly, and blood samples were collected again after 1 hour for estimation of cortisol.
Patients with basal cortisol levels below 3 mg/dL and poststimulation (1 hour) cortisol levels below 18 g/dL were identified
as having hypocortisolism."!

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software for Windows, version 20 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). Baseline
characteristics of cases and controls were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Categorical variables were expressed as percentages
and frequencies and assessed using the + or Fisher exact test. The
normality of continuous data was assessed by the KolmogrovSmirnov test. The data were described as mean (SD) or median
(interquartile range [IQR]), as appropriate. Comparison of the
various parameters between cases and controls was performed by
the independent sample t test for parametric data and the MannWhitney test for nonparametric data. The levels of the various
biochemical parameters were correlated with each other and with
the disease severity UAS, using Spearman correlation. To assess the
effects of confounders on the study parameters, a logistic regression analysis was performed with hypocortisolism as dependent
variable. Analysis was performed at 5% level of significance, and
P <.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

In this cross-sectional study, the serum levels of cortisol, hs-CRP,
and IL-18 and the PSLE and DHUS-R scores for stress were
compared for 45 patients with CU and 45 age- and sex-matched
controls. Baseline characteristics were comparable between cases
and controls (Table 1). Of 45 patients with CU, 33 (73.3%) tested

APST positive and 12 (26.7%) APST negative (Table 2). The median
UAS of CU patients in our study was 5.0 (IQR, 4.0—6.0), and the
median duration of the symptoms was 12.0 (IQR, 12.0—36.0)
months. Of the 45 cases, 26 (57.8%) were identified to have hypocortisolism (21 with baseline cortisol levels <3 wg/dL and 5 with
poststimulation values <18 yg/dL), whereas none of the controls
had hypocortisolism. Baseline cortisol levels (8:00 am) were
significantly lower in patients with CU when compared with that in
controls. The hs-CRP and IL-18 levels and the PSLE and DHUS-R
scores for stress were significantly higher in patients with CU
when compared with controls (Table 2).

The hs-CRP level (9 = 0.815, P < .001), IL-18 level (p = 0.636,
P < .0001), PSLE score (p = 0.362, P < .001), DHUS-R score (p =
0.321, P = 002), and duration of the symptoms (p = 0.877, P <.001)
were significantly positively correlated with UAS, whereas cortisol
(p = —0.746, P < .001) was significantly negatively correlated with
UAS. Cortisol had a significant negative correlation with duration of
symptoms (p = —0.599, P <.001), PSLE score (p = —0.343, P= .001),
and DHUS-R score (p = —0.231, P = .03). The patients with CU who
tested APST positive had more severe disease as observed by
elevated UASs in this group. Twenty-three (69.7%) of APST-positive
patients with CU were found to have hypocortisolism, whereas only
3 (25%) of the APST-negative patients with CU had hypocortisolism
(Table 3). The levels of hs-CRP and IL-18 were significantly more
elevated in patients with autoimmune urticaria compared with
patients without autoimmune urticaria. There was no significant

Patients with CU and hypocortisolism had longer duration and
higher severity of urticaria (Table 4). The levels of hs-CRP and IL-18
and the PSLE and DHUS-R stress scores were higher in patients with
CU and hypocortisolism compared with those without hypocortisolism (Table 4).

To assess the effects of confounders on the study parameters, a
univariate logistic regression analysis was performed, and APST
result, UAS, hs-CRP level, IL-18 level, and DHUS-R score were
identified as predictors of hypocortisolism in univariate analysis
(eTable 1). Because there was significant colinearity among the
variables, a stepwise logistic regression was performed, and UAS
and duration of the disease were identified as independent predictors of hypocortisolism in CU (Cragg-Uhler [Nagelkerke]
R? = 0.708, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of
the model = 0.94; eFig 1).

Discussion

Previous studies have proposed a role for psychological stress in
CU>!: in a 2-way interaction, wherein CU heightens psychological distress and chronic stress may be a trigger of CU.'* There is
evidence of the occurrence of stressful life events as precursors to
the onset of CU. In a previous case-control study by Yang et al’ on
patients with CU and the association between chronic idiopathic
urticaria and stress from major life events, the investigators
observed that patients with CU had significantly higher number of
stressful life events than controls in the 6 months before symptom
onset. Moreover, these patients had a significantly higher sum of
subjective weighting scores of event impact than controls. Fava
et al’ observed that patients with CU were exposed to significantly
more stressful life events in the 4 to 6 months before disease onset.
Ozkan et al,'* in their study to determine the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity and quality of life in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, observed 60% of patients to have a psychiatric
diagnosis, with most (40%) being diagnosed as having depressive
disorders followed by anxiety disorders (12%). In addition, most of
these patients (81%) believed that their illness was due to stress. In
our study, we also observed that the stress scores (PSLE and DHUS)
were significantly higher in cases than in controls and demonstrated a significant positive correlation with UAS, thus implicating
stressful life events in the pathogenesis of CU and disease
exacerbations.

The association with stress implicates the neuroendocrine
system in the etiology of CU (Fig 2). When exposed to early stages of
stress, temporary activation of the HPA axis occurs, resulting in
secretion of cortisol, down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines, and up-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines. In

addition, stress also results in secretion of IL-18, a pleiotropic
cytokine with immune modulatory and proinflammatory properties from the anterior pituitary and adrenals during activation of
the HPA axis. IL-18 acts as a modulator of the HPA axis along with
cortisol, setting up a negative feedback mechanism by inhibiting
corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) secretion.>"”

However, long-term exposure to stress enhances the central
tone of the HPA axis, resulting in HPA axis fatigue, which causes
hypocortisolism. In addition, there is a shift in the cytokine
milieu with increased production of proinflammatory cytokines,
such as IL-6 and IL-18. Owing to hypocortisolism-induced loss of
feedback control, there is increased secretion of CRH. Moreover,
the increased levels of IL-18 fail to exert its inhibitory effect on
CRH owing to HPA axis fatigue, thereby further increasing the
CRH production. In addition, recent human studies have reported
the existence of a peripheral HPA axis equivalent to the central
HPA axis in the skin, with the epidermal and hair follicle keratinocytes, sebocytes, and mast cells secreting CRH and expressing CRH-R1 receptors in response to stress. Keratinocytes also
secrete IL-18 during stress, inducing severe cutaneous inflammation. Thus, the skin HPA axis may have its own regulatory
feedback mechanism through interaction with inflammatory
cytokines.?!° Thus, all these mechanisms result in increased CRH
production.

CRH has been demonstrated to have proinflammatory properties by causing mast cell degranulation and increasing vascular
permeability in vivo in rat skin.'° CRH also causes increased IL-6
secretion. This CRH induced activation of skin mast cells via a
CRH-R1i—dependent mechanism leading to vasodilation and

increased vascular permeability has been implicated in the pathophysiology of skin disorders, such as atopic dermatitis, eczema,
psoriasis, and CU, which are exacerbated or precipitated by
stress.'°'” Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in skin
biopsy specimens of patients with CU has revealed expression of
high levels of CRH-R1 and mast cell—related gene histidine decarboxylase, thus implicating CRH-R in CU.'” These pathomechanisms
thus possibly implicate the role of stress in the etiopathogenesis
of CU.

In our study, we observed significantly lower levels of basal
cortisol in patients with CU when compared with controls. The
number of patients with hypocortisolism was significantly higher
among patients with CU compared with controls. Similarly, the
number of patients with hypocortisolism was significantly higher
in those with autoimmune urticaria. There was a significant negative correlation among urticaria severity, disease duration, stress
scores (PSLE and DHUS), and serum cortisol levels, thus supporting
the hypothesis that chronic stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of
hypocortisolism in CU. On the contrary, Dyke et al'' have reported
heightened basophil response to CRH and ACTH and higher levels
of serum cortisol in CU and failed to find any evidence of stress as a
major contributor to CU.

Prior studies have also reported lower levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) in patients with CU.'®'° The lowered
level of DHEA-S in CU was hypothesized to be due to a shift of the
biochemical pathway from mineralocorticoids and adrenal androgens toward glucocorticoids as a response to stress. The decrease in
DHEA-S levels correlated negatively with the level of anxiety and
depression.'*
R. Varghese et al. / Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol xxx (2016) 1—5 5

Overproduction of IL-18 in CU, especially in autoimmune urticaria correlating with disease severity, has been reported in
previous studies.*°?! Many studies have reported that markers of
systemic inflammation (CRP and IL-6) are significantly elevated in
patients with CU and correlate positively with disease severity.”
The chronic inflammation in CU associated with increased secretion of IL-6 and IL-18 from keratinocytes, especially in autoimmune
urticaria and chronic stress, owing to CU further set up a positive
feedback mechanism that contributes to the HPA axis fatigue,
thereby worsening the hypocortisolism.**** The decreased cortisol
levels are no longer able to regulate the inflammation, which flares
up, further potentiating the vicious cycle.???°

In our study, we also observed significantly higher levels of the
inflammatory markers hs-CRP and IL-18 in patients with CU
compared with controls, with more profound alterations in autoimmune urticaria compared with nonautoimmune urticaria.
Elevation in proinflammatory markers correlated positively with
UAS and negatively with cortisol levels.

Although we have observed the association of hypocortisolism
with urticaria activity score and disease duration, it is difficult to
comment on whether it is a cause or effect. This issue can only be
resolved in a prospective study of patients with urticaria of longer
than 6 weeks’ duration with longitudinal follow-up with serial
measurements of cortisol and inflammatory biomarkers. Another
important issue in the study was the high proportion of autoreactivity noted and the technique used to detect it. The proportion
of patients with autoreactivity has varied from 40% to 70%,
depending on the population studied.”” *° Although many studies
of late have used autologous serum skin testing (sensitivity is
believed to be higher, although specificities seem to be similar), we
used APST because a prior study performed in India found a higher
proportion of APST positive results compared with autologous
serum skin testing.”*~° In addition, although there was no significant difference in DHUS (which reflects acute stress) and PSLE
(which reflects chronic stress), patients with autoreactivity had
higher PSLE scores. The other limitations of the study include the
possibility of recall bias (prior use of glucocorticoids), referral bias
(tertiary care center), and small sample size.

In conclusion, CU is associated with significantly higher levels of
inflammatory markers (hs-CRP and IL-18) and stress scores in
conjunction with significantly lower basal cortisol levels, especially
with severe disease and autoimmune urticaria. This finding
suggests a role for glucocorticoids, glucocorticoids with SSRIs, or
SSRIs alone in the management of patients with CU, especially in
those with autoreactivity and severe disease.
