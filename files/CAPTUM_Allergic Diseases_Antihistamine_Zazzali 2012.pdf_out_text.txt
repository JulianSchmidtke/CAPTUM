comorbidities.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using insurance claims. We included patients with 1
outpatient claim with an International Classification of Diseases, 9‘" Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)
code for idiopathic, other specified, or unspecified urticaria (ICD-9-CM 708.1, 708.8, or 708.9) and either (1)
another of these claims 6 or more weeks later; (2) a claim for angioedema (ICD-9-CM 995.1) 6 or more weeks
from the urticaria diagnosis; or (3) overlapping claims for 2 prescription medications commonly used for CIU.
Results: We identified 6,019 patients who had claims consistent with CIU. The mean age was 36 years.
Fifty-six percent of patients had primary care physicians as their usual source of care, 14% had allergists, and
5% had dermatologists. Allergic rhinitis was diagnosed in 48%, asthma in 21%, other allergy in 19%, and atopic
dermatitis in 8%. Sixty-seven percent of patients used prescription antihistamines, 54% used oral corticosteroids (OCSs), 24% used montelukast, and 9% used oral doxepin. Antihistamine users received a mean of 152
days of prescription antihistamines, OCS users 30 days of OCSs, montelukast users 190 days of montelukast,
and oral doxepin users 94 days of doxepin.
Conclusions: Primary care physicians managed most patients with CIU. Antihistamines were the most
common treatment for CIU, although OCSs were frequently prescribed. Thirty days of OCS supply among
users may represent multiple steroid bursts each year. Given the known risks of OCSs, identifying other CIU
treatments with more favorable safety profiles may be beneficial.

Introduction toms, from localized urticaria to life-threatening angioedema, may be
treated by a variety of specialists. No consensus guidelines exist in the
United States (although a British guideline has been published),' and
treatment may vary widely across geographic regions.

The literature on CIU contains a variety of investigations of underlying biologic mechanisms and small studies of treatments, but the
epidemiology, treatment patterns, and burden of CIU have not been
well described. The primary objective of this study was to characterize
an insured population with CIU and, specifically, to describe these
patients’ demographic characteristics and common comorbidities and
to identify the types of physician specialists who cared for them. The
study also characterized the frequency of various treatments used for
CIU and calculated the cost of care for this condition.

Chronic urticaria is a frustrating condition for caregivers and
affected patients. Urticaria is not a single disease but a reaction
pattern that includes cutaneous mast cell degranulation and extravasation of plasma into the dermis. Urticaria is characterized by
hives or wheals. In many patients, an extensive workup does not
uncover a cause. Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is a diagnosis
that requires wheals and pruritus to be present for 6 or more weeks
with no obvious cause. The pathogenesis of this condition is not well
understood, but many patients appear to have underlying autoimmune abnormalities. Patients presenting with a spectrum of symp

commercial health care claims database. The data in the Ingenix
Lab/Rx database are derived from claims for inpatient admissions,
outpatient medical encounters, prescription drugs, and enrollment data on just over 10 million commercially insured individuals from every major region of the United States. Data on
over-the-counter (OTC) medications are not available. The study
was exempt from review by a human subjects protection committee because the database did not contain protected health
information.

The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical
Modification (ICD-9-CM) code 708 refers to urticaria. There is no
specific ICD-9-CM code for CIU; it may be coded as 708.1 (idiopathic), 708.8 (other specified), or 708.9 (unspecified). The study
included patients who were continuously enrolled from July 1,
2007 through June 30, 2008 and had at least 1 outpatient ICD-9-CM
code of 708.1, 708.8, or 708.9 combined with (1) asecond such code
6 or more weeks later; (2) an ICD-9-CM code of 995.1 for angioedema at least 6 weeks from the urticaria diagnosis; or (3) a90-day
or longer period of an overlapping supply of a prescription antihistamine and a second prescription medication commonly used
to treat CIU (a second antihistamine, montelukast, cyclosporine,
methotrexate, or oral corticosteroids [OCSs]). We did not include
the codes for allergic urticaria (708.0), urticaria attributable to
heat or cold (708.2), dermatographic urticaria (708.3), vibratory
urticaria (708.4), or cholinergic urticaria (708.5) in the algorithm
under the assumption, supported by the 2 authors who treat CIU
(M.W.C., D.J.H.), that these would not be used to code idiopathic
urticaria.

Variables

Patient demographic characteristics included age, sex, and geographic region; race/ethnicity was not reported in the database. We
categorized “usual-care” physician specialty and “urticaria-care”
physician specialty to describe the physicians who treated the
study subjects. These specialties were identified using a previously
validated method in which all evaluation and management service
claims are reviewed, and the specialty listed on the plurality of
these claims is defined as the usual-care specialty.* A similar
method, but only including visits at which urticaria was coded, was
used to identify the “urticaria-care” specialty. This was the specialty providing most of the evaluation and management services
related to urticaria. We used the Charlson index, a validated claimsbased measure of comorbidities, to characterize the burden of
comorbid conditions.* The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project
Chronic Condition Indicator was used to count chronic conditions.*° We identified several specific conditions that may be seen
in conjunction with CIU, including atopic dermatitis (ICD-9-CM:
691.8), vasculitis and allergic purpura (ICD-9-CM: 287.0), allergic
rhinitis (ICD-9-CM: 477.xx), asthma (ICD-9-CM: 493.xx), and other
allergy (ICD-9-CM: 995.3, V15.x).

Claims do not associate a diagnosis with prescriptions, and no
medications are specifically approved to treat CIU. To characterize treatment patterns, we identified 12 groups of prescription
medications often used to treat CIU. These groups included 2
categories of antihistamines: nonsedating (cetirizine HCl, desloratadine, fexofenadine HCl, levocetirizine dihydrochloride, and
loratadine) and all other prescription antihistamines (as noted,
the database did not contain information on OTC antihistamines). Additional medication categories were OCSs, oral doxepin, montelukast, cyclosporine, methotrexate, H2 blockers,
dapsone, sulfasalazine, and omalizumab.

We reported use of these drugs individually and in combination.
Total and ClU-related charges were also reported. Total health
service use included inpatient hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, and physician office visits for all diagnoses during
the 1-year period. Charges related to CIU included inpatient claims

with a primary diagnosis of urticaria and outpatient claims with a
primary or secondary diagnosis of urticaria. Urticaria-related pharmacy costs included any of the 12 groups of prescription medications used to treat CIU.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics were reported for all measures. All data
transformations and statistical analyses were performed using SAS
version 9.2 (Cary, North Carolina). Means and standard deviations
were reported for continuous variables; counts and percentages for
categorical variables.

Results

A total of 7,555,991 individuals in the database met the 1-year
continuous enrollment criteria, and 79,672 had at least 1 claim
consistent with urticaria. Of these, 6,019 met the inclusion criteria,
a prevalence rate of 1 per 1,255 (0.08%) enrollees. Having a second
urticaria claim 6 or more weeks later was the most common reason
or inclusion (n = 4,950), followed by an angioedema diagnosis 6 or
more weeks distant from the urticaria claim (n = 1,255) and overlapping fills for prescription medications used to treat CIU (n =
1,008); 1,194 met more than one criteria.

The mean age of the 6,019 patients in the final study cohort was
36.0 years, and 66.7% (4,013) were female. The study population
ad a median of 2 chronic conditions identified in their claims and
a median Charlson comorbidity index of 0, indicating relatively few
serious concomitant conditions. Forty-eight percent of the group
ad allergic rhinitis, 21.2% had asthma, and 18.5% had other allergies in their claims. Atopic dermatitis affected 7.8%, and 0.3% were
affected by vasculitis or allergic purpura. Anxiety and depression
also were common, with both being identified in 9.4% of the popuation (Table 1).

Primary care (internal and family medicine) was the specialty of
the usual-care physician for most (56.4%) of the patients, followed
by allergy/immunology (13.9% of patients) and dermatology (5.4%).
For 24.3%, the specialty of the usual-care physician was either
unknown (3.8%) or was one of a variety of other specialties (20.5%),
each constituting 2% or less of the total. In contrast, the specialty
providing the most urticaria care was allergy/immunology in 42.7%
of cases, primary care in 33.0%, dermatology in 13.3%, and other or
unknown in 11.0% (Table 2).

Ten patterns described the use of prescription medications by
82% of the subjects; no data were available on OTC antihistamines. The most common pattern, seen in 16.8% of patients, was
the combination of a prescription nonsedating antihistamine
with at least 1 course of OCSs. Prescription nonsedating antihis

the only prescription medication used in 11.6% of patients. Prescription nonsedating antihistamines plus montelukast, with
(8.7%) and without (6.3%) OCSs, were the next most common
patterns. Fifteen and a half percent of patients filled none of the
12 categories of prescription medications during the study year
(Table 3).

Prescription antihistamines were used by 66.6% of the study
group, with 64.0% using prescription nonsedating antihistamines
and 7.9% using sedating prescription ones. Oral corticosteroids
were the next most common medication (53.7% of patients), followed by montelukast (24.1%). Nine percent used oral doxepin, and
6.7% used H2 blockers. Less-common medications included cyclosporine (1.1% of patients) and methotrexate (0.7%). Of medications
used by more than 1% of patients, montelukast had the greatest
mean days supplied (190 days), followed by prescription antihistamines (152 days), oral doxepin (which is also a highly potent antihistamine; 94 days), H2 blockers (89 days), and OCS (30 days)
(Table 4). Considering doxepin to be an antihistamine would raise
the proportion treated with a prescription antihistamine to 68.1%,
and considering H2 blockers as antihistamines would raise it to
69.5% (not shown).

Patients with CIU were frequent users of office-based care, with
amedian of 11 visits per year (mean + SD, 14.5 + 12.6). A median of
2 visits (mean + SD, 3.1 + 2.8) was urticaria related. Few CIU
patients were hospitalized (mean + SD, 0.4 + 2.3) or went to the ED
(mean + SD, 0.5 = 3.0 visits) during the year. During the year of
observation, 9.5% of patients had a skin biopsy, and 16.8% had a test
for antithyroid antibodies. The mean total annual charge for all
health care per patient was $15,848 (median, $7,041), of which
$1,762 (median, $1,298) was urticaria related. Medical claims
(which do not include charges for prescription drugs) accounted for

most of the charges, with a mean of $13,426 (median, $5,135) total
and $1,252 (median, $700) for urticaria-related care. Prescription
charges for urticaria-related medications were $510 (median,
$243) (Table 5).

We conducted 2 sensitivity analyses. In the first we examined
the extent to which our results reflected the single year in which
we conducted the analysis. We compared the demographic characteristics of our study population with the characteristics of a
population drawn from a study time frame exactly 1 year earlier.
Mean age differed by less than 1 year, and the proportion of
females was identical. The proportion cared for by each of the
listed physician specialties differed by less than 1 percentage
point.

To determine the extent to which our algorithms for identifying patients with CIU impacted our findings, we looked separately at all outcomes for patients meeting different inclusion
criteria. For patients meeting the 3 different sets of inclusion
criteria, the median number of office visits was 11 for those with
2 diagnoses of ICD-9-CM 708.1, 708.8, or 708.9 at least 6 weeks
apart and for those with 1 diagnosis and angioedema, whereas
patients who qualified by having 1 diagnosis and 2 prescription
medications had a median of 13 visits. Urticaria-related visits
varied from a median of 1 in the group with 2 prescription
medications to 3 in both other groups. Total charges varied from

Discussion

In this claims-based study, we identified a group of patients apt
to have CIU, we described their common comorbidities, and we
characterized their patterns of health service use. Just over 6,000
patients out of 7.5 million met our criteria, giving an estimated
prevalence of 0.08%. Patients meeting our criteria had a mean age
of 36 years, and two-thirds were female. Allergic rhinitis,
asthma, and other allergies were common in our sample, as were
anxiety and depression. Allergists were the most common provider of urticaria care, followed by primary care physicians and
dermatologists. Most patients used both prescription nonsedating antihistamines and OCSs. Study patients were frequent users
of outpatient care and prescription medications beyond those
used for CIU, despite their relatively young age and lack of other
chronic illnesses. Their total annual charges were $15,848, with
$1,762 directly related to urticaria. Medications to treat urticaria
cost $510/year on average.

Our findings are generally consistent with prior research. Because of the variability in diagnosis, the prevalence of CIU has been
difficult to establish. Published lifetime prevalence figures of 0.1%
to 0.5% and a typical disease duration of 4 to 5 years are consistent
with our 1-year period prevalence estimate of 0.08%.°” A US study
of 50 nonimmunosuppressed patients with CIU reported a mean
age of 43 years, with 74% female.® A study of 139 patients with
chronic urticaria in Israel reported a mean age of 41 years, with 63%
female,° whereas a Turkish study of 953 patients reported a mean
age of 37 years with 68% female.'° Our study identified patients
with evidence of atopy in somewhat higher numbers than has been
reported. 10 One element of the patient identification algorithm
involved the use of antihistamines, which may have led to the
inclusion of patients who took these agents for atopic conditions
rather than for CIU. We found no prior research on the distribution
of specialists caring for patients with CIU, but several other studies
used populations of patients in specialty care rather than all insured patients.

DeLong and colleagues® studied the medical records of 50 patients attending allergy and dermatology clinics and reported on
treatment patterns and cost. In that study, 72% used nonsedating
antihistamines and 28% used OCSs, compared with our estimates of
64% and 54%, respectively. These investigators found that 8% used
no medications in the preceding study (compared with 15.5% in our
study) and that 46% used sedating antihistamines (compared with
8% in our study).

Several potential explanations exist for these differences. The
dramatically higher rate of OCS use in our study may be explained by our inclusion of patients who received most of their
care from primary care physicians in community practice rather
than specialists in an academic setting. Furthermore, insurance
claims do not link prescriptions with diagnoses, so some of the
OCS prescriptions we identified may have been for conditions
other than CIU.

Over-the-counter treatments were not available in our claims
dataset because they are not reimbursed by insurance, leaving
no record in claims to be analyzed. Combined with the wide
availability of OTC antihistamines, this is a significant confounder and likely explains the lower rate of antihistamine use
in this study compared with others. We were unable to address
this problem within the confines of the dataset, and privacy rules
made it impossible for us to contact the individuals we studied to
ascertain their OTC antihistamine use. Although surveys and
reviews of medical records are likely to be more reliable than
studies of health insurance claims to estimate the proportion of

 

patients using antihistamines overall, our estimate of prescription antihistamine use should be reliable.

Using 2005 prices, DeLong and colleagues calculated mean direct costs of care for CIU at $2,047 annually.* We reported a mean
total annual urticaria-related charge of $1,762 using care between
2007 and 2008. De Long also reported medication costs using average wholesale prices and found a mean annual direct cost of
$1,280° compared with our mean total annual medication cost of
$510. The database we used reports actual charges, and our lower
estimates of cost for medical care and for prescription drugs may be
explained by the tendency of the average wholesale price to overestimate actual costs.'! Adjusting for the 10% rise in the consumer
price index from 2005 to 2008, the differences between the two
studies would be slightly larger.

Managing CIU is a complex and difficult task. Although searching for and removing potential inciting factors may be the best first
step, such a search is often fruitless. Symptomatic, nonpharmacologic measures also may be useful for some patients. Experts have
recommended that initial pharmacologic therapy begin with
oral antihistamines in the nonsedating category with the addition of a second antihistamine, either sedating or nonsedating, if
an inadequate response results.'* Our study suggests that this
initial recommendation is commonly followed. Experts also suggest H2 blockers and “steroid-sparing” treatments, including
leukotriene receptor antagonists, as further treatment. Our
study suggests that patients are more commonly treated with
OCSs than with corticosteroid-sparing drugs (eg, leukotriene
receptor antagonists).

The most serious limitation of this study was our inability to
confirm the diagnosis of CIU by review of medical records. In the
absence of medical record confirmation, and lacking an ICD-9-CM
code specifically for CIU, we were forced to use a variety of algorithms to identify likely CIU patients. Although these algorithms
likely included some patients who did not have CIU and excluded
others who did, our observed prevalence was consistent with published prevalence estimates. In a sensitivity analysis examining the
impact of using different algorithms to identify patients, we did
find variability, although the direction and magnitude of outcomes
were similar across all groups.

A confirmatory analysis of the medical records of patients
whose claims we analyzed would be the best way to test the
sensitivity and specificity of our algorithm, but such an analysis was
beyond the scope of the current project. Even if our algorithm were
accurate, claims are generated for billing purposes, not for research,
and consequently they lack important clinical details, including
laboratory or allergen test results, use of OTC medications, and
information on the study subjects’ environment and behavior. Finally, claims are subject to errors such as under- or overcoding of
conditions.

This large population-based study of commercially insured
individual confirms prior estimates of the approximate proportion of the population diagnosed with CIU. The study suggests
that many such patients are managed by primary care physicians
and that although antihistamines are the most common pharmacologic treatment, use of OCSs is quite common. Although patients with CIU are relatively young and otherwise healthy, their
health care charges are substantial, with approximately $1,700
per year related directly to care and treatment of urticaria.
