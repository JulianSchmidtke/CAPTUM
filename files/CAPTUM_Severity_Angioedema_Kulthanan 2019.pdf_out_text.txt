The Angioedema Activity Score (AAS) is recommended by the EAACI/GA*LEN/EDF/WAO guidelines for urticaria as the
standard measure for assessing disease activity in patients with recurrent angioedema (RAE). To date, it has been translated into 80
languages for use in 52 countries, but it has not been formally validated in Asian patient populations. As RAE may be different in
Asian and non-Asian patients, it is important to validate and characterize the reliability of tools to assess RAE disease activity in
Asian patients. This study proposed to demonstrate the validity and reliability of the AAS in Asian patients. Accordingly, this
study aimed to generate and validate the Thai version of the AAS and to characterize its reliability in Asian patients, specifically in
Thailand. A structured translation was conducted with approval from the original authors. The Patient Global Assessment of
Disease Activity (PGA-DA) was used as an instrument to compare with the Thai version of the AAS. In total, 86 patients with RAE
participated in the study. Seventy-six (88%) patients had RAE with chronic spontaneous urticaria. The Thai AAS was found to bea
valid and reliable instrument, with high convergent and known-groups validities, excellent internal consistency, and good testretest reliability. The validity and reliability of the AAS for assessing RAE disease activity in Asian patients have been demonstrated
by our study, making it the first to do so. This will help promote the use of the AAS, in clinical trials and practice, in Asia. It will also
facilitate the comparison of disease activity in patients with RAE inside and outside Asia in future studies. However, a limitation of
this study was its small number of patients.

1. Introduction

Recurrent angioedema (RAE) is characterized by the repeated occurrence of nonpitting, skin-colored, or sometimes
erythematous swellings of the skin or mucosa, often in the
face [1, 2]. Having a valid and reliable patient-reported
outcome (PRO) instrument to assess disease activity is
important to manage RAE effectively [3]. The Angioedema
Activity Score (AAS), which was developed in 2013 in
German, is the first PRO measure to assess disease activity in
patients with RAE [4]. The EAACI/GA?LEN/EDE/WAO
guidelines for urticaria recommend the AAS as the standard
measurement to assess and monitor the disease activity of

patients with RAE [5]. It consists of 5 questions with 4
answer options (scored 0-3) for each item, with a minimum
score of 0 and a maximum score of 15 per day. Lower scores
and higher scores represent low and high disease activity,
respectively. The AAS7, AAS28, and AAS84 are the AASs
that describe the disease activity of 7, 28, and 84 consecutive
days, respectively [4, 6].

The AAS has been translated and culturally adapted to 80
languages for use in 52 countries [6]. However, it has not yet
been formally validated in Asian patients with RAE. As RAE
may be different in Asian and non-Asian patients, it is
important to validate and characterize the reliability of tools
to assess RAE disease activity in Asian patients. Accordingly,
this study aimed to generate and validate the Thai version of
the AAS and to characterize its reliability in Asian patients,
specifically in Thailand.

2. Materials and Methods

The Thai version of the Angioedema Activity Score, the AAS,
was generated following standard protocols as previously
described [7]. In brief, the original AAS was first translated
independently by two native Thai-speaking healthcare
professionals and reviewed by two additional medical experts. A preliminary consensus Thai version was then
backtranslated into German, and this version and the
original were compared for discrepancies. Finally, a consensus version was created in collaboration with the authors
of the original AAS [4]. All AAS items were easily translated,
and the Thai AAS was successfully tested for clarity and
comprehension in 10 adult RAE patients.

In total, 86 adult patients with RAE who attended the
Allergy Clinic/Urticaria Center of Reference and Excellence
[8] of the Department of Dermatology, Siriraj Hospital, were
included. Exclusion criteria were a lack of literacy skills and/
or other concomitant dermatological or mental diseases. The
Thai AAS28 values were compared to results obtained from
the Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PGADA). The PGA-DA is a self-administered questionnaire that
contains one question to assess patient disease activity
during a 28-day period. The following 5-point scale is used:
0=absence, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, and 4= very
severe disease activity [9].

At baseline, informed consent was obtained, and the
patients were informed about how to complete the Thai AAS
and the PGA-DA. After the patients confirmed that they
understood how to complete the questionnaires, they were
asked to complete the AAS questionnaire for 28 consecutive
days by themselves before their second visit. After 4 weeks, the
AAS28 was collected and the patients were asked to complete
the PGA-DA by themselves. A new AAS28 was then given to
each patient to record the disease activity before the third visit.
After an additional four weeks, the AAS28 was collected and
the PGA-DA was once again completed by the patients.

 

 

2.1. Validity

(i) Convergent validity measures the relation of the Thai
AAS with other standard instruments. The correlation between the Thai AAS and the PGA-DA was
determined by Spearman’s correlation coefficient.
Weak, moderate, and strong correlation was demonstrated as correlation coefficient values of <0.3,
0.3-0.6, and >0.6, respectively [4, 10].

(ii) Known-group validity measures the capacity of the
AAS to discriminate across groups that are supposed
to differ. Using the PGA-DA scores, patients were
classified into five groups in this study: (i) “none”
(score of 0), (ii) “mild severity” (score of 1), (iii)
“moderate severity” (score of 2), (iv) “large severity”
(score of 3), and (v) “very large severity” (score of 4).

BioMed Research International

The Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to investigate
known-group validity [4, 10].

2.2. Reliability

(i) Internal consistency measures the uniformity of AAS
items which can indicate whether it is appropriate to
calculate a total score. Cronbach’s « reliability coefficient was used to analyze internal consistency that
a values of >0.9, 0.7 < a< 0.9, and 0.6< a< 0.7 were
regarded to indicate excellent, good, and acceptable
reliability, respectively [4, 11].

(ii) Test-retest reliability measures the consistency of the
AAS across multiple administrations. Stable patients
who have no change in PGA-DA during 4 weeks
should demonstrate comparable AASs between two
different visits. Intraclass correlation coefficient
(ICC) values of <0.40, 0.4-0.75, and >0.75 are evidence of poor, average, and strong reliability, respectively [4, 11].

This study was approved by the Siriraj Institutional
Review Board, Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital (SI 271/
2017). SPSS for Windows, Version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL, USA), was used to analyze data. p values <0.05 were
considered to indicate statistical significance.

3. Results

Of the 86 patients, 76 (88%) had RAE with concomitant
wheals, while the remaining 10 (12%) had RAE only. Demographic data are detailed in Table 1. The convergent
validity of the Thai AAS28, i.e., the correlation with the
PGA-DA, was strong (Spearman’s correlation coefficient
r=0.63; p< 0.0001). Using the PGA-DA scores, we then
classified patients, in terms of their disease activity, into five
groups: (i) “absence,” (ii) “mild,” (iii) “moderate,” (iv)
“severe,” and (v) “very severe.” This was done to assess the
known-group validity of the AAS28, in other words, its
ability to discriminate between groups that are different. As
determined by the use of the Kruskal-Wallis test, the Thai
AAS28 reliably discriminated between patients with low,
moderate, and high disease activity (p < 0.0001; Figure 1).

Internal consistency measures the uniformity of the items
of a PRO measure and indicates whether it is appropriate to
calculate a total score. To determine the internal consistency
of the Thai AAS, we used Cronbach’s « coefficient, for which a
values of >0.9, 0.7 < a< 0.9, and 0.6 < a < 0.7 were regarded as
indicating excellent, good, and acceptable consistency, respectively. Cronbach’s « value of the Thai AAS was 0.97,
which indicates excellent internal consistency.

Additionally, we determined the test-retest reliability of
the Thai AAS, i.e., its consistency across multiple administrations. Stable patients who have no change in PGA-DA
during 4 weeks should demonstrate comparable AASs at two
different visits. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values
of <0.40, 0.4-0.75, and >0.75 are evidence of poor, average,
and strong reliability, respectively. In the current study, 44
patients had no change in their PGA-DA scores between the

which indicates average test-retest reliability.

4. Discussion

In order to improve the treatment of AE patients, all of the
disease severity and impact on HRQoL in each patient need to
be recognized by physicians. However, the validated patient
report outcome instrument to determine disease severity in
AE patients is very small in number. In 2013, the AAS was
established by Weller et al. to be a specific tool to measure
disease severity in AE patients [4]. As the AAS is easy to use in
clinical practice, its application is recommended by the
EAACI/GA’LEN/EDF/WAO guidelines for the management
of urticaria [5]. The AAS has been designed in such a way that
it is convenient to complete and its score is easy to interpret.
Moreover, an advantage of the AAS is that it is independent of
any previous presentations, making it suitable for application
in the event of fluctuating attacks of AE.

Our study demonstrated strong convergent and knowngroup validities. It illustrated that the higher the AAS is, the
more severe the AE is in each patient. Moreover, the knowngroup validity of the AAS showed a statistically significant
difference for each PGA-DA group. This confirms that the
AAS is a valid instrument to evaluate disease severity for
Asian patients with AE. Moreover, the reproducibility of the
AAS was exhibited by excellent internal consistency and
good test-retest reliability.

Our study has limitations, namely, the relatively small
number of patients and types of RAE investigated and the restricted range of AAS28 values in our patients. As for the latter,
we only obtained values between 0 and 228 (mean: 22.0 + 42.5),
even though the full range of the AAS28 is from 0 to 420.
Similarly, in a recent study, RAE activity assessed by the AAS7
(the use of the AAS for one week) showed a mean value of 23
even though the AAS7 ranges from 0 to 105 [12]. This is because
the maximum values of 105 for the AAS7 and 420 for the AAS28
are “theoretical values.” To have a value of 420 in the AAS28, a
patient would have to have severe angioedema attacks 24 hours a
day for 28 days straight. Nevertheless, this study found the
AAS28 to be a valid and reliable tool for measuring RAE activity
in both Western and Asian patients.

 

 

5. Conclusions

In conclusion, this study is the first to demonstrate the
validity and reliability of the AAS28 in Asian patients with
RAE. This will help promote the use of the AAS, in clinical
trials and practice, in Asia. It will also facilitate the comparison of disease activity in patients with RAE inside and
outside Asia in future studies.
