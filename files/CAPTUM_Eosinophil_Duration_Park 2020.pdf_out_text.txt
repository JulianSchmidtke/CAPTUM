Abstract

Background: We aimed to investigate the treatment response and associated factors for loss of

control in children with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU).

Methods: A total of 240 CSU patients (aged 0-17 years) were enrolled in a single-center study in
Korea from May 2014 to May 2019. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and
compared the duration of treatment and step of medications using the urticaria control test (UCT,
range 0-16 points). Serum total immunoglobulin levels, eosinophil count, allergic sensitization,
autologous serum skin test, antinuclear antibody, thyroid function test, erythrocyte sedimentation
rate, and C-reactive protein were measured. The patients were divided into well-controlled
(sustained UCT = 12), partly controlled (fluctuating UCT around 12), and poorly controlled
(sustained UCT < 12) groups.

Results: Of the 240 children, 150 (62.5%) achieved well-controlled status; 74 (30.8%), partly
controlled; and 16 (6.7%), poorly controlled. Longer duration (adjusted odds ratio: 1.09, 95%
confidence interval: 1.05—1.13, P < 0.001) and higher treatment steps (5.61, 2.82—11.14, P <
0.001) for reaching the initial 12 points or more of UCT score, initial urticaria activity score
(UAS) score (1.06, 1.03—1.09, P < 0.001), and food sensitization (1.88, 1.03—3.46, P = 0.041)
were associated with inadequate treatment response. The mean duration to symptom free for |
month without medication were 14.6 months in the well-controlled group and 22.1 months in the

partly controlled group (P = 0.002).

Conclusion: Children with CSU have a good treatment response. Longer duration and higher
treatment step until the initial disease control, higher initial UAS7 score, and food sensitization

can predict inadequate treatment response.

Introduction

Chronic urticaria (CU) is defined as urticaria accompanied by wheal and itching lasting for at
least 6 weeks. A study from the Korean Health Insurance database reported that the annual
prevalence of CU in Korea was 2.64%-3.52%. The prevalence of chronic spontaneous urticaria
(CSU) reached 1.13~1.67%, which accounts for 42.9-47.5% of all cases of CU.! In children, a
previous Korean study reported a prevalence of 0.7%, while an Italian study reported a prevalence
of 0.38%-0.84%,23 which was lower than that in adults. The natural course of CSU in children is
generally favorable. About 10%-32% of patients showed remission at | year from disease onset,
31%-54% at 3 years, and 38%-72% at 5 years.+© Since the CSU characteristics differ between

pediatric and adult patients,’* application of the results of adult studies among children is limited.

Several studies have evaluated the factors associated with the characteristics of CU, control
status, and remission in children. Children with CU have a higher prevalence of allergic disease?
and allergic sensitization! than healthy children. A history of atopic dermatitis is a risk factor for
subsequent CSU.!! However, the association between CU remission and allergic diseases or
sensitization remains controversial.® CSU generally persists for more than 3 to 5 years, and most
patients show good response to medications. Nevertheless, not all patients with CU are able to
maintain their well-controlled status during the follow-up, and pediatric patients may show
12,13

emotional and behavioral impairments, which have a negative impact on their quality of life.

Therefore, it is crucial to determine the associated factors for loss of control.

Some instruments, including urticaria activity score (UAS), urticaria control test (UCT), and
CU quality of life (CU-QOL) score, have been validated for the measurement of severity, disease
control, and QOL in CU.®!4!> Although UAS7 has been validated for CU patients of all ages*!°,
UCT has only been validated in adults.!”!8 In children, only a few studies have investigated the
factors associated with disease control status. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the
clinical features according to CU control status and to identify the factors associated with loss of

CU control.

Methods

Participants

A total of 524 patients aged below 19 years were diagnosed with CU at Seoul National
University Bundang Hospital from May 2014 to May 2019. CSU was defined as spontaneous
urticaria lasting for more than six weeks. We included patients who underwent UCT at least twice.

A total of 240 patients were included in our study. (figure 1)

Children with chronic inducible urticaria (CIU) only, children without medication or with
medication only as needed from the first visit, and children whose level of CU control cannot be

determined due to incomplete check for UCT scores were excluded.

Patients’ medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic and clinical data,
including age at onset, sex, history of allergic disease (asthma or recurrent wheezers, allergic
rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and food allergy), familial history of allergic disease, duration of
urticaria, medication step, and duration of CU, were collected. After the initial visit, we evaluated
the CU control for 2 or 3 weeks. And then if they were well-controlled status, follow-up duration
was 2 or 3 months, but if not, follow-up duration was 2 or 4 weeks. Whenever possible, UCT and

UAS7 scores were assessed for each visit.

Assessment of disease activity and control

The disease activity in CSU patients was assessed by obtaining the UAS7 score. The UAS7
measures both pruritus (0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; and 3, intense) and the number of wheals (0,
none; 1, mild [<20 wheals/24 h]; 2, moderate [20-50 wheals/24 h]; 3, intense (>50 wheals/24 h or
large confluent areas of wheals]). The patients’ scores over a 24-hour period for 7 consecutive
days were summed to yield a possible total score ranging from 0 to 42. Then, the UAS7 scores
were used to categorize the severity of CSU in five steps (0, urticaria free; 1-6, well controlled; 7—

15, mild; 16-27, moderate; and 28-42, severe).°!4!9

UCT, a simple four-item instrument, is used to determine patients’ disease status. Each question
is ranked from 0 to 4 on the basis of severity, with a total possible score of 16. The cut-off value

for a well-controlled disease was 12 points.!+!7.!8

1. How much have you suffered from the physical symptoms of urticaria (itch, hives (welts),

and/or swelling) in the last four weeks?
2. How much was your QOL affected by the urticaria in the last four weeks?

3. How often was the treatment for your urticaria in the last four weeks not enough to control

your urticaria symptoms?
4. Overall, how well have you had your urticaria under control in the last four weeks?

The 12-point UCT scale was used to categorize the level of urticaria control as well-controlled
(sustained UCT = 12), partly controlled (fluctuating UCT around 12), or poorly controlled
(sustained UCT < 12). The CU control status was evaluated by assessing serial UCT scores. If the
patient gained <12 points only once during follow-up when the medication step was down, he or

she was considered to have a well-controlled status.

Laboratory tests

Blood tests were performed to measure the total eosinophil count, serum total immunoglobulin E
(IgE), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level, liver function
test (aspartate transaminase and alanine aminotransferase), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH),

free thyroxine (T4), and antinuclear antibody (ANA).

Allergic sensitization was assessed by multiple allergen screening tests (MAST) (R-Biopharm,
Darmstadt, Germany) in children requiring continuous medication or skin prick tests
(Allergopharma, Reinbek, Germany) for common allergens in those with a tolerable state of
urticaria. Sensitization was defined as at least one positive MAST result, an allergen-induced
wheal diameter of >3 mm and > positive control (histamine 1 mg/ml) in SPTs. Types and number
of allergen for MAST and SPT were described in online supplement material. An autologous
serum skin test (ASST) was performed in children older than 5 years, according to the European
Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) and Global Allergy and Asthma
European Network task force consensus report.?° A positive result was defined as a serum-induced

wheal diameter of at least 1.5 mm after 30 minutes, which is greater than that induced by saline.

Treatment

The medication to control CU was used according to the CU guidelines suggested by the
EAACI/World Allergy Organization'*; the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &
Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology?!; and the Korean Academy
of Allergy, Asthma, and Clinical Immunology.” If the patients failed to respond to a standard dose
of second-generation non-sedating H1-antihistamine (24 AH), the dose of the 2" AH was
increased 2-4 times, or the combined use of other medications, such as leukotriene receptor
antagonist (LTRA), first-generation antihistamines, or H2-antagonist, was considered. In patients
with severe CU exacerbation or severe urticaria, short-term treatment (3-7 days) of oral

corticosteroid was indicated. (Supplement figure 1)

Statistical analyses

Continuous variables were expressed as means and standard deviations (SDs), while the
prevalence was expressed as percentage. Analysis of variance and Student’s t-test were used for
between-group comparisons of continuous variables. Mann-Whitney U test was used in the
comparison of total IgE that showed non-parametric distribution. Categorical variables were
compared using the Pearson’s chi-square test. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression

analyses were used to identify the risk factors for non-well-controlled urticaria. The multivariate

regression test was adjusted for age, sex, allergy history, family history of allergic diseases, and
total IgE levels. Results from logistic regression analyses were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) and

95% confidence intervals (CIs).

A P-value of <0.05 was considered significant. All analyses were performed using SPSS for
Windows version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).

Ethical Approval

This study was approved by the institutional review board of Seoul National University Bundang
Hospital (B-1909/567-109). This study was retrospective, proceeded on waiver of informed

Results
Demographic characteristics of each controlled group

The mean age of 463 patients with CU was 6.8 years at the initial visit, and 51.6% were men. A
total of 318 (68.7%) patients were diagnosed with CSU only (mean age of 6.49 years), while 145
were diagnosed with both CSU and CIU (median age, 7.40 years) (Online Supplement Table).

According to the level of CSU control, 150 (62.5%) patients had a well-controlled status, 74
(30.8%) had a partly controlled status, and 16 (6.7%) had a poorly controlled status. No significant
differences were observed in the level of CSU control by age or sex (P = 0.436 and P = 0.565,

respectively).

Approximately 34.1% (82/240) of the patients showed symptom free for | month without
medication during the follow-up period, 63 (42.0%) had a well-controlled status, and 19 (25.7%)
had a partly controlled status. The mean duration to symptom free for 1 month without
medication was longer in the partly controlled group (22.1 months) than in the well-controlled
group (14.6 months) (P = 0.002).

No difference was observed in the history of allergic diseases (asthma, AR, and AD) among the
different control groups, even though it was slightly higher in the non-well-controlled group.
(57.8% vs. 47.3%, P = 0.231). For the first-step medication, 79.3% in the well-controlled group,
66.2% in the partly controlled group, and 50% in the poorly controlled group showed good
treatment response (P = 0.010). There was no difference in the sensitization rate between groups.
However, patients in the well-controlled group had lower sensitization rates to foods than those in
other groups. A usual dose of 2™¢ AH for initial treatment was used in 80.0% of well-controlled,

70.3% of the partly controlled, and 53.3% of the poorly controlled group (P = 0.018) (Table 1).

Disease severity and duration of and medications for initial disease control

The mean UAS7 scores at the first visit were 12.53, 17.20, and 21.1 points in the well, partly,
and poorly controlled groups, respectively (P < 0.001). The severity of UAS7 in each group is
shown in Supplement figure 2. The mean UCT scores at the first visit were 8.01, 7.05, and 5.93
points in the well, partly, and poorly controlled groups, respectively (P = 0.023). The well
controlled group and the partly controlled group achieved 12 points in the UCT within a mean

duration of 7.57 weeks and 13.41 weeks, respectively. Approximately 87.1% of the patients from
the well-controlled group and 61.4% from the partly controlled group achieved 12 points within
3 months (Supplement figure 3-A).

At 12 points of UCT, 68.9% of the patients from the well-controlled group used a usual dose of
24 AH, while the rest used higher doses of 2"! AH (3.4%), the usual dose of 24 AH with other
medications (12.8%), or a higher dose of 2"4 AH with other medications (14.9%). In the partly
controlled group, the usual dose of 2"! AH (34.3%), increased dose of 2"! AH (4.3%), the usual
dose of 2" AH with other medications (21.4%), or increased dose of 2" AH with other

medications was used (Supplement figure 3-B).

Factors associated with not-well-controlled urticaria

To evaluate the factors associated with CSU control, we re-categorized the patients into wellcontrolled and not-well-controlled groups (partly and poorly controlled groups). Univariate
logistic regression showed the results in terms of the initial UAS7 score (1.06; 1.03-1.09; P <
0.001), duration (1.09; 1.05—1.13; P < 0.001) and medication (4.74; 2.55-8.82; P < 0.001) until
the initial disease control (reaching 12 or more UCT score) and food sensitization (1.95; 1.14—
3.32; P = 0.014), initial UCT score (0.89; 0.80—0.98; P = 0.015), and response to the first-step
medication. (0.45; 2.55—-8.82; P < 0.001)

Similarly, the results of multivariate logistic regression showed that a higher initial UAS7 score
(OR, 1.06; 95% CI: 1.03-1.09; P < 0.001), longer duration (1.09; 1.05—1.13; P < 0.001) and
higher medication step (5.61; 2.82—11.14; P < 0.001) until initial the disease control, and food
sensitization (1.88; 1.03—3.46; P = 0.041) were the risk factors for a not-well-controlled CSU.
Higher initial UCT score (0.87; 0.79-0.97; P = 0.008) and treatment response for the first-step
medication (0.42; 0.23—-0.79; P = 0.007) were favorable factors for controlling CSU.

There was no difference in CU control according to age, sex, allergic history, family history of
allergic disease, duration of symptoms at diagnosis, and CIU, ASST, or laboratory findings such

as total eosinophilic count, IgE, liver function test, thyroid function test, or ANA status. (Table 2)

Discussion

In our study, children with CSU generally showed good responses to medications. However, a
longer duration and higher treatment step for the initial control, higher initial UAS7 and UCT
scores, and food sensitization were risk factors for inadequate disease control. Although the
evaluation of allergic sensitization is not essential based on the current CSU guidelines,!4?!? our

results suggest that it may help predict the urticaria control status in the clinical setting.

In a recent study, children with CU had a higher prevalence of sensitization to house dust mites
and multiple sensitizations than those with acute urticaria, but there was no significant difference
in the prevalence of sensitization to food.'° In another study, children sensitized to food or inhalant
allergens spent more time on symptom improvement.!® In a study to identify factors associated
with symptom free for 1 month without medication in 253 children with CU, sensitized children
had a longer duration of CU. In our study, all children with CSU had a high prevalence of
allergen (71.3%), food (48.2%), and inhalant (49.0%) sensitization. Sensitization to food,
especially to multiple foods, was associated with an inadequate response to treatment. Although
adult CSU patients with positive ASST or positive SPT, mainly to house dust mite, had higher
UAS scores,”? no study has evaluated urticaria control status using the results of SPT and UAS, or

UCT in children.

CD63 expression in CSU patients with allergic sensitization was significantly higher than that
in those without sensitization.*4 A higher level of spontaneous basophil activation in CSU patients
with allergic sensitization? suggested that allergic sensitization may be an underlying factor
contributing to the pathogenesis of CSU. These results may support our findings, which indicated
that there was more inadequate control of CSU among food-sensitized children. Further studies are

required to identify the mechanism of the impact of allergen sensitization on CU control.

The prevalence of allergic diseases was higher in children and adults than in those without
CSU.!75 A strong link between CSU and allergic diseases was reported,’ and a history of atopic
dermatitis was considered an important risk factor for the subsequent occurrence of CSU.!!
Several studies have shown an association between allergic diseases and CU compared with the
normal population. In addition, our results showed that 51.0% of the patients had a history of
allergic disease. However, we did not find an association between CU control status and a history
of allergic diseases. We suspected that a history of atopic dermatitis might be a risk factor for

inadequate response to medications (P = 0.069). Further studies are warranted to identify the

association between atopic dermatitis and CU control using objective indicators.

When identifying the treatment steps for CU control and the response to management, most
children had a favorable response to the usual dose of 2"4 AH.*5° Our results also showed that
58.8% of the total patients had used the usual dose of 24 AH in order to achieve a UCT of 12
points. A total of 87.1% of the well-controlled group achieved 12 points of UCT within 3 months,
but 82.8% of the partly controlled group required 6 months. The higher treatment steps and longer
duration until the initial disease control and poor response to the first treatment were associated

with inadequate control of CSU.

The higher UAS7 score at the first visit was associated with inadequate control of CSU in our
study. Children with higher UAS7 at admission showed a longer persistence of symptoms and
needed more medications to improve the symptoms.*!® Therefore, UAS7 score and disease
activity at the first visit seemed to be significant factors for controlling CSU. Furthermore, initial
UCT scores were associated with CU control in the future. These findings suggest that active

treatment for CU control may be required to maintain the subsequent control status.

Our study evaluated CU control using UCT and investigated the risk factors according to the
CU control status. UCT was used to determine the level of disease control in CU patients as a
validated tool in adults.!”-!8 Although UCT has not yet been validated in children, we found that
UCT-based groups showed a reasonable correlation with the UAS7 score and the duration and
medication until initial CU control. Hence, UCT may be a useful tool to evaluate CU control status
in children. This is the first study to objectively evaluate CU control using UCT in children and to

investigate the associated factors.

The present study had some limitations. This study was conducted in a single tertiary center.
Therefore, selection bias might have occurred. Moreover, this study was a retrospective chart
review that there might be data missing or inappropriate records about the use of rescue
medication, personal and familial history of allergic diseases, and non-adherence. These might
cause bias. Furthermore, because we defined allergic sensitization of patients who were unable to
quit medication by MAST, a semi-quantitative method, careful interpretation is needed. However,
in the regression analysis, multiple sensitizations to foods were more strongly associated with CU
control than was mono sensitization; thus, food sensitization may be an essential factor for CU

control. We evaluated only food sensitization and did not confirm the food allergy using the food

provocation test. Because food sensitization is not equivalent to clinical food allergy, careful
interpretation is needed. Despite this limitation, the present study may have strength because we
used UAS and UCT as objective indicators to define the severity and control status and tried to
categorize the patients according to the level of control in a relatively large number of patients.

Our results may provide useful information regarding the control of CU in children.

In conclusion, a longer duration and higher treatment step until the initial disease control, the
initial UAS7 score, and food sensitization may be parameters for predicting inadequate response to
treatment. Efforts to reduce the duration of initial disease control, to define disease activity and

control status, and to find allergic sensitization can help in managing pediatric patients with CU.
