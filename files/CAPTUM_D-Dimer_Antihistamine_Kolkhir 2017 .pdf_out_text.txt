Summary

According to current guidelines, non-sedative H1-antihistamines (nsAH) are the first-line
therapy of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). But even up-dosed antihistamines (to four
times the standard dose) produce symptom resolution in less than 50% of patients. Biomarkers
that can predict the response to nsAH are still unknown. We carried out a prospective study
and used discriminant analysis to evaluate the combination of. ‘D-dimer, Sibrinogen, C-reactive protein and ESR values for predicting the outcome of treatment with levocetirizine in
84 CSU patients. We found that elevation of these parameters is associated with more active
disease, low quality of life and lack of response to standard doses of levocetirizine. Thus, evaluation of these markers may be considered useful before starting treatment with nsAH. The
mechanisms behind the increase in these parameters in CSU patients need to be elucidated in

To the Editor

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is defined as recurrence
of wheals, angioedema, or both for > 6 weeks due to known or
unknown causes. According to current guidelines, non-sedative
H1-antihistamines (nsAH) are the first-line therapy of CSU (1).
But even up-dosing to four times the standard dose can provide symptom control in only less than 50% of CSU patients
(2). Identification of biomarkers for predicting the response to
nsAH is necessary for developing an individualized treatment.
Total IgE, D-dimer, fibrinogen, ESR and C-reactive protein
(CRP) have been previously investigated as potential biomarkers of CSU activity and/or response to treatment (3-5). Herein,
we for the first time evaluated their combination for predicting
the outcome of treatment with levocetirizine in CSU patients.

This prospective study included 84 CSU patients seen from
2012 to 2015 at our Department. Patients with inducible urticaria, urticarial vasculitis and those, receiving anticoagulants,
steroids or immunosuppressive agents were excluded. The patients had no history of allergies, thrombosis and chronic infections.

On day 0, all patients stopped taking antihistamines for 5 days.
They filled out the Russian versions of Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire (CU-Q2oL) and Urticaria Activity
Score (UAS) on daily basis during this period. On day 5, serum
levels of total IgE, D-dimer and fibrinogen were measured using
ELISA, CRP - high-sensitive nephelometric method. ESR was
determined by Westergren method. Autologous serum skin test
(ASST) was performed to assess autoreactivity / autoimmunity.
Levocetirizine was then administrated at the dose of 5 mg/day

for 7 days. The efficacy of therapy was evaluated based on CUQ2oL and UAS scores.

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v.22.0 (IBM,
New York, USA). Mann-Whitney U-test, Pearson correlation coefficient, chi-square criterion x? and Cramer’s V were
employed for comparison between the parameters. Discriminant analysis was carried out to reveal predictive markers
of response to levocetirizine. We were interested in the relationship between a group of independent variables (ESR,
D-dimer, fibrinogen, CRP, total IgE, UAS and CU-Q2oL)
and one categorical variable (efficacy of levocetirizine). ESR,
D-dimer, fibrinogen, CRP, total IgE values were transformed
to normal distribution. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Of 84 CSU patients (aged 16-77 years), 25 (29.8%) were males
and 59 (70.2%) were females. ASST positive patients had sig
nificantly more active / severe disease (mean rank: 42.84 vs

31.13, U = 895, p = 0.019), higher serum levels of CRP (mean
rank: 43.02 vs 31.94, U = 901, p = 0.031) and D-dimer (mean
rank: 42.97 vs 30.95, U = 900.5, p = 0.019) than those with
negative ASST.

All patients were divided into two groups based on response
to levocetirizine for discriminant analysis: responders (n = 42,
50%) and non-responders (n = 42, 50%). Levocetirizine was
more often effective in patients with mild CSU compared to
those with severe disease (66.7 vs 22.9%, x? = 3.696, p = 0.05,
V = 0.228).

Of 42 responders, 7.1%, 9.5%, 12%, 31% and 47.6%, had
high serum levels or values of D-dimer, fibrinogen, ESR, CRP
and total IgE, respectively. Of 42 non-responders, 54.8%,
26.2%, 35.7%, 54.8% and 23.8% demonstrated elevated D-dimer, fibrinogen, ESR, CRP and total IgE, respectively.

The most important results of discriminant analysis are summarized in tables 1 and 2. Mean values of parameters in table 1

show that responders have higher levels of total IgE and lower
levels / values of D-dimer, fibrinogen, CRP and ESR, higher
CU-Q2oL and lower UAS scores compared to non-responders.
The results of univariate ANOVA’, carried out for each independent variable showed that ESR (p < 0.001), D-dimer (p <
0.001), CRP (p < 0.001), fibrinogen (p = 0.004), UAS (p =
0.005), CU-Q2oL (p < 0.001) and total IgE (p = 0.026) significantly differ for responders and non-responders.
Within-groups correlation matrix shows correlations between
predictors (table 2). There is a positive correlation between
D-dimer, fibrinogen, CRP and ESR. As already mentioned,
high levels of these are associated with lack of response to levocetirizine (table 1). There is also a negative correlation between
values of D-dimer and CU-Q2oL, CRP and CU-Q2oL, total
IgE and UAS, CU-Q2oL and UAS. Only tota
positively with CU-Q2oL.

Wilks’ lambda is 0.620, (x? = 37.471, p < 0.001) indicating a
good discriminatory ability of the discriminant

The summary of number of subjects classified correctly and
incorrectly for responders are 33 (78.6%) and 9 (21.4%), respectively. The summary of number of subjects classified correctly and incorrectly for non-responders are 34 (81%) and 8
(19.0%), respectively. The discriminant function worked equally well for each group of dependent variable. Overall, 79.8% of
cases are correctly classified.
To the best of our knowledge, we were the first to assess the set
of biomarkers in the same group of CSU patients for predicting
response to nsAH. The role of D-dimer and activation of coagulation in CSU pathogenesis is widely discussed (3-5). Patients
with high levels of D-dimer, fibrinogen and/or CRP are shown
to have severe CSU (3,5,6) that is in the line with the results of
our study,
We reported elevation of total IgE serum levels in responders
with mild CSU that is contradictory to the findings by Kessel

 

and co-workers where total IgE was suggested as a marker of
severe CSU (7). Thus, the role of total IgE in CSU should be
better characterized in further research.

IgG-anti-IgE/FceRI autoantibodies play a role in a subpopulation of CSU patients (8). We observed that positive ASST is
associated with more severe disease, higher serum levels of CRP
and D-dimer. Obtained results suggest that positive ASST is
more often seen in non-responders.

Thus, we found that the elevation of CRP, ESR, D-dimer and
fibrinogen is associated with more active disease, low quality

 

of life and lack of response to standard doses of levocetirizine.
Evaluation of these markers may be considered before starting
treatment with nsAH. Further research into the mechanisms
behind elevation of these parameters in antihistamine-resistant

CSU is required.

Learning points

¢ CRP ESR, D-dimer and fibrinogen seem to be useful
markers for prediction of response to levocetirizine in CSU
patients.

¢ Elevation of these markers is associated with more active
disease, low quality of life, and a lack of response to standard doses of levocetirizine.

¢ Evaluation of these parameters may be considered before
starting the treatment with non-sedative antihistamines,
and provides additional justification for administration
of high doses of antihistamines.
