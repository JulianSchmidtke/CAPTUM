What is already known about this topic? Cyclosporine A (CsA) is one of the recommended treatments in most clinical
practice guidelines for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). However, a well-designed study of CsA efficacy and safety in

CSU is lacking.

What does this article add to our knowledge? CsA is effective in the treatment of CSU. The safety profile of CsA

treatment shows dose dependency.

How does this study impact current management guidelines? For antihistamine-refractory patients with CSU, CsA at
a dose of 1 to 5 mg/kg/d can provide effective control of the symptoms, with adverse events occurring dose dependently.

BACKGROUND: Despite widely recommended usage of
cyclosporine A (CsA) in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU),
there is no meta-analysis concerning its efficacy and safety.
OBJECTIVE: To meta-analyze and review the efficacy and safety
of CsA in CSU.

METHODS: Efficacy was assessed by the relative change in
urticaria activity score at 4 weeks and response rates at 4, 8, and
12 weeks. Safety was assessed by analyzing the number of
patients with 1 or more adverse event.

RESULTS: Eighteen studies (909 participants) including 2
randomized controlled trials were included, with 125, 363, and
266 patients with CSU receiving very low (<2 mg/kg/d), low
(from 2 to< 4 mg/kg/d), and moderate (4-5 mg/kg/d) doses of
CsA, respectively. After 4 weeks, the mean relative change in
urticaria activity score of CsA-treated patients was — 17.89,
whereas that of controls was — 2.3. The overall response rate to
CsA treatment with low to moderate doses at 4, 8, and 12 weeks

was 54%, 66%, and 73%, respectively. No studies of very lowdose CsA evaluated response rates at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Among
patients treated with very low, low, and moderate doses of CsA,
6%, 23%, and 57% experienced 1 or more adverse event,
respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: Given the limited number and quality of
studies, our results should be interpreted with caution. CsA is
effective at low to moderate doses. Adverse events appear to be
dose dependent and occur in more than half the patients treated
with moderate doses of CsA. We suggest that the appropriate
dosage of CsA for CSU may range from 1 to 5 mg/kg/d, and 3
mg/kg/d is a reasonable starting dose for most patients. © 2017

Key words: Cyclosporine; Chronic spontaneous urticaria; Metaanalysis; Efficacy; Safety

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), previously also called
chronic idiopathic urticaria, is defined as the occurrence of
spontaneous wheals, angioedema, or both for more than 6 weeks,
Modern second-generation H, antihistamines are recommended
by the EAACI/GA*LEN/EDF/WAO guideline as the first-line
treatment of CSU on the basis of high-quality evidence and
their very good risk/benefit profile. If symptoms persist after 2
weeks of treatment, up to 4-fold dosed second H, antihistamines
are recommended.' For antihistamine-refractory patients, omalizumab is the recommended treatment option. According to the
2017 update and revision of the EAACI/GA*LEN/EDF/WAO
guideline, cyclosporine (CsA) should be used in patients with
severe disease refractory to antihistamine and omalizumab treatment. The guideline, however, does not provide recommendations on the dosing of CsA or the duration of treatment.'

CsA is effective in the treatment of CSU on the basis of
longstanding and broad experience and several reported studies.
These studies include randomized controlled trials (RCTs),
noncontrolled prospective studies, retrospective studies, case
series, and case reports. CsA inhibits activated Ty cells by

blocking the production of inflammatory cytokines. CsA binds
to cyclophilins and inhibits the activity of calcineurin to dephosphorylate the nuclear factor of activated T cells. As a result,
the nuclear factor of activated T cells is not able to translocate to
the nucleus, which reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, and TNE-@..7 IL-4 is involved in
the generation of IgE, which can induce and enhance mast cell
activation.’ Jn vitro studies showed that preincubating leukocytes
with CsA may inhibit histamine secretion after stimulating with
sera from patients with urticaria who have functional IgG antibodies directed against the alpha subunit of the IgE receptor.
This effect was dose-dependent and was not found for other
drugs including methotrexate, diphenhydramine, or hydroxyzine.’ CsA also has effects on mast cells. For example, Harrison
et al’ showed that CsA inhibits the IgE-mediated release of
histamine from mast cells in a concentration-dependent manner.
Grattan et al’ reported a reduction in serum histamine-teleasing
activity and the autologous serum skin test response after CsA
treatment.’ Also, CsA reportedly reduces serum levels of IL-2R,
IL-5, and TNF-«.° Taken together, these findings support the
notion that the mechanisms of action of CsA in CSU may
involve effects on activated T cells, basophils, mast cells, and
perhaps other cells.

Despite the fact that CsA is a recommended and widely used
treatment option for CSU, it is still an off-label treatment and
there is no meta-analysis regarding its efficacy and safety. To
close this gap of knowledge, we reviewed the literature and
performed a meta-analysis focusing on the evaluation of the effects of CsA on disease activity and response rates as well as rates
of adverse events of CsA treatment in patients with CSU.

 

METHODS

This meta-analysis and systematic review was done following
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis
recommendations.”

Search strategy and eligibility criteria

A literature search of electronic database (PubMed, MEDLINE,
Embase, and Web of Science) from September 1980 until
November 2016 was conducted using the search terms “(cyclosporine
OR cyclosporin OR ciclosporin) and urticaria.” The eligibility criteria
for reports to be included in our systematic review were as follows:
(1) RCTs and non-RCTs; (2) patients with CSU treated with CsA;
(3) any of the following outcomes were reported: the relative change
in CSU activity, response rates, and/or rates of CsA-treated patients
with adverse events or number of adverse events. Review articles,
case reports, case series, in vitro studies, comments, and replies were
excluded. Articles that were not published in English as well as
non—full-text publications were also excluded. Titles and abstracts of
the remaining articles were screened by 2 independent reviewers

 

(K.K. and P.C.) for their eligibility on the basis of inclusion criteria.
Full texts were then obtained and reviewed for eligibility by the 2
reviewers (K.K. and P.C.). This search yielded 18 relevant reports, all

MONTH 2017

of which were systematically reviewed and assessed for eligibility to
be included in the meta-analysis (Figure 1).

Inclusion criteria for meta-analysis

The 18 reports identified were then assessed for their suitability to
be meta-analyzed. To be included in our meta-analysis, study reports
had to include data on 1 or more of the following outcome
parameters.

Relative change in urticaria activity score at 4
weeks. Effects of CsA on CSU activity were assessed by analysis
of the relative change in mean urticaria activity score (UAS) between
baseline and 4 weeks of CsA treatment. We included only those
studies that reported UAS data (mean or difference in mean) and

95% CIs with SD or SEs.

Response rates at 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. We categorized CsA dosages into 3 groups: (1) very low (<2
mg/kg/d), (2) low (from 2 to <4 mg/kg/d), and (3) moderate (4-5 mg/
kg/d). We meta-analyzed the rates of patients who showed a beneficial

 

response to CsA treatment at 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment.
However, no studies of very low-dose CsA (<2 mg/kg/d) evaluated
response rates at 4, 8, and 12 weeks.*!" We also compared. 12-week
response rates of patients treated with various dosages of CsA.

Safety as assessed by rates of patients with 1 or
more adverse event and number of major and other
adverse events. We performed meta-analysis of the rates of
patients with adverse events and of the number of major and other
adverse events, for treatment groups that received very low, low, or
moderate doses of CsA. Hypertension and abnormal renal function
detected by increased serum creatinine were categorized as major
adverse events.

Data extraction and bias assessments

Data were independently extracted by 2 reviewers and the use of a
standardized data extraction form. Relevant information extracted
included first author, year of publication, country of study, study
design, sex of patients, number of CsA-treated patients and controls,
dose and treatment duration of CsA, assessment of outcome,
response rates and change in CSU activity after treatment with CsA,
as well as rates of relapse and adverse events. Discrepancies identified
during data extraction were resolved by consensus meetings of the
authors. Quality and risk of bias of included studies were assessed
with the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing the risk of bias
for RCTs'' and with the Methodological Index for NonRandomized Studies for non-RCTs.'~

Statistical analysis

Pooled results were estimated using a random-effects model due
to the heterogeneity of included studies. To examine this heterogeneity, we used Cochrane’s Q statistic and the F statistic to
quantify total variation across studies. An F value of 25%, 50%, and
75% was considered to indicate low, moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively.'’ Funnel plot and Egger’s regression test were
done to detect the existence of publication bias. All statistical tests
were 2-sided using an alpha level of 0.05. For all results, a 2-sided P
value of .05 or less was considered to indicate statistical significance.
All meta-analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta
Analysis software version 3 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ).

FIGURE 1. Flow diagram of literature review in this study. *In the different studies, various disease activity scores were used to assess
the effects of CsA on CSU. Of 5 studies that used the UAS, 3 were included in the meta-analysis.° ®2° Two studies were excluded

excluded from this analysis because of the rapid and aggressive tapering protocol used and the very high dropout rate. We had originally
planned to compare response rates of treatment groups with very low, low, and moderate doses at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. However, the
number of reports was limited and no studies of very low-dose CsA evaluated response rates at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Therefore, the pooled
response rates for all CsA doses at 4, 8, and 12 weeks of CsA treatment were analyzed (n = 12 studies).°°° '0'141®21.23.24 In addition,

FIGURE 2. Mean relative change in 7-day UAS after treatment with cyclosporine A for 4 weeks. *Patients with CSU in Baskan et al?°
were randomized to 4-week (group1) or 12-week (group2) CsA treatment group.

The quality and risk of bias of included studies are presented in
Table I.

The 18 studies analyzed included a total of 909 patients with
CSU (females 487 [68.5%]) in 8 countries of which 855 were
antihistamine-resistant (Table II). Of 909 patients with CSU,
125, 363, and 266 patients received very low (<2 mg/kg/d), low
(from 2 to <4 mg/kg/d), and moderate (4-5 mg/kg/d) doses of
CsA, respectively. Sixteen studies were conducted in adult patients, 1 in children.*“ Three, 12, and 12 of these 1844 studies,
respectively, were meta-analyzed for treatment effects, "7°

Meta-analysis results

Relative changes in UAS at 4 weeks. After 4 weeks of
CsA treatment, the pooled statistical estimate of mean relative
UAS7 changes from baseline was —17.89 (95% CI, —21.95
to —13.83) (3 studies; Q = 2.91; P = 0%; P = .06; Figure 2).
The mean relative UAS7 change in the placebo-treated control
group was —2.3 (1 study; 95% CI, —3.72 to —0.88). The mean
relative UAS change from baseline after treatment with CsA
was significantly different from that of treatment with placebo
(Q = 52.04; P< .001).

Response rates at 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment. The pooled statistical estimate of response rates after 4,
8, and 12 weeks of CsA treatment was 54.2% (95% CI, 32.9%74.1%), 65.9% (95% CI, 30.0%-89.7%), and 73.1% (95% Cl,
65.4%-79.5%), respectively (Figure 3, A). However, high
heterogeneity was observed at 4 weeks (Q = 24.87; P=75.81;
P< .001) and 8 weeks (Q = 19.69; P = 84.97; P< .001). The
pooled response rates after treatment with CsA at 4, 8, and 12
weeks were not significantly different (Q = 2.99; P = .22).

At 12 weeks of treatment, the pooled response rate for lowdose CsA was 69.9% (95% CI, 63.1%-75.9%) (Q = 4.94;
P = 0; P = .42) versus 84.3% for moderate-dose CsA (95% CI,
69.3%-92.8%) (Q = 0.02; ? = 0; P = .65; Figure 3, B). The

pooled response rates after treatment with low or moderate doses
of CsA were not statistically different (Q = 3.19; P = .07).

Figure 4 shows funnel plots evaluating the publication bias of
studies of the response rates at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. At 4 and 8
weeks, visual inspection of funnel plots could not exclude a
publication bias. However, Egger’s regression test did not
demonstrate publication bias (P > .05). At 12 weeks, no publication bias was detected.

Safety. When we meta-analyzed and compared the safety of
CsA treatment in patients treated with very low, low, and
moderated doses of CsA, 6.2% (95% CI, 1.0%-29.8%;
Q = 14.99; P = 73.32; P = .005), 23.4% (95% CI, 14.4%35.6%; Q = 20.56; P = 75.68; P = .001), and 57.9% (95%
Cl, 32.3%-79.8%; Q = 39.61; P = 84.85; P < .001) of
patients with CSU experienced at least 1 adverse event, respectively (Figure 5, A). The number of patients with at least 1
adverse event was statistically different among CsA dosages
(Q = 9.61; P = .008).

Major adverse events including hypertension and abnormal
serum creatinine were detected in 6.2% (95% CI, 1.7%-42.4%;
Q=8.12; FP = 50.79; P = .09) of the patients after treatment
with very low-dose CsA, 12.8% (95% CI, 8.6%-18.7%;
Q= 1.62; P = 0; P = .66) after treatment with low-dose CsA,
and 10.3% (95% CI, 6.4%-16.2%; Q = 2.43; P = 0; P=.79)
after treatment with moderately dosed CsA (Figure 5, B). The
number of major adverse events was not statistically different
among CsA dosages (Q = 1.16; P = .56).

Other adverse events such as gastrointestinal symptoms,
headache, hirsutism, infection, and paresthesia were observed in
5.7% (95% CI, 2.1%-14.9%; Q = 2.48; P = 19.49; P= .29),
13.9% (95% CI, 10.1%-18.8%; Q = 8.34; P = 16.08; P=
.30), and 46.2% (95% CI, 23.0%-71.2%; Q = 35.32; P =
83.01; P < .001) of patients treated with very low, low, and
moderate doses of CsA, respectively. The number of other
adverse events was significantly different among CsA dosages
(Q = 12.84; P = .002) (Figure 5, C).

Results of the systematic review: Insights on the
efficacy, safety, quality-of-life improvement, and
relapse rates of CsA treatment

Efficacy. CsA was reported to be beneficial in all included
studies and to be more efficacious than placebo in the 2 studies
that tested this.”'* The response rates at weeks 2, 3, and 4 were
100% in the studies of Serhat Inaloz et al,° Di Gioacchino
etal,’ and Loria et al.”! Both CsA and prednisolone led to rapid
clinical responses, but discontinuation of prednisolone showed
higher relapse rates compared with that of CsA (40% vs 20%).°'
The retrospective study by Savic et al”? revealed that patients
with CSU treated with omalizumab had higher rates of complete
resolution of disease (42%; using UAS7) compared with those
treated with CsA (17%; using clinician-documented comments).

Ohtsuka'® showed that patients with CSU with elevated highsensitivity C-reactive protein required shorter duration of treatment than did patients without elevation (8.7 + 1.3 months vs
15.3 + 2.8 months). Frezzolini et al’’ demonstrated that seruminduced basophil CD63 expression (basophil activation test) in
patients with chronic urticaria with a positive autologous serum
skin test result was significantly decreased during CsA treatment.
Iqbal et al”° revealed that patients with CSU with a positive
basophil activation test result had higher response rates than did
those with a negative basophil activation test.

Hollander et al® used an initial dose of 1 mg/kg/d and
increased by 25 to 50 mg every 2 to 4 weeks (average dose, 1.8 +
1.1 mg/kg/d) until complete remission or until CsA through
levels were 100 to 200 ng/mL. The dose was maintained for the
next 6 months after complete remission and then tapered off. OF
64 patients (94.1%) who responded to CsA, 53 patients (78%)

 

 

 

 

had complete remission. Seven patients (13.2%) had recurrence
of disease. However, the average treatment duration to achieve
remission was 20.8 weeks, which was longer than in other
studies.

Di Leo et al’ evaluated the efficacy of CsA with different
dosing regimens in 110 patients with CSU. Patients were categorized into 3 groups by dosage of CsA as follows: (A) 1 to 1.5
mg/kg/d, (B) 1.6-2 mg/kg/d, and (C) 2.1-3 mg/kg/d. After 24
weeks of treatment, the percentages of responders in groups A, B,
and C were 63, 76, and 85, respectively, in a dose-dependent
relationship. Complete resolution rates for groups A, B, and C
were 28%, 37.5%, and 45%, respectively. However, 13.2% of
group C had rising serum creatinine (Table III).

Kessel and Toubi'® studied long-term CsA in 120 patients
with CSU. After treatment with CsA at 3 mg/kg/d for 3 months,
20 CsA-dependent patients had to continue CsA at doses of 1 to
2 mg/kg/d for 8 to 14 months. Twelve of 20 patients needed to
continue with low-dose CsA (1-1.5 mg/kg/d) for 5 to 10 years.

Safety. Adverse events in patients with CSU on CsA increased
with higher doses and longer duration of treatment (Table III).
In all studies, durations of treatment with very low-dose CsA
were more than 20 weeks, but with low- and moderate-dosed
CsA they were less than 24 weeks and less than 16 weeks,
respectively. Elevated serum creatinine due to CsA was found in
4.8% of patients with CSU. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as
abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting were the most common
adverse events from CsA. Other frequently observed adverse
events were hypertension, paresthesia, headache, hirsutism, and
mild infection. However, most of the adverse events from CsA.
were mild and resolved after reducing the dose.°” oa eae

discontinuation due to adverse events in 4 of 68 (5.9%) and 13
of 72 (18.1%) patients, respectively.

Quality of life

Two studies reported improvement in patient’s quality of life
after the patients received CsA.'*?? At 8 and 16 weeks,
Dermatology Life Quality Index values were significantly
decreased in CsA-treated patients compared with placebo (P <
.05).'* Savic et al’? reported an improvement of at least 75% in
Dermatology Life Quality Index scores of 79% of omalizumabtreated patients and 41% of CsA-treated patients.

Relapse rates. Twelve CSU studies reported relapse rates
after CsA treatment discontinuation, which ranged from 11% to
100%. 47° Ther et al” initially started CsA at 5 mg/kg/
d for 1 week, decreased to 3.5 mg/kg/d for another week, and
then continued with 2.5 mg/kg/d for 5 weeks in 15 patients.”
At the initial dosage, all patients showed disease resolution.
But when CsA was tapered, 86.7% of patients dropped out from
the study because of uncontrolled disease. Only 2 patients
continued CsA until the end of treatment. However, their diseases relapsed within a few days after stopping the treatment.”

Two studies reported conflicting results in relapse rates with
different treatment durations.'*”° Vena et al'* demonstrated that
relapse rates after 16 weeks of CsA treatment (19.4%) were lower
than after 8 weeks of treatment (42.4%). Conversely, Baskan
et al” showed that patients with CSU treated with CsA for 12
weeks had a higher relapse rate (37.5%) than those treated for 4
weeks (20%).

 

DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis of CsA efficacy and safety in CSU treatment. Its results suggest that CsA is
effective in the treatment of CSU, and that its safety is dose
dependent. But it should be kept in mind that the number of
studies in this meta-analysis is small, and many of them are of
limited quality. For example, only 3 studies were found to be
suitable for meta-analyzing CsA treatment effects on UAS7 in
CSU, and only 1 of these 3 studies was an RCT.

Our results provide only limited guidance on how to select the
best dosing scheme for the treatment of CSU. Clearly, the efficacy
of CsA is dose dependent, and moderate doses of CsA appear to be
more effective than lower doses. Little can be said about the
benefit of increasing or tapering the dose of CsA in the treatment
of CSU. Galindo Bonilla et al”® suggested that the most effective
CsA regimen in the treatment of CSU is 3 mg/kg/d for 6 weeks,
‘ollowed by 2 mg/kg/d for 3 weeks and 1 mg/kg/d for 1 week and
subsequent discontinuation. On the other hand, the results of our
meta-analysis show that low-dose CsA (from 2 to <4 mg/kg/d) for
2 weeks significantly improves clinical severity in 70% of patients
with CSU (Figure 3, B).
CsA is used in the treatment of various other dermatologic
diseases including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. In psoriasis, a
common starting dose of CsA is 2.5 mg/kg/d, and doses are
requently increased up to 5 mg/kg/d if the response is inadequate.””” °° For atopic dermatitis, CsA is often started at 5 mg/kg/
d for 2 weeks and subsequent tapered to 1.5 mg/kg/d with a total
3 months of treatment.°!~° Similar to CSU, responses to CsA in
both psoriasis and atopic dermatitis are dose dependent, with
more rapid responses at higher doses.“ Overall response
rates to CsA treatment at 4, 8, and 12 weeks were 54%, 66%,

 

 

 
J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT
VOLUME Mf, NUMBER

and 73%, respectively. This suggests that patients who do not
respond well within 4 weeks may benefit from continued treatment for up to 12 weeks. But again, more and better studies are
needed to assess the benefit and long-term safety of CsA treatment for longer than 3 months.

Adverse events must be expected in CsA-treated patients, and
our study demonstrates that rates of adverse events increase with
the doses of CsA used, regardless of the duration of treatment.
Two important adverse events from CsA are nephrotoxicity,
detected by increased serum creatinine, and hypertension. Most
previous psoriasis studies found the nephrotoxic effects of CsA to
be dose-related, with a high risk of persistent renal dysfunction
after more than 2 years of CsA treatment or doses of greater than
5 mg/kg/d**** and low rates of 1 in 5 patients showing elevated
serum creatinine when treated with low doses of CsA (<3 mg/
kg/d) for 1 year.” In contrast, 3 studies did not find a relationship between the dose of CsA and rates of renal side effects or
hypertension in patients with psoriasis.°”“' In the studies we
analyzed, hypertension was reported in 5.8% of patients with
CSU. Interestingly, no abnormal serum creatinine or high blood
pressure was observed even in patients with CSU with prolonged
treatment of up to 10 years with CsA, albeit at very low doses
(1-1.5 mg/kg/d)."°

With CsA treatment, the increased risk of malignancies is
another matter of concern. In patients with psoriasis treated with
low-dose CsA (2.7-3.1 mg/kg/d) for 2 years, the risk of cutaneous
squamous cell carcinoma was reported to be increased to 6-fold
after a 5-year follow-up period."* The risk increased further
with longer treatment duration or with history of psoralenultraviolet A therapy.** Three patients with psoriasis developed
a lymphoproliferative disorder during 2 to 3 years of CsA therapy,
but the disorder resolved rapidly after withdrawal of CsA.?
However, it should be noted that psoriasis per se is linked to a
higher incidence of lymphoma and malignancies. ***? The studies
we analyzed did not report any evidence that CsA treatment
causes malignancies in patients with CSU. Kessel and Toubi'?
reported no incidence of malignancy even after long-term CsA
treatment in CSU. Nevertheless, the risk of malignancies in the
treatment of CSU with CsA should be kept in mind.

Given the limited number and quality of studies, our metaanalysis results should be interpreted with caution. Our findings suggest that CsA is effective at low (from 2 to <4 mg/kg/d)
to moderate doses (4-5 mg/kg/d). Adverse events appear to be
dose dependent and occur in more than half the patients treated
with moderate doses of CsA. We suggest that the appropriate
dosage of CsA for CSU may range from 1 to 5 mg/kg/d, and that

3 mg/kg/d is a reasonable starting dose for most patients.
