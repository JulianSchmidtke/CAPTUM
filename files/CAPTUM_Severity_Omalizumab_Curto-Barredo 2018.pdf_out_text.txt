Omalizumab updosing allows disease activity
control in patients with refractory chronic
spontaneous urticaria

DOI: 10.1111/bjd.16379

Dear Eprror, Omalizumab has been shown to be a very effective drug in treating chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU),
improving patients’ quality of life.' The phase III clinical trials
ASTERIA I/II and GLACIAL showed, respectively, 58-8% and
524% of patients achieving a twice-daily average Urticaria
Activity Score 7 (UAS7td) < 6 at week 12.* Outside of clinical
trials, the response varies between 77% and 83%? However,
some patients do not achieve well-controlled activity of the
disease with the licensed dose of omalizumab [300 mg/
4 weeks (mg/4w)].

With the hypothesis that omalizumab updosing may be
useful in some patients with partial or nonresponse, an
observational, multicentre study was conducted by the ‘Catalan and Balearic Chronic Urticaria Network, XUrCB’ including 15 hospitals. The medical charts of 286 patients with
CSU treated with omalizumab were reviewed retrospectively.
CSU activity was assessed according to the EAACI/GA(2)
LEN/EDF/WAO guideline recommendations.* We considered
CSU to be controlled when once-daily UAS7 (UAS7od) was
< 6 [range 0-42 (perfectly controlled disease to uncontrolled
disease) ].

In order to look for factors that could predict the need
for omalizumab updosing, the 286 patients with CSU were
UAS7od < 6 with
300 mg/4w (licenced-dose responders, LDr); Group 2:
UAS7od < 6 with 450-600 mg/4w (high-dose responders,
HDr); and Group 3: patients not achieving UAS7od < 6
Nr). The

included in the multivariate analysis were: baseline UAS7od,

divided into three groups: Group 1:

despite updosing (nonresponders, variables
inducible urticaria, angio-oedema, sex, age, body mass index
(BMI), total immunoglobulin (Ig) E, p-dimer and previous
immunosuppressive treatments. Ethics approval was granted
by the Committee for Clinical Research (2016/6606/IEUDRAC).

Demographic and clinical features of patients are summarized in Table 1. With the licensed dose, 65% of patients
(n= 187) reached UAS7od < 6, mostly during the first
3 months of treatment (83%). In 80% of partial or Nr
patients (n = 79) the dose was increased. Of these, 75%
(n = 59) achieved UAS7od < 6 (55% at 450 mg/4w and

20% at 600 mg/4w); all the patients treated with the

210 British Journal of Dermatology (2018) 179, pp210-212

600 mg/4w had received the 450 mg/4w previously

(Fig. 1).

Bivariate analysis showed that when the licenced dose was
not enough to reach UAS7od < 6, ciclosporin A (CicA) was
previously used more frequently (41% in HDr vs. 21% in
LDr, P = 0-04).

The multivariate analysis comparing Group 1 vs. Group 2
showed a significant association of omalizumab updosing with
BMI (OR 1-14, P = 0-004), as well as with age (OR 1-038,
P = 0-013). There were no significant statistical differences in
the other variables studied. The aggregate analysis comparing
Groups 1 + 2 vs. Group 3 did not show any statistically significant association. No serious adverse events were reported
at any dose.

In our series, 65% of patients with CSU responded very
well to omalizumab 300 mg/4w. However, 21% of the global patient population needed the updosing to reach UAS7od
< 6 and 7% did not achieve control of the disease despite
increasing the dose. Predictors of partial response to
300 mg/4w and good response with the updosing were
previous treatment with CicA, obesity and age > 57 years

old. Our data agree with that of Ghazanfar et al.,’ suggesting

that previous immunosuppressant treatments are associated
with a worse response to omalizumab. The previous use of
CicA could alter the responsiveness to omalizumab by modifying patients’ immune status or may reflect the severity of
the disease itself.

Obesity is currently considered a chronic low-grade inflammatory condition because visceral fat is known to be a potential source of proinflammatory cytokines. Long-term efficacy
of biologics in other inflammatory cutaneous diseases such as
psoriasis is influenced by BMI, so this also may be the case of
omalizumab in CSU. Although in CSU there is not a requirement to adjust the dose based on the weight, it is considered
in patients with asthma.

Omalizumab has been demonstrated to be safe in the
elderly but the reason why older patients required higher
doses to control the disease is still unknown.°

No differences in these predictive factors were found when
comparing CSU responders (Group 1 + 2) vs. Nr (Group 3),
suggesting other factors may be involved such as a low baseline high-affinity IgE receptor in blood basophils (FcéRI),
which has been shown to correlate with the response to omalizumab.’

The decision to increase the dose in patients who show a
partial response to omalizumab could be considered after the
third dose administration based on the experience published
by Gericke et al. regarding the time to good control obtained
by slow responders to omalizumab.* According to these
authors and our data, we suggest periodic evaluation of treatment every 3 months.

Omalizumab updosing is safe and should be considered in
partial or nonresponder patients (UAS7 > 6). The predicted
likelihood of success is greater when the BMI is 30 or higher,

is related to its retrospective nature.
