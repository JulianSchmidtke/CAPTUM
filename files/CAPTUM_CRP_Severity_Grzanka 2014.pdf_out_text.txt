Background: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is an immune-inflammatory disease, characterized by acute
phase response (APR) and immune activation. There has been increasing evidence showing that vitamin D
deficiency/insufficiency is associated with increased incidence and/or severity of immune-inflammatory disorders.

Methods: Concentrations of CRP and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], a biomarker of vitamin D status were
measured in serum of CSU patients and compared with the healthy controls.

Results: Serum 25(OH)D concentration was significantly lower in CSU group as compared with the normal subjects.
The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (< 20 ng/ml) was significantly higher in patients with CSU than among
normal population. There were no significant differences in prevalence of 25(OH)D insufficiency between the
groups. Serum CRP concentrations were significantly higher in CSU patients as compared with the healthy subjects.
There were no significant correlations between CRP and 25(OH)D concentrations in CSU patients.

Conclusions: CSU is associated with lower serum 25(OH)D concentration and higher prevalence of its deficiency.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is an inflammatory
disease, characterized by acute phase response (APR) and
in many cases by the immune-activation. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker of systemic CSU activity, reflecting
the systemic effects of inflammatory mediators associated
with the disease, including IL-6 [1-5]. The altered function
of the neuro-endocrine-immune system has also been recognized in the pathogenesis [6].

There has been increasing evidence showing that vitamin
D deficiency/insufficiency is associated with increased incidence and severity/activity of the immune-inflammatory
disorders. Vitamin D has immunomodulatory properties
and is able to suppress the inflammatory milieu, including
IL-6 and CRP synthesis [7-9]. In the clinical practice, vitamin D status is assessed by measurement of the circulating
level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], considered as
the best indicator of vitamin D status, including its availability [10,11].

Little data are available on vitamin D status in CSU patients. To estimate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency
and insufficiency in CU, serum 25(OH)D concentrations
were compared between CSU patients and the healthy

controls. In addition, relationship between vitamin D status and C-reactive protein (CRP), a nonspecific inflammatory marker of the disease activity, was assessed.

Materials and methods

35 patients with active CSU (20 and 15 men women;
median age: 35 years, range: 22-51) with a median disease duration of 3.5 years were enrolled in the study.

In all cases, any known causes of CSU were ruled out by
appropriate investigations. Each patient underwent the
following tests: routine laboratory tests (full blood count,
urine analysis, ESR, C-reactive protein, serum glucose,
hepatic functions, and creatinine), stool (for parasites),
hepatitis serology, antinuclear and antithyroid microsomal
antibodies, thyroid function tests, chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasonography. Additionally, dental, and ENT consultations as well as the autologous serum skin test
(ASST) were performed.

All the patients were divided into several subgroups,
according to the urticarial activity score (UAS), autologous serum skin test (ASST), glucocorticoids therapy response as well as serum 25(OH)D concentration defined
as: a) sufficiency (230 ng/ml), b) insufficiency (between
20 and 29 ng/ml), c) deficiency (< 20 ng/ml), d) critically
low level (< 10 ng/ml),

UAS according to EAACI/GALEN/EDF guidelines [12]
was estimated during four days and on the blood sampling day and graded as follows: mild (0-8), moderate
(9-16) and severe (17-24). The study comprised 12 patients with mild and 23 patients with moderate-severe
utricaria symptoms.

H1- antihistamine drugs were withdrawn at least 4 days
before blood sampling. At the time of blood sampling,
only 9 patients were receiving low doses of oral glucocorticoids (GC) (5-10 mg prednisolone per day). None
of the remaining patients had been taking immunosuppressants or any other drugs, for at least 8 weeks before
the study.

The control group comprised 33 sex-, age- and BMI
(< 30) matched the healthy subjects.

The Ethics Committee of the Medical University of
Silesia approved of the study and written, informed consent was obtained from all the subjects participating.

Blood collection

All blood samples were obtained between 7 and 9 a.m.
by anticubital puncture. As the circulating levels of 25
(OH)D vary depending on the season, the concentration
was evaluated in summer (June through September).

Assay of 25(OH)D

Serum 25(OH)D concentration was measured with the
use of an automated direct electrochemiluminescence
immunoassay (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostic, Mannheim

Page 2 of 5

Germany) with the detection limit of 3.0 ng/ml. Sufficient
vitamin D concentration was defined as 230 ng/ml.

Assay of CRP

Serum CRP concentration was measured by the turbidimetric latex agglutination method (CRP-Latex, BioSystems SA, Barcelona, Spain) with a detection limit of
1.0 mg/l. Elevated serum CRP was defined as higher
than 5.0 mg/l.

Autologous serum skin test (ASST)

Intradermal ASST was performed following the method
by Sabroe et al. [13]. Serum-induced a red wheal response of diameter greater by at least 1.5 mm than that
of a control wheal induced by physiological saline was
accepted as positive. Skin prick test with histamine
served as a positive control.

Statistical analysis

Results are expressed as median and _inter-quartile
ranges. Because data were not distributed normally, nonparametric tests were used. Kruskal-Wallis variance analysis was used to screen differences between the groups.
Mann-Whitney U/ and the Fisher exact tests were used
to compare data between the patient groups and the
normal population. Spearman’s rank test was used for
correlations. The probability value of P<.05 was assumed significant.

Results

Serum 25(OH)D concentration

Serum 25(OH)D concentration was significantly lower
in CSU group as compared with the normal subjects
(median: 26.0 vs. 31.1 ng/ml, p = 0.017) (Figure 1). There
were no significant differences in serum 25(OH)D concentration between the CSU patients with mild and
moderate-severe symptoms (median: 27.3 vs. 22.6 ng/ml,

p = 0.53). However, 25(OH)D concentrations were slightly
yet significantly lower in moderate-severe CSU than those
of the controls (22.6 vs. 31.1 ng/ml, p = 0.048). There were
no significant differences in concentrations between mild
CSU patients and the healthy subjects (27.3 vs, 31.1 ng/ml,
p= 0.13) (Figure 1).

Moreover, there were no significant differences in
serum concentrations of 25(OH)D in moderate-severe
CSU patients with and without glucocorticoid therapy
(p = 0.57).

CSU subgroup without glucocorticoids was_significantly lower as compared with the healthy subjects (data
not shown).

Deficiency and insufficiency of vitamin D

The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (< 20 ng/ml)
was significantly higher in patients with CU than in the
normal population. There were no significant differences
in the prevalence of 25(OH)D insufficiency (220 ng/ml
but <30 ng/ml) between CU patients and the normal
subjects (Table 1).

Serum CRP concentration
Serum CRP concentrations were significantly higher in
CSU patients (currently untreated with GC) as compared
with the healthy subjects (median: 7.1 vs. 0.8 mg/l, p<
0.0001). There was significant difference in CRP serum
concentration between patients with mild and moderatesevere CSU (without GC) (median: 1.7 vs. 11.7 g/L, p<
0.0001). CRP serum concentration was significantly lower
in moderate-severe CU patients with GC as compared
with those without GC therapy, and was similar to the
healthy subjects (median: 1.8 vs. 11.7 vs. 0.8 g/L, p < 0.5).
No significant differences in 25(OH)D and CRP concentrations between ASST(+) and ASST(-) CU patients
were observed.

Associations

There were no significant correlations between serum
concentrations of CRP and 25(OH)D (r = -0.16, p = 0.45)
in CSU patients without GC therapy. In addition, no

Page 3 of 5

correlation was found between the disease duration and
25(OH)D concentration.

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, there have only been two
reports regarding vitamin D in CU [14,15].

Thorp et al. reported that serum 25(OH)D concentration was reduced as compared to that in patients with allergic rhinitis [14]. However, it has been suggested that the
prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency was significantly
higher in patients with allergic rhinitis than among the
normal population [16]. Therefore, in the present study
we compared CSU patients with the healthy subjects.
Similarly to the previous study, serum 25(OH)D concentration in CSU patients decreased as compared with the
healthy subjects.

Thorp et al. showed that the proportion of all subjects
with vitamin D deficiency (defined as 25-OHD < 30 ng/
ml) was not significantly different between the 2 groups:
chronic urticaria, 48% (12/25) versus controls, 28% (7/25;
p= 0.24) [14]. In our study the subjects were divided into
three groups according to serum 25(OH)D concentration,
to describe vitamin D status: deficiency (<20 ng/ml), insufficiency (between 21 and 29 ng/ml), critically low level (<
10 ng/ml) as defined by most experts [10,17]. In contrasts
to the previous study the proportion of vitamin D deficiency proved significantly higher in CSU patients.

The reason for such discrepancy is unclear, although it
may be related to various factors, including 1) differences
in the control group (healthy versus allergic rhinitis subjects), 2) seasons during which blood was collected, 3) regions and/or countries, 4) lifestyle. It has been reported
that serum 25(OH)D concentrations in the European
countries are lower than in the United States [10,17,18].

There were not significant differences in serum 25(OH)
D concentrations in CSU patients with and without glucocorticoid therapy. We found no association between
serum concentrations of 25-(OH)D and the glucocorticoids doses in CSU patients. This is in accordance with
the previous studies indicating that serum 25(OH)D concentration is unaffected by treatment, even with high

doses of glucocorticoids [19]. Taken together, it seems unlikely that the glucocorticoid treatment of our patients is
responsible for lower serum concentrations of 25(OH)D.

Although our and Thorp et al. results point to some
changes in vitamin D status, such as a decrease in serum
25(OH)D concentration [14], conclusions regarding the
reasons for reduced concentration as well as relevance of
such results for a possible risk factor in CSU and/or the
disease activity cannot yet be drawn. While some data suggest that 25(OH)D levels are associated with an increased
activity/severity of the inflammatory diseases [7], we found
no relationship between serum concentrations of 25(OH)
D and CRP - a marker of CSU activity [20].

Lower 25(OH)D concentration may therefore appear as
a mere secondary phenomenon, manifested as a response
to different stimuli, including inflammation, and as such,
may not contribute in any way to pathogenesis of the disease. As chronic urticaria may be associated with lower
serum 25OHD concentration during the active period of
the disease, it would be interesting to recognize whether
such phenomenon is present shortly after the disease onset and after a long lasting remission, suggesting vitamin
D deficiency as a possible risk factor for CSU.

Interestingly, it has been reported that vitamin D metabolites regulate the synthesis of matrix metalloproteinases
(MMP) [21] and vitamin D insufficiency is associated with
the increased circulating levels of MMP9 and CRP [22],
suggesting a possible mechanism for tissue damage in
chronic inflammatory conditions, including CHD and diabetes [22]. On the other hand, it is known that both
MMP9 and CRP concentrations are elevated in CSU [23].
In our study we did not observe any significant association
between concentrations of 25(OH)D and CRP. Associations between vitamin D status and MMP9 overproduction in CSU should be established.

The limitations of this study included small sample
size and single assessment of 25 (OH)D concentration
performed in summer. Because serum 25(OH)D concentrations are lower in winter, it should be interesting to
compare the seasonal differences. Therefore, we cannot
exclude that prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency might be
higher following the summer season.

The serum 25(OH)D concentrations vary extensively
between studies and depend on different environmental
factors. Serum 25(OH)D concentration > 30 ng/ml is defined by most experts as optimal vitamin D status with
respect to maintenance of mineral homeostasis. So far,
immune-inflammatory consequences of vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency, assessed on the basis of 25(OH)D
concentrations alone, are unclear [17,18,24].

Clinical implications
Current data demonstrate the importance of screening for
vitamin D deficiency measured by serum concentration of

Page 4 of 5

25(OH)D in CSU patients. In addition, such observations
may have certain therapeutic implications. Interestingly, it
has been demonstrated that in patients suffering from
idiopathic chronic urticaria, isolated pruritus, and rash
with low 25(OH)D level, the symptoms resolution is often
possible with oral supplementation of vitamin D [15,25].

We speculate that treatment of vitamin D deficiency
would not only preserve mineral homeostasis but, due to
possible immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects
of vitamin D, might have a beneficial impact on CSU activity. Vitamin D supplementation may provide an important
and viable complement to the already existing CSU therapy. Higher doses of corticosteroids may be required in
therapy of patients with the immune-inflammatory diseases and concomitant vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency
[26]. In addition, the association was found between low
serum 25(OH)D concentration and the cardiovascular
mortality [27].

Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that vitamin D
insufficiency/deficiency promotes immune-inflammatory
response and exogenous vitamin D is able to diminish
activation of APR [9,24].

It seems important to know whether the anti-inflammatory
effects of exogenous vitamin D influence CSU activity.

Conclusions

CSU is associated with lower serum 25(OH)D concentration and higher prevalence of its deficiency. The results
failed to show any effect of vitamin D status on the circulating CRP concentrations in CSU. Taking into consideration that increased vitamin D intakes might reduce the
incidence and/or severity of immune-inflammatory disorders, the potential role of vitamin D in etiopathogenesis
and/or treatment of CSU calls for examination in other
cohorts of CSU patients as well as in larger studies.
