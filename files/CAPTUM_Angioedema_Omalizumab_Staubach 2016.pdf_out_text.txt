Abstract

Background: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) severely impacts quality of life
(QoL), especially in patients with wheals and angioedema. Omalizumab is
approved as add-on therapy for CSU patients; however, its effect on patients
who are double-positive for wheals and angioedema has not been systematically
studied.

Objective: The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of omalizumab vs
placebo at week 28 using the Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life (CU-Q2o0L) questionnaire. Number of angioedema-burdened days, time interval between successive angioedema episodes, disease activity, angioedema-specific and overall QoL
impairment were secondary objectives.

Methods: X-ACT was a phase II, randomized, double-blind study conducted in
24 centres (Germany), which selectively included CSU patients with angioedema
and wheals. Patients were randomized (1 : 1) to omalizumab 300 mg or placebo
(every 4 weeks up to week 24) (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01723072).
Results: Of the 91 patients randomized to omalizumab (n = 44) or placebo
(n = 47) at baseline, 68 completed the 28-week treatment phase (omalizumab, 35;
placebo, 33). Omalizumab was superior to placebo in improving CU-Q2oL scores
at week 28 (P < 0.001). There was a threefold improvement in angioedema-burdened days/week with omalizumab (0.3) vs placebo (1.1). The median time to first
recurrence of angioedema was 57-63 days with omalizumab and <5 days with
placebo. Omalizumab _ significantly improved angioedema-specific QoL
(P < 0.001). The adverse events reported are in line with the established safety
profile of omalizumab.

Conclusion: Omalizumab was an effective treatment option for patients with
moderate-to-severe CSU symptoms and angioedema unresponsive to high doses
of antihistamine treatment.

Effect of omalizumab on angioedema

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a disabling condition
with an estimated prevalence of 0.5% to 1% in the European
population (1). CSU, also previously referred to as chronic
idiopathic urticaria, is characterized by persistent itchy hives
and/or angioedema that recur for more than 6 weeks and a
duration of several years (1, 2). Angioedema is the rapid
swelling of subcutaneous, mucosa and submucosal tissue that
can appear anywhere on the body, including the face, and is
very frequently associated with urticaria (1, 2). Various independent studies have demonstrated that quality of life (QoL)
is severely affected in patients with CSU, primarily because
the symptoms impair daily living and social interactions. The
two major causes of this impairment are (i) the itch associated with wheals and (ii) angioedema, which can be very
painful and is present in up to 50% of patients (3). In addition, many CSU patients develop psychosomatic or psychiatric conditions such as anxiety, depression and somatoform
disorders, which add to their QoL impairment (4-6). QoL in
CSU patients has been shown to be at least as poor as or
worse than that in patients with other chronic skin disorders,
including psoriasis (7).

Omalizumab, an IgE-specific humanized monoclonal antibody, is approved for the treatment of CSU (in patients
212 years of age) and has been recommended as an add-on
therapy by the current EACCI/GA?LEN/EDF/WAO urticaria guideline for patients who show insufficient response to
up to four times the approved dose of second-generation (sg)
H,-antihistamines (7, 8). While the efficacy of omalizumab in
CSU patients is well established (9-13), the effects of omalizumab on disease-specific and symptom-specific QoL impairment have remained largely uninvestigated. In addition, no
omalizumab trial has specifically focussed on CSU patients
suffering from wheals and angioedema, who form a large
subpopulation of CSU.

Therefore, through the X-ACT (Xolair Effects on Angioedema in Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria Treatment) study,
we assessed the impact of omalizumab on the QoL of CSU
patients with angioedema and wheals refractory to high doses
of H,-antihistamines and evaluated in detail the effects of
omalizumab treatment on angioedema and impairment of
angioedema-specific QoL. The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of omalizumab vs placebo at week 28 by use
of the Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life (CU-Q:o0L) questionnaire. Number of angioedema-burdened days, time interval between successive angioedema episodes, disease activity,
angioedema-specific and overall QoL impairment were secondary objectives.

Methodology
Study design and patients

X-ACT was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicentre study with a 28-week treatment period
and an 8-week follow-up. The study was conducted
between January 2013 and May 2014 in 24 centres in Germany. Patients with CSU aged 18-75 years, with wheals
and at least four occurrences of angioedema in the last

Staubach et al.

6 months, who were symptomatic despite high-dose sg H,antihistamine treatment (two to four times the approved
dose), were eligible to participate in the study. Inclusion
was limited to patients with weekly Urticaria Activity
Score (UAS7) of =14 and a Chronic Urticaria Quality of
Life Questionnaire (CU-Qo0L) score 230 at baseline
(Appendix Protocol).

The key exclusion criteria were as follows: patients with
non-urticaria-associated angioedema (e.g. Cl-inhibitor deficiency), receiving Hy,-antihistamines at greater than four
times the approved dose within 3 days prior to day — 14;
patients with serious psychological disturbances, metabolic
and pathological conditions, history of malignancy or hypersensitivity to omalizumab; or treatment with omalizumab
within the previous 6 months. Systemic corticosteroids,
hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide or
intravenous immunoglobulin were not allowed 30 days prior
to day — 14; use of H>-antihistamines or leukotriene antagonists (montelukast or zafirlukast) was not allowed 7 days
prior to day — 14. Pregnant women and/or women who were
breastfeeding were excluded from the study (Appendix).
Angioedema in CSU patients, as diagnosed in accordance
with the EACCI/GA?LEN/EDF/WAO urticaria guideline,
excludes ACE/inflammatory drugs as the probable reason for
angioedema. All cases of angioedema associated with Clinhibitor deficiency were excluded; hence, for all included
patients, there were normal Cl-inhibitor levels at screening.

The study protocol was approved by an independent ethics
committee or institutional review board for all study centres
in Germany. The study was designed and conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation
(ICH) Harmonised Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical
Practice. All patients provided written informed consent prior
to study initiation (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01723072;
EudraCT number: 2011-004254-25).

Randomization and masking

After a 2-week screening period, patients were randomly
assigned (1: 1) to either omalizumab or placebo groups by
protocol. A validated automated system was used for the
assignment of treatment arms to randomization numbers in
the specified ratio.

During the treatment phase (day | to day 197), two subcutaneous injections of omalizumab (150mg x 2) or
placebo were administered every 4 weeks until week 24
(seven doses of two injections each, adding up to 14 injections) as add-on therapy to the daily intake of high doses
(two to four times the approved dose) of sg Hy-antihistamines. This was followed by an 8-week follow-up period
(day 198 to day 253). The use of concomitant treatment
with sg H,-antihistamines was defined during the screening
phase for each individual patient and was administered on
a daily basis throughout the treatment and follow-up
phases. Additional rescue medication was provided [three
tablets of clemastine per day (maximum 3 days per week)
and 15mg _ betamethasone in case of life-threatening
angioedema development].

Outcomes

The primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline to
week 28 of the CU-Q:oL total scores. Key secondary endpoints were the number of angioedema-burdened days per
week, number and size of angioedema episodes, time interval
between successive angioedema episodes, disease activity and
angioedema-specific and overall QoL impairment.

The efficacy outcomes were measured using the following:
(i) CU-Q30L — this questionnaire measures various aspects of
QoL (scale: 0-100; high scores indicate low QoL) that are
specific to chronic urticaria (14, 15); (ii) Angioedema Quality
of Life Questionnaire (AE-QoL) — this symptom-specific QoL
questionnaire measures four dimensions with a total of 17
items (16), and the lower the score, the better the QoL (scale:
0-100); (iii) Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) — this
validated tool measures overall QoL related to the skin (17);
it consists of 10 items, measuring six dimensions of healthrelated QoL, and the lower the score, the better the QoL
(scale: 0-30); (iv) number of angioedema-burdened days —
this assessment was based on records from the patient’s daily
diary [i.e. first question of the Angioedema Activity Score
(AAS) assessment] per week, where patient reported the
number of angioedema suffering as well as the severity of the
episode; (v) time to first recurrence of angioedema episode —
first angioedema episode after last injection of the study
drug; (vi) size of angioedema — acute swelling episodes were
measured using a paper-based patient daily dairy for both
placebo and omalizumab groups; (vii) AAS — this symptomspecific score is based on data recorded by patients with the
help of a daily diary; it consists of the daily question ‘Have
you had a swelling episode in the last 24 h?’ and five additional questions if a swelling episode had occurred (week
sum score: 0-105); higher scores represent severe disease
activity (18); and (viii) UAS7 — this diary-based validated
tool assesses the CSU symptoms of itch (severity) and hives
(numbers) over a period of 7 days (19); higher scores indicate
severe disease activity (scale: 0-42).

Statistical analysis

All efficacy results presented here are based on the full analysis set (FAS), that is all randomized subjects who received at
least one dose of study drug. Subjects were analysed according to the treatment to which they were randomized. For
patients who discontinued the trial early, the last observed
value [last observation carried forward (LOCF)] was used for
the primary endpoint.

The primary analysis was performed comparing treatments
with respect to the primary efficacy variable in an analysis of
covariance (ANCovA) model with the factors treatment, centre
and baseline score as covariates. The raw and the adjusted
(least square, LS) group means were presented. Additionally,
two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) and the P-value
from the F-test were provided. The secondary endpoints,
time to first angioedema episode and time to first recurrence
were graphically displayed as Kaplan—Meier plots; patients
without episodes/recurrence were censored at their last study

visit. DLQI, AAS and UAS7 were analysed analogously.
Number of angioedema-burdened days, AE-QoL and DLQI
categories were analysed descriptively. Sensitivity analyses
were carried out using nonparametric methods.

Results
Study population

A total of 133 patients were screened, of whom 91 were randomized (42 patients failed the screening); 68 patients (omalizumab, 35; placebo, 33) completed the 28-week treatment
phase, and 23 patients discontinued (omalizumab, nine; placebo, 14) (Fig. 1). Overall, 35 of the 44 patients in the omalizumab group (79.5%) and 29 of the 47 patients in the
placebo group (61.7%) received all seven doses as planned in
the protocol (Table S1), and 33 (75.0%) patients in the omalizumab group and 26 (55.3%) in the placebo group completed the follow-up period. There were no relevant
imbalances between the study groups with respect to demographic and baseline disease characteristics, except for the
number of swelling episodes, which was lower in the omalizumab group (231 attacks in 44 patients) than in the placebo
group (325 attacks in 47 patients). The mean (SD) age was
42.9 (12.3) years and 69.2% of patients were female
(Table 1). Of the patients who discontinued, two withdrew
consent with no further information, one withdrew consent
after 1 month as the study medication did not seem to work,
two withdrew consent as they did not experience an effect
after 2 months of treatment, one experienced a pelvic fracture, one moved to another country, one attempted suicide
due to personal problems, and one wanted to try another
treatment prohibited by the protocol.

All enrolled patients had a history of angioedema with
approximately 60% experiencing daily or weekly angioedema
episodes. Approximately 85% of the study population experienced one or more episodes of periorbital or perioral angioedema and 67% reported angioedema of their hands.
Moreover, at baseline, 67% of patients were at least
occasionally afraid of a life-threatening swelling episode. Furthermore, 49% of patients were occasionally, often or very
often afraid that ‘they could suffocate due to a swelling episode’. Similarly, only 13% of enrolled patients stated at baseline that they ‘were not’ or ‘just a little’ worried about their
health and 54% stated that they were ‘a lot’ or ‘very much’
worried about their current health status. Baseline DLQI
scores indicated a large impact in approximately 80% of the
study population. Majority of the patients (90.1%) had been
treated with two or more different second-generation H)antihistamines, and 29% had received corticosteroids during
the 12 months prior to the beginning of the study.

Efficacy

Omalizumab was significantly superior to placebo in reducing
the CU-Q,oL total score from week 4 onwards over the
28 weeks of treatment (P < 0.001 at all measurement points,
Fig. 2). The treatment group difference (omalizumab minus
Effect of omalizumab on angioedema

placebo, LS mean [95% CI]) at week 4 and week 28 was
—20.7 points [—29.0, —12.5] and —21.5 points [—30.9, —12.1],
respectively (P < 0.001). At week 28, the improvement in the
mean total CU-Q,oL total score was greater in the omalizumab compared with the placebo group (60% vs 20%,
respectively, P < 0.001). At the end of the follow-up period
(week 36; 12 weeks after the last injection of study medication), the mean total CU-Q,oL score had increased (Figure Sl); however, on average, the absolute change still
showed a treatment effect with omalizumab (—23.9 + 23.0)
compared with placebo (—14.7 + 19) (P < 0.001). Angioedema-specific QoL, as assessed by the AE-QoL, showed significant improvement in patients on omalizumab vs placebo
at week 4 as well as at week 28 (—26.5 vs —10.3 and —41.4
vs —24.2, respectively) (P < 0.001). Omalizumab was also
superior to placebo in reducing the DLQI total score over
28 weeks of treatment (—10.5 vs —5.6, P< 0.001). Here,
again, superiority was reached by the week 4 and was maintained throughout the treatment period. In patients receiving
omalizumab, there was no significant difference in the change
in CU-Q,oL total scores from baseline to week 28 between
patients with BMI <25 or BMI>25 (—33.25, BMI< 25 vs
—34.56, BMI >25; P = 0.2328).

Staubach et al.

The mean number of angioedema-burdened days in the
omalizumab group (14.6 + 19.5 days; median, 9 days) during
the 28-week treatment period was lower than that in the placebo group [49.5 + 50.8 days; median, 30 days (Fig. 3A)];
this corresponds to a median of 0.3 angioedema-burdened
days per week in the omalizumab vs 1.1 days in the placebo
group, a threefold improvement with omalizumab. During
the follow-up period, the mean number of angioedema-burdened days was lower in omalizumab (n = 33, 5.8 + 9.1,
median 2.0 days) compared with that in the placebo group
(n = 30, 12.8 + 16.2, median 7.5 days).

In the omalizumab group, the estimated probability for the
first angioedema event was 0.705 at week 4, 0.756 at week 28
(the end of the treatment period) and 0.892 at week 36 (the
end of the follow-up period). In the placebo group, the probability for the first event was 0.957 at week 4 and 0.979 at
week 28 and week 36. The median time to first angioedema
episode was 4 days in the omalizumab group and <2 days in
the placebo group (Fig. 3B).

The median time to first recurrence of an angioedema episode (after the last injection of study drug) was 57-63 days
in the omalizumab group as compared to <5 days in the
placebo group. In the omalizumab group, the cumulative

swellings (20 cm) in the omalizumab and placebo group,
respectively. During the last 4 weeks of treatment, this distribution had virtually not changed in the placebo group,
whereas no medium or large swellings occurred in the
omalizumab-treated group (Fig. 4).

Omalizumab significantly reduced AAS scores as early as
4 weeks after the start of treatment (baseline) and over the
entire treatment period compared with placebo (P < 0.001;
Fig. 5A). At week 28, the mean change from baseline in
AAS scores was —20.6 (+21.5) for omalizumab and —10.8
(+£21.3) for placebo (P = 0.036; 95% CI, —18.9, —0.7). Omalizumab was significantly superior to placebo in reducing the
UAS7 total score over 28 weeks of treatment (Fig. 5B). At
week 28, the mean change from baseline of UAS7 was —16.8
(+14.8) for the omalizumab group and —6.5 (+£13.4) for the
placebo group (Diff. = 10.3; 95% CI -16.2, —3.9;
P = 0.002). By the end of weeks 12 and 28, the number of
patients showing complete response (UAS7 = 0) was higher
in the omalizumab group (week 12: 18 of 44; week 28: 22 of
44) than in the placebo group (week 12: 3 of 47; week 28: 5
of 47).

Patients were analysed for the effects of omalizumab treatment on weekly itch score and weekly wheal score; at week
12, omalizumab (—8.3 + 7.58) was more effective in reducing
weekly itch score vs placebo (—2.2 + 8.99). In omalizumab
group, weekly wheal score was also reduced compared with
placebo (—8.1 + 9.32 vs —2.1 + 9.43).

Safety

During treatment weeks 1 through 12, 30 (68.2%) of 44
patients and 34 (72.3%) of 47 patients reported one or more
AE in the omalizumab and placebo groups, respectively. Six
patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) in the
study: four (9.1%) in the omalizumab group and two (4.3%)
in the placebo group. None of the SAEs were suspected to
be clinically related to the study treatment and no death
occurred during the study (Table $2). Seven patients (15.9%)
in the omalizumab group and 17 patients (36.2%) in the placebo group required systemic corticosteroid administration
during the study.

Discussions

X-ACT is the first study to specifically evaluate omalizumab
treatment efficacy in patients with CSU whose symptoms of
angioedema are not controlled by high doses (four times the
approved dose) of second-generation H,-antihistamines. This
represents a large subgroup amongst patients with CSU who
are severely affected, as demonstrated by their CU-Q,oL,
AE-QoL and DLQI scores. Our findings show that
omalizumab can statistically improve QoL in this patient
population.

The frequency of angioedema episodes in our study population at baseline was high and unexpected. Published literature estimates that patients with angioedema comprise up to
50% of the overall population of patients with CSU (18).
However, information on the frequency and impact of

angioedema in these patients is limited. At the start of the
study, when patients were asked whether they ‘were afraid of
a life-threatening swelling episode’, 67% of them replied that
this was the case ‘occasionally’, ‘often’ or ‘very often’. Of
more concern was the observation that 49% of the patients
said they were ‘occasionally’, ‘often’ or ‘very often’ afraid
that ‘they could suffocate due to a swelling episode’, emphasizing the gravity of disease burden. The disease severity was
also shown by the mean CU-Q,o0L total score of >50 at
screening.

Results from the X-ACT study confirm the rapid onset
of action and efficacy of omalizumab 300 mg in CSU
patients (also in angioedema affected patients), similar to
previous findings from clinical studies (10, 11) as well as
real-life survey (20). In the phase III study, GLACIAL,
CU-Q,oL was an exploratory endpoint and the scores were
only available for a subset of patients (11); at week 12,
the difference in change from baseline between omalizumab
300 mg (—29.3) and placebo (—16.3) was —13.4. In comparison, the difference at week 12 between omalizumab
300 mg (—34.2) and placebo (—12.5) was —22.2 in the XACT study. Both the results were statistically significant,
favouring omalizumab.

There was a significant improvement in AE-QoL with omalizumab, again from week 4 onwards, consistent with DLQI
scores. Improvements in the DLQI scores in our study population were also consistent with that in the ASTERIA and GLACIAL studies (10-12). Now, with the results of the X-ACT
study, it may be interesting to look at these different populations and probe more into the disease expression in CSU.

Angioedema imparts a serious burden on the QoL of CSU
patients. Previous studies have shown the positive effect of
omalizumab in reducing the number of angioedema-burdened

carried forward (LOCF) was used for missing values. ancova model:

days, measured as ‘angioedema-free days’ (10, 11). In the XACT study, this was measured as angioedema-burdened
days, and hence, a direct comparison between the studies
becomes difficult. In the X-ACT study, we also measured the
time to recurrence of angioedema episodes as this is an
important aspect of determining the QoL with any treatment.
The estimated probability of recurrence of angioedema episodes with placebo was faster than with omalizumab
(< 5 days vs 57-63 days). These results are in alignment with
the results of other secondary endpoints. It is also of clinical
significance to note the reduction in the size of the angioedema swelling with omalizumab, even when an event
occurred, suggesting this as an additional parameter in evaluating efficacy in clinical studies. X-ACT study showed that
the omalizumab 300 mg treatment not only changes the
number of angioedema attacks, but also reduces the swelling
size and episodes in these second-generation H,-antihistamine
refractory patients.

In earlier studies, the decrease in severity of CSU directly
correlates with the improvement in QoL; a similar correlation
was observed between CSU disease severity and QoL
improvement in our study. The improvement in AAS scores
with omalizumab was twofold when compared with placebo,
and the improvement in UAS7 scores in the omalizumab
group (—16.8 points) at week 28 was close to 3 times that of
the placebo group (—6.5 points). The mean change from
baseline UAS7 score in our study seems to be slightly less,
comparable to the results of the ASTERIA I (—20.8 at week
12) (12), ASTERIA II (—21.7 at week 12) (10) and GLACIAL (—19.0 at week 12)!! studies. However, when the placebo response is also considered together with actual UAS7,
the results seem to be comparable. In the GLACIAL study,
the UAS7 at week 12 with omalizumab was —19.0 (baseline,

was similar to that in the X-ACT study at week 12 with
omalizumab at —16.4 (baseline, 26.5) and with placebo at
—4.4 (baseline, 27.9).

The event pattern and the intensity of the AEs reported in
the omalizumab group are in line with its established safety
profile and do not indicate any new concerns or undue safety
risks with omalizumab in the treatment of patients with CSU

dema episodes, and the typical itchy hive symptoms. Therefore, for the existing but small patient population presenting
only with angioedema (without hives), no valuable data could
be generated. The sample size of 91 patients could be considered small (only 33 and 26 patients in the omalizumab and placebo groups completed the study), although this was
adequately powered for the planned statistical analyses.
Because this was the first study that specifically looked at treatment efficacy in the population of patients with angioedema
(refractory to high doses of H,-antihistamines), interpretation
of these results may form the basis for future studies in the so
far hardly described ‘angioedema only’ subpopulation.

The X-ACT study demonstrated omalizumab to be an
effective treatment option for patients with moderate-tosevere CSU symptoms and angioedema burden who remain
symptomatic despite high doses of H,-antihistamines. There
was a rapid reduction in the number of angioedema-burdened days and in the size of involved areas. The time to first
recurrence of angioedema was prolonged with omalizumab,
corresponding to a significant improvement in the QoL. The
results of the X-ACT study may pave the way to further
investigate QoL in CSU patients with wheals and angioedema, as well as to explore treatment options to better
manage this population.
