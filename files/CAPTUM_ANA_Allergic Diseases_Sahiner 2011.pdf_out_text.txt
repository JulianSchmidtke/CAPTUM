Abstract

Background: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in childhood is infrequent, and information about the disease in
children is limited. We attempted to investigate its etiologic
factors, natural course, and predictors of prognosis. Methods: All children aged <18 years followed for CSU during an
8-year period were analyzed retrospectively, and the final
outcomes were queried via a telephone interview. Results:
One hundred patients (male/female ratio 1.27) with a median age of 9.2 years (range 0.7-17.2) at symptoms onset were
evaluated. The median follow-up was 2.5 years (range 0.218.1). An autologous serum skin test was positive in 46.7% of
the subjects (n = 45), with a female predominance (71.4%)
(p = 0.023). In 13.8% of the children, ANA titers were over
1/100. Food allergy (n = 1), thyroid autoantibodies (n = 3),
possible collagen disease (n = 1), and drug usage (deferoxamine) (n= 1) were found to be associated factors. Infections
could not be confirmed as the cause of CSU. Recovery was
seen in 16.5, 38.8, and 50.0% of the children after 12, 36, and
60 months, respectively. Though in multivariate analysis
none of the factors, including age, gender, autologous serum skin test positivity, the presence of angioedema, or oth
er allergic diseases, appeared to predict the prognosis, in
univariate analysis being female and being older than 10
years of age predicted an unfavorable prognosis. Conclusion: The etiology of CSU in children is mainly related to an
autoreactive background, as in adults. CSU has a favorable
prognosis, and resolution is seen in half of the children within 5 years. Girls older than 10 years may have an unfavorable

prognosis. Copyright © 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel

Introduction

Urticaria is a common entity affecting 15-25% of the
population with at least 1 episode in their lifetime [1]. It
is divided into acute and chronic forms, with chronic urticaria (CU) defined as the presence of hives for more
than 6 weeks. CU in children is generally known to be less
common than in adults, affecting 0.1-3.0% of children
[2], and it can be physical, spontaneous, or of a different
nature. Physical urticaria is triggered by a specific physical stimulus and includes cold urticaria, solar urticaria,
delayed pressure urticaria, localized heat urticaria, dermagraphic urticaria, and vibration urticaria. Chronic

This study was presented at the EAACI 2010 Congress in London
(p511) with a slightly different conclusion because of the addition of
new patients and an extra analysis.

spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is defined as the daily or almost daily occurrence of wheals for more than 6 weeks
after the exclusion of physical urticaria and other urticaria types [3]. In contrast to the ease of its diagnosis, it
is difficult to diagnose the etiologic factors responsible
for CSU, and there are limited studies in children with
CSU [4-7]. Reports of success in identifying a cause for
CU in children (including physical urticaria in the classification of CU) range from 21 to 83% [5, 8]. In these
studies, several etiologic factors were identified as possible causes, such as chronic infections, parasites, food allergies, and collagen vascular diseases [4~8]. In addition,
recent publications have shown that in 30-50% of patients with CSU, the disease process is related to an autoimmune process with the presence of an immunoglobulin (Ig)G type autoantibody against either the high affinity receptor FCERIa or IgE [9-11]. An autologous serum
skin test (ASST) is used to screen for autoimmune pathology; however, it is regarded as a test for autoreactivity
rather than a specific test for autoimmune urticaria.
ASST has moderate specificity as a marker for functional
autoantibodies against IgE or the high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI), and it has a high negative predictive
value for CU patients without them compared with the
basophil histamine release test (BHRT), the gold standard for autoimmune pathology in urticaria [12, 13].

Knowledge about the natural course of CU is important to inform parents regarding their prognosis and for
assessment of the social and economic burden of the disease. CU can cause significant morbidity in the form of
school absences, low school performance, and poor quality of life, and patients rely heavily upon healthcare services compared to patients with other allergic diseases
[14]. However, information about the natural course of
the disease is drawn mainly from adult studies [15-17],
and there is little information available regarding children [4, 18, 19].

In the present study, we attempted to document the
etiologic factors and natural course of CU in children.

Patients and Methods

Patients

The study was performed in the outpatient clinic of the Pediatric Allergy and Asthma Unit of Hacettepe University Ihsan
Dogramaci Children’s Hospital, which is the largest pediatric asthma outpatient clinic in the country. While the clinic serves as a
referral center for the entire country, patients may also be admitted
upon request; thus, it functions as both a primary and tertiary
health care service. The medical records of the patients who attended our clinic and were diagnosed with CU between January 1,

 

CU in Children

2002 and December 31, 2009 were evaluated retrospectively. Histories, physical findings, and diagnostic tests were all retrieved
from the patients’ medical records. A total of 113 files were evaluated. One and 12 files were excluded from the study because of
insufficient data and the diagnosis of physical urticaria, respectively, and finally 100 patients with CSU were analyzed in the
study. A database was formed and each patient was then contacted
by telephone to inquire regarding their current disease status. All
of the patients were reached by telephone by the third attempt. Ifa
patient had been free of urticarial symptoms for at least 6 months,
he/she was considered to be in remission. Reappearance of the
symptoms after remission was considered relapse of the disease [4].

Laboratory Investigations

Laboratory investigations included a complete blood count,
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP),
anti-streptolysin O (ASO), Helicobacter pylori IgG antibody, hepatitis markers, complement levels including C3 and C4, total IgE
levels, antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (anti-DNA), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH),
free T4, anti-thyroid peroxisomal antibody, anti-thyroglobulin
antibody, a purified protein derivative (PPD) test, urine analysis,
a stool examination for parasites, and throat and urine cultures.

 

 

Skin Test Procedures

All participants presenting with a history of CU were skin
prick tested (SPT) for Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, Alternaria, cat, grass mix (Phleum pratense,
Poa pratensis, Dactylis glomerata, Lolium perenne, Festuca pratensis, and Avena elatior), tree mix (Betula verrucosa, Alnus glutinosa, and Corylus avellana), Olea europaea, horse dander, Blattella germanica, wheat, peanut, hazelnut, egg white, egg yolk, soya
and cow’s milk, and histamine (10 mg/ml of histamine phosphate)
as positive subjects and 0.9% sterile saline as negative controls.
The SPT was considered positive if the mean wheal diameter was
2=3 mm compared with the negative control. A positive SPT was
taken as evidence of the presence of atopy in that patient.

In the case of suspicion of food allergy, an open food challenge
was performed followed by either a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge or an elimination diet.

In 45 of the patients (informed consent was received from patients and parents) an ASST was performed using an intradermal
skin test with 0.05 ml of sterile, fresh autologous serum as well as
10 pg/ml histamine and 0.9% sterile saline as positive and negative controls, respectively. Thirty minutes after the intradermal
injection of serum, wheal and flare reactions were measured and
a wheal diameter of =1.5 mm when compared with a control saline solution was considered positive [11].

Statistics

Results were expressed as medians (ranges); groups were compared using the Student t test or Pearson’s x’ test for differences.
For prognosis, Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were
used, and recovery curves were compared with a logrank test. Statistical analyses included univariate and multivariate analyses,
and odds ratios (ORs) with relevant 95% confidence intervals
(Cls) were calculated for evaluating the potential associations between various predictors and CU. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using the SPSS
16.0 software program (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill., USA).

Results

A total of 100 patients (56 male and 44 female) were
evaluated for the study with a median age during symptoms onset of 9.2 years (range 0.7-17.2). The median age
at admission, the current age, and the median follow-up
durations and their ranges were 10.3 years (2.1-17.6), 13.6
years (3.9-22.5) and 2.5 years (0.2-18.1), respectively. The
frequencies of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic eczema were 10.1, 7.1, and 2.0%, respectively. Characteristics
of the patients are shown in table 1.

An ASST was performed in 45 children (male/female
ratio 0.87) and was positive in 21/45 (46.7%) of the patients (male/female ratio 0.40). Most of the patients with
ASST positivity were female 71.4% (p = 0.023) (table 2).
ASST results were not associated with ANA positivity
and/or high levels of ESR or CRP (p > 0.05).

Thirty-two out of 98 patients had atopy. The numbers
of patients sensitized were 18, 5, 4, and 4 for grass mix/
tree mix, house dust mite, grass mix and house dust mite,
and grass mix and cat, respectively. Only 1 of the patients
showed food allergy (cow’s milk) confirmed with an open
oral challenge, and symptoms disappeared after the removal of cow’s milk from the diet. Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies were positive in 3 of 82 (3.7%) patients.
One of these patients was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s
thyroiditis. High antinuclear antibody titers (>1/100)
were found in 13/94 (13.8%) patients, and 1 of them presented with persistent arthralgia. Abnormal laboratory
results are shown in table 3. With the combination of case
histories, physical examinations, laboratory results, and
challenges, we determined that CU in our study group
was associated with an autoreactive pathology in 46.7%

months, respectively. The same analysis was performed
concerning gender, age groups (<10 years and =10 years),
and ASST results (fig. 1). The median recovery time was
4.0 years for boys and 5.8 years for girls; however, the results were not statistically significant (p = 0.351). The median recovery times for the children with CU and <10
years of age compared to those with CU and =10 years
of age were 4.59 and 5.0 years, respectively (p = 0.218).
There was also no difference in prognosis with respect to
the ASST results (p = 0.762).

Risk analysis regarding the prognosis was performed
with univariate and multivariate analyses and group
comparisons with the independent samples t test or Pearson’s x’ test for differences between the groups. In Cox
regression analysis, none of the factors, including age,
gender, abnormal laboratory results, ASST positivity, a
family history of autoimmunity, or the presence of angioedema or other allergic diseases, appeared to predict the
prognosis in children with CU. However, when we com

bined the 2 risk factors (being a girl and being older than
10 years) and made a comparison with the remaining
group, an unfavorable prognosis appeared for 3-5 years
of prognosis in univariate analysis (OR = 9.75, 95% CI =
1.21-78.32; p = 0.016 and OR = 8.40, 95% CI = 1.76-39.92;
p = 0.004, respectively). However, it did not reach statistical significance in the multivariate logistic regression
analysis, possibly due to a low number of subjects in the
groups.

Discussion

In the present study, we found that the etiology of CSU
in children is mainly related to an autoreactive backgroundas nearly half of the children tested with the ASST
showed positivity. In contrast to acute urticaria, CSU is
not frequently related to infections (bacterial, viral, and
parasitic). Thyroid diseases do not appear to be an imporant bystander as is the case in adults. CSU has a favorable
prognosis and half of the children with CSU recover
without any relapse. Although in univariate analysis the
coexistence of female gender and being older than 10
years of age appears to predict a poor prognosis, in mulivariate analysis none of the risk factors (or any of their
combinations) such as demographic characteristics, atopy, family history, and the presence of an allergic disease
or laboratory abnormalities predicted the prognosis.

It is difficult to compare and discuss the etiologic fac‘ors responsible for CSU in children with the available
related literature because of the lack of standardization.
Variations in the rates of specific etiology reported in the
previous studies are mainly due to the different criteria
for the confirmation of suspected etiologies as well as the
different populations studied. CSU is known to be predominant in females in different studies [7, 8, 14]. However, in the present study, as in the study by Volonakis et
al. [5], males were predominant in the CSU group (56%).
The frequencies of allergic diseases and atopy in the patients did not differ from those in the general Turkish
population, and atopy was not associated with CSU,
which suggests that atopy is not related to CSU [20].

Studies concerning the autoimmune nature of CSU
discuss mainly adult populations [10, 21, 22]. In children,
the number of studies concerning the autoimmune nature of CSU is limited and ranges between 30 and 40% for
CSU [7, 12]. In the present study, a 46.7% ASST positivity
was found. Our result is comparable with those of previous studies because we excluded the physical urticaria
cases from the study group. One can speculate that the

ASST is not a confirmatory test and does not show the
autoantibodies but instead reflects that serum is able to
induce histamine release from skin mast cells without
knowledge of whether it is triggered by autoantibodies
[23]. It is true, however, that ASST is a cheap, easy-toperform, and practical method to diagnose the autoreactive nature of urticaria; it has a good sensitivity and an
even better specificity compared to the BHRT, especially
in developing countries where the BHRT is not available
[12]. We think that children with ASST positivity should
be followed for the development of new autoimmune diseases.

Thyroid pathology as a causative factor in CSU patients in based mainly on adult studies, and percentages
as high as 25% have been reported [24, 25]. However, in
studies in children, thyroid pathology does not appear to
bean important associated factor. Neither Harris et al. [4]
nor Volonakis et al. [5] mentioned thyroid abnormalities

 

228 Int Arch Allergy Immunol 2011;156:224-230

in their papers. In addition, in a recent study, Jirapongsananuruk et al. [7] reported 1 out of 94 patients with
thyroid autoimmunity. Levy et al. [26] evaluated 187 children with an age range of 7-17 years and found antithyroid antibody in 4.3%. In our study, we found that 3 children had antithyroid antibody positivity (3.7%); this result was similar to that from healthy Turkish children
(1.2%) observed in a previous study [27]. One of these
children was diagnosed with Hashimoto thyroiditis and
this patient recovered from CU after the treatment. We
think that children with ASST positivity should be
searched for the presence of thyroid pathologies as mentioned in a recent guideline by Konstantinou et al. [13].
ANA positivity was present in 13/94 (13.8%) patients.
One of them presented with persistent arthralgia. He is
now under follow-up for the risk of a collagen vascular
disease. Jirapongsananuruk et al. [7] showed an ANA
positivity rate of 23%, but only 2 patients had a titration

 

Sahiner/Civelek/Tuncer/Yavuz/
Karabulut/Sackesen/Sekerel
of over 1/160, and no collagen vascular disease was diagnosed. Harris et al. [4] found 2/94 CU patients to have
juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. In the case of ANA titers of
1/160 or over, it is important to follow patients for the development of systemic lupus erythematosus, whereas
high ANA titers have no diagnostic utility in the diagnosis of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis [28].

Harris et al. [4] reported that in relation to history, 27%
of children and/or parents considered food a causative
factor for CSU, but food allergy was found to be related
in only 2/94 (2.1%) of the children with CSU. Volonakis
et al. [5] showed 6/226 (2.7%) children with CSU to have
a related food allergy; Sackesen et al. [6] reported foodrelated urticaria cases (both acute and chronic) in 3/54
(5.5%) patients. We found 1 case of cow’s milk allergy related to CSU. Although it is reported frequently by families, food allergy does not seem to be a major cause in
children with CSU and should be confirmed by either an
elimination diet or oral challenge tests.

The arguments concerning infections as an important
causative factor for CSU are weak from an evidencebased viewpoint because variations in geographic regions, the kinds of settings, different diagnostic assessments, personal prejudices, and preconceived opinions of
the investigators all affect the results; however, there are
data suggesting a link [29]. Schuller [30] reported that infection, associated or not with drug intake, was defined
as a major cause of acute urticaria in children. This is not
the case in CSU patients, and infections are not as important as in acute urticaria. Infections were reported by
Harris et al. [4] in 2% of the children with CSU, while
Volonakis et al. [5] found a 1.3% association with infections. Our results were in agreement with these studies.
We found high ESR, CRP, ASO, and PPD positivity in a
number of patients, and throat and urine cultures were
positive in 3 of them (table 3). However, no causal relationship was determined between these results and the
clinical course of CSU since none of the patients recovered after the treatment of infections. We should mention
that the viral etiology was not explored in detail in our
study, and perhaps in a number of cases as reported previously from our center a viral causal relationship may be
documented [7].

H. pylori has been suggested as a possible cause for
CSU, but in most controlled prospective studies no relationship has been identified [31, 32]. The H. pylori serology positivity in our study was found to be less than that
in the healthy children population (9.7 vs. 41.7%) [33]. We
could not demonstrate a clinical correlation with CSU in
our 3 patients diagnosed with H. pylori infection. Parasites

 

CU in Children

are rare causes of CSU in children. Harris et al. [4] and
Sackesen et al. [6] did not report any case among 94 and
17 patients, respectively. Volonakis et al. [5] from Greece
reported a rate of parasitic infestation of only 2.7% among
226 children, and even in a tropical country Jirapongsananuruk et al. [7] found 5 parasitic infestations in 94
children with CSU but there was no clinical correlation.
In the present study, we found 2 patients with parasitic infestations and the urticaria persisted after the treatment.

Most of the information concerning the natural course
of CU comes from adult studies. In 330 adult patients, the
median duration of the symptoms with CU was between
2 and 4 years [34]. Quaranta et al. [15] found that the follow-up of 86 patients with CU for 3 years revealed a recovery rate of 56%. In another adult study with 153 patients, the recovery rates were 34 and 49% for 5 and 10
years, respectively [17]. There is little information available regarding children. Harris et al. [4] found a recovery
rate of 58% in 94 children with CU after a 1-year followup. Mortureux et al. [19] reported a recovery rate of 94.7%
in 57 children, most of whom had acute urticaria. Kauppinen et al. [18] reported a 47% recovery rate with a mean
follow-up of 3.8 years, with physical urticaria having the
worst prognosis. In our study, 1 out of 2 children were
symptom free within 5 years. This shows that CSU in
children has a favorable prognosis and that in half of the
children CSU resolves without any relapse. The recovery
rate seemed to be better for boys than girls and for children <10 years of age, but the results were not statistically significant. There was no difference with respect to
the ASST results in contrast to the data mentioned in the
EAACI/GA(2)LEN task force report. However, with a
larger study group, these results may reach statistical significance. As in adults female gender was defined as a risk
factor for poor prognosis [35], we considered being a female older than 10 years of age to be a risk factor and the
analysis showed that being a girl older than 10 years of
age may be a risk factor for a poor prognosis. However,
we were not able to show any other predictors for prognosis, including age, gender, abnormal laboratory results,
ASST positivity, a family history of autoimmunity, and
the presence of angioedema or other allergic diseases.

In conclusion, the etiology of CSU in children is mainly related to an autoimmune background, and nearly half
of the children who are tested show ASST positivity. In
children, infections, foods, and thyroid diseases did not
appear to be important causative factors for CSU. CSU
has a favorable prognosis, with disease resolution in half
of the children within 5 years, and being a girl older than
10 years of age may be related to a poor prognosis.
