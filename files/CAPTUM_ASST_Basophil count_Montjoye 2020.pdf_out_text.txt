Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is defined as the spontaneous occurrence of wheals and/or
angioedema daily or almost daily for more than 6 weeks. The pathogenesis of CSU has not been
fully established although it seems clear that different mechanisms are involved. Mast cells
have long been the key cells involved in CSU pathogenesis, however new evidence argues in
favor of the involvement of other cells, i.e. basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes and neutrophil.

as well as the involvement of cytokines, coagulation pathways and autoantibodies (A/ bs).
Autoimmune diseases, particularly autoimmune thyroiditis and thyroid AAb. s7e.2 more
prevalent in patients with CSU.(1, 2) Several AAbs have been associated with “SL IgG against
thyroperoxydase (TPO) or thyroglobuline (Tg),(1, 3) IgG against IgE 01 «.ga..1si high-affinity
IgE receptor (FceRIJ),(4, 5) and IgE directed against autoantigens, such as TPO or interleukin
24.(6, 7) Furthermore, some patients with CSU react to the intraa.m:1 injection of their own
serum resulting in a positive autologous serum skin test (ASS‘1) (8) Also in vitro tests (basophil
histamine release assays (BHRA) and basophil activati-a est (BAT)) showed that some CSU
serum factors are able to induce histamine rele+:e/basophil activation.(5, 9) The abovementioned factors, alone or combined, are ofter usec tv classify patients as autoimmune or non
autoimmune CSU.

In this prospective cohort of patier 's wit. CSU, we analyzed correlations between several
clinical and biological markers a.d tl eir associations with: (i) disease activity; (ii) response to
Hi-antihistamines; (iii) avtoi:2n~unity; (iii) ASST. We also analyzed biological parameter

modifications in patients with. CSU treated with omalizumab (anti-IgE treatment).

Materials and c‘he ds:

This pros,ect ve study was conducted from September 2013 to December 2018 in the
depa.tmer. of Dermatology of the Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc, in Brussels, Belgium.
Tue stady and data collection were conducted with the approval of the institutional ethical

committee. Informed consent was obtained from all patients.

Patient selection and clinical data collection

 

Ninety-five adults and adolescents (= 12 years old) with a diagnosis of CSU, confirmed by a

dermatologist according to the international Guideline 2013,(10) were included. Only patients
with active CSU were selected. Patients with pure chronic inducible urticaria or bradykininmediated angioedema were not included in the study. Upon enrolment, medical history,
including history of personal or familial atopy (asthma, atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis)

and autoimmune diseases, as well as previous and current treatments for CSU were recorded.

Using a validated tool, the Weekly Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7), assessed disease
activity.(10) Patients were asked to record their symptoms for seven consecutive days prior 1
day of inclusion. Patients were classified as follows: severe CSU (UAS7=28-42), rod rae
CSU (UAS7=16-27), mild CSU (UAS7=7-15), well-controlled CSU (UAS7=1-¢) aid ctch-and
wheals-free (UAS7=0).(11)

Response to Hi-antihistamines was also evaluated and assessed using ti. UAS7 over several
months. Patients were classified as follows: H1-antihistamines resr onc rs (UAS7 <7 with 1 to
4 tablets daily of H\-antihistamines); H)-antihistamines unres;> onders (UAS7 > 7 with 4 tablets

daily of Hi-antihistamines).

Disease duration was defined as the time from the tirs* onset of symptoms to day of inclusion.
Recurring episodes of CSU, defined as recu reuce of symptoms after at least 6 months of

spontaneous remission, were also recordea.

For ASST and blood analyses, p?t:n.‘< ~vere considered as untreated, if they had stopped H1antihistamines for at least 48 Fours (or longer, depending on drug activity of each molecule),(8)
anti-leukotrienes and H2-.nt.>istamines for at least 7 days, and corticosteroids or cyclosporine

A for at least 1 mont. and have never taken omalizumab before inclusion.

Autoimmunity a1 tologous serum skin test

 

Patien’s wei also classified according to their “autoimmune status”. Autoimmune status was
inferre 1 1n the case of a personal history of concomitant autoimmune disease or in the presence
ot .t least one type of AAbs (included IgG against Tg and TPO, anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA)
and rheumatoid factor (RF)). No autoimmunity was defined as the absence of concomitant

autoimmune disease and AAbs.

ASST was performed on 60 untreated patients by the intradermal injection of 50uL of the
patient’s own serum into the volar part of the forearm.(8) Prick tests with histamine and

intradermal injection of normal saline solution served as respectively positive and negative
controls. A positive test was defined as the appearance, within 30 minutes, of a red wheal with
a diameter of 1.5 mm or greater than the wheal produced by the injection of normal saline

solution. Patients were classified as either having a positive or a negative ASST.

Biological tests

Blood analyses include: complete blood count (CBC) with differential; platelet paramete s;
total IgE serum levels; thyroid function tests; serum levels of IgG against Tg and TPO; .\Ms ;
RF; C-reactive protein (CRP) serum levels; complement components (C3, C4): C1-.1hii itor;
classical complement pathways; protein electrophoresis; and D-dimer plasm 'evels. Titers
were considered positive if IgG anti-Tg >115 U/ml, IgG anti-TPO > 34 U/l, “GVA > 1:160,
and RF > 1:40. For basophil blood counts, the reference range often use 11. trom 0 to 200 or
300/ uL. As this range is very large and start from zero, we used a 1, te:ence mean for blood
basophil counts which was established by the department of Ctinicai Biology of the Cliniques

universitaires Saint-Luc based on healthy controls valv zs.

Omalizumab treatment

 

For 22 patients treated with omalizumab (7914.8, Novartis, Camberley, UK) at the initial
recommended dose of 300mg every 4 .9 * weeks,(12) blood tests were performed before

initiation and under omalizumab trea. net.

Patients were classified acccdi.g to their response to omalizumab treatment as follows:
complete responders if UAS7 was 0, partial responders if UAS7 fell by at least 10 points (but
UAS7#0), and nceu-.2syunders if UAS7 remained unchanged, rose, or fell by less than 10
points. Based on ‘in.2 to response, patients were classified as early responders, if their UAS7

fell by at 1 :ast 'U points after one month of treatment. Others were classified as late responders.

Stotist.-ai Analyses

48 some clinical or biological data may be missing for some patients, the number of patients
studied for each parameter is always indicated. Data for categorical variables are expressed as

frequencies followed in brackets by the number patients positive for this parameter over number

 

of patients studied, and for continuous variables as mean + standard deviation (SD) with
minimum and maximum values in brackets. The Pearson’s x? test was applied to compare

percentages of categorical variables. Mann-Whitney test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used to
compare continuous variables between categorical variables. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed
rank test was used to compare paired variables, such as values before initiation and under
omalizumab. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to calculate correlation between
continuous variables. In all tests, the level of significance was a two-sided P value of less than
0.05. All statistical analyses were performed and graphs created using SPSS software Version
24 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism Version 8 (GraphPad Software Inc., USA).

Results

Relevant patient data (Table 1)

 

Clinical data

This study included 95 patients with CSU, 68 women (71.6%) anu 27 ‘nen (28.4%). Mean age

 

at inclusion was 45 +16 years and mean duration of CSU was 4.747 years. Mean age of CSU

 

onset was 40+16 years. Angioedema was associatea w.‘h ;vheals in 66 patients (69.5%).
Recurring episodes of CSU after at least 6 months e+ symptom free intervals without treatment
were reported in 25.3% of patients (23/91). 58 274 (4/95) were Hi-antihistamines responders
and 41.1% (39/95) were H\-antihistamines u. res,onders. Concerning disease activity based on
UAS7, 24 patients (40.7%) have severe u:sease, 10 patients (16.9%) have moderate disease, 17
patients (28.8%) have mild disexzse, 3 patients (5.1%) have well-controlled disease and 5
patients (8.5%) were itch-and wne.'s-free. ASST was performed on 60 patients and 24 (40%)

were positive.

Biological paramcie.s

Biological i2s.> that could be influenced by treatment (e.g: cell blood counts, platelet
parame vers, D-dimer plasma levels, IgE and CRP serum levels, complement components) were
analysoa only in untreated patients. Mean serum IgE levels was 208.2+451.8 kU/L, with 43.7%
(31/71) of patients having levels higher than 150 kU/L and 23.9% (17/71) having levels lower
than 40 kU/L. Mean D-dimer plasma levels was 1278.2 + 1939 ng/ml, with 56.3% (40/71) of
patients having levels higher than 500 ng/ml. For both IgE and D-dimer levels, the mean values
observed were higher than normal ranges and large variability was seen across patients. Blood

basophil counts were lower in patients with CSU (30.1424 /uL (74 patients) compared with
reference mean of healthy controls (40.0£17.3 /uL) (p=0.019). No significant abnormalities

were found in the rest of the CBC, in protein electrophoresis, nor in complement.

Associations with autoimmune disease, autoimmune serology or atopy

One third of the patients (32/94, 34.0%) had clinical history and/or serological markers of
autoimmunity, and therefore were considered as having a positive autoimmune status. Inde. 1,
a concomitant autoimmune disease was present in 18.3% (17/93) of patients, mainly thyrviant >
(11/17), and AAbs were present in 30.5% (29/95), predominately anti-TPO (20/92). As well,
familial history of autoimmune disease was found in 14,6% of cases (13/89). Nva-ly half of the

patients (45/91, 49.5%) had a personal history of atopy (based on anamnsis).

Correlations between disease activity, response to H1-antihistamine. 11.4 Jlinical or biological

 

parameters

Response to Hi-antihistamines was not correlated with .'in.-al parameters such as angioedema,
symptomatic dermographism, duration of the disea: >. age, weight, gender, personal or family
history of atopy. In addition, no association was 4 1.4 oetween Hi-antihistamines response and
concomitant autoimmune disease, presence ot Abs, the positivity of ASST nor blood cell

counts or total IgE serum levels.

Conversely, in H;-antihistamines ‘nr sponders, CRP serum levels (p<0.0001) (Fig. 1A) and Ddimer plasma levels (p=0.994 (Fig. 1B) were significantly higher than in H)-antihistamines
responders. Moreover CRF srum levels and D-dimer plasma levels were positively correlated

(p<0.0001).

Disease ac‘: vit, (based on UAS7) was positively correlated to CRP serum levels (p=0.033)
(Fig. 1©) auc negatively correlated to blood basophil counts (p=0.023) (Fig. 1D). Correlation
betwe.n W-dimer plasma levels and UAS7 did not reach significance (p=0.069).

Disease activity was not associated with clinical parameters nor with the rest of CBC values,

total IgE serum level nor with platelet parameters.

Correlation between autoimmune or autoreactive factors and biological parameters

 

An association between positive ASST results and autoimmune status (defined as the presence

of concomitant autoimmune disease and/or AAbs) was observed (p=0.037).
Positivity of ASST was correlated with angioedema (p=0.005) as 87.5% (21/24) of patients
with positive ASST had angioedema in contrast to 52.8% (19/36) with negative ASST.

Blood basophil counts (Fig. 2A), blood monocyte counts, and mean total IgE serum levels (Fig.
2B) were lower in patients with positive ASST (respectively p=0.001, p=0.019 and p=0.016).

However, other clinical and biological parameters were not correlated with ASST results.

D-dimer plasma levels were higher (p=0.016) (Fig. 2C) and blood basophil counts tow. +
(p=0.057) (Fig. 2D) when an autoimmune status was present. Blood platelet co mts and
plateletcrit were also higher in patients with autoimmune status (respective, 0-9.J10 and

p=0.002). Other clinical and biological parameters were not correlated w:th av.‘o.~.mune status.

Omalizumab: before initiation and under treatment

 

For 22 patients, biological parameters were compared before 1..itiation and under omalizumab.
11 patients were complete responders, 8 partial .<sponcers and 3 non-responders to
omalizumab. Among responders, 17 patients were - arly responders and 2 were late ones. All
data concerning patients before initiation and urc2cr s~™alizumab treatment are reported in Table

2.

Significant reductions in CRP serum le vels ‘n=0.0038) and D-dimer plasma levels (p=0.0002)
were observed under omalizun ab reatment, whereas increases were observed in blood
basophil counts (p=0.0023) (“ig 3) and total IgE serum levels (p=0.0007). Blood basophil

counts increased after oma’'z.mab in 13/19 patients, with a mean increase of 113% (20-200%).

No differences “01 the rest of CBC and platelet parameters were observed.

Neither _c.‘nical, nor biological parameters (including ratio of these parameters under
omai'zum:?o and before initiation) were associated with omalizumab response or with delay of
.oSsperse. However, the number of patients in each group was insufficient to have a statistically

s‘gnificant analysis.

Discussion

Since nearly 30 years, several lines of evidence argue for an autoimmune basis of CSU, or at
least in a subgroup of them. However, the way to distinguish autoimmune and non-autoimmune

CSU is still a matter of debate.(13, 14) In this study, we focused on correlations between several
biological parameters, concomitant autoimmune disease and/or presence of AAbs (included

IgG anti-Tg, IgG-TPO, ANA and RF) and positivity of ASST.

We found a relatively high incidence of autoimmune disorders and AAbs (autoimmune
status) in patients with CSU. One third of the patients had concomitant autoimmune disease
and/or AAbs, mainly autoimmune thyroiditis and IgG against TPO. Moreover a familial histo. y

of autoimmune disease was also found in 14,6% of patients. Recently, Schoepke et al. showe
that autoimmune CSU (defined by the presence of IgG anti-IgE or anti-FceRI, a positive LAT

and a positive ASST) have significantly higher IgG against TPO than patient. with nonautoimmune CSU.(15) In our cohort, we found a correlation between resiive ASST and
presence of concomitant autoimmune disease and/or AAbs. This assoc:ation was not always
found in previous studies, a discrepancy which could be explaircc b, che fact that we got
interest for both; presence of concomitant autoimmune disease and AAbs.(16-19) The
proportion of positive ASST in our cohort of patients vwiu. CSU (40%) is consistent with
previous reports (30% to 50%).(8, 20) Presence of conconutant autoimmune disease and/or
AAbs or positivity of ASST was not correlated wit 1 di. case activity nor with H1-antihistamines
response. In the literature, this association butv7een ASST and disease activity remains
controversial.(16, 20-22) In line with tie toss reports, angioedema was more frequent in
patients with positive ASST in our .o.o1+17, 18) This study put forward that personal and
familial autoimmune disease his ory as well as autoimmune serology, especially IgG against

TPO, are easy to get and coul 1 be interesting to record in patients with CSU.

As several studies ha- vostuiated that CRP and IgE serum levels or D-dimer plasma level could
be considered as ‘ion arkers of CSU or CSU activity, we have measured them and looked for

correlations w th cach others and with clinical data in this prospective study of 95 CSU patients.

CRP s>.a n level has been proposed as a biomarker of disease activity in patients with CSU,
hoy-ev 2r results are contradictory.(23, 24) Our findings show that CRP (mean CRP 7.7 mg/L) was
higher in CSU patients with more active disease and in Hi-antihistamines unresponders.
However, to our opinion, CRP is not an interesting biomarker in CSU due to its relatively low
levels compared with others inflammatory diseases and due to possible fluctuations by
intercurrent phenomena which are not always reported especially in retrospective studies. CRP
is more useful in the differential diagnoses of CSU, a high CRP level, not reducing under

treatment, could be a sign of an auto-inflammatory syndrome.

10
Several studies have shown (i) higher D-dimer plasma levels in patients with CSU compared
with HCs, (ii) higher D-dimer plasma levels in more active disease, as well as (iii) normalization
of D-dimer plasma levels during remission.(25, 26) In our cohort, D-dimer plasma levels were
higher in Hj-antihistamines unresponders and to a lesser extent, in more active disease.
Interestingly, we also found that patients with autoimmune status had higher D-dimer plasma
levels than those without autoimmunity. Furthermore, in line with previous reports, we found
a significant decrease of D-dimer plasma levels under omalizumab treatment. Baseline D-“iu>e1
plasma levels do not predict the response to omalizumab,(27-29) whereas the decre:se 0. Ddimer plasma levels under omalizumab treatment seem to be a marker of gooa re.nonse to
treatment.(30) Measurement of D-dimer plasma levels could be added to clinical tc ols, such as
UAS7, to evaluate activity/severity. Concerning response to treatment, »s vell as relation

between D-dimer plasma levels and autoimmunity, further studies 79 1.ce Jed.

Mean total IgE serum levels have often been studied in pa.‘ents with CSU and have been
proposed as a biomarker of disease activity, however, .«si !ts emain contradictory.(31, 32) In
our study, the mean total IgE serum levels of untre *ted patients was in normal range or little
high (208.2+451.8 kU/L, except in atopic patic>t. for which is high), and less than half of
patients had total IgE serum levels higher tin. ..c.mal reference value. Total IgE serum levels
didn’t correlate with disease activity nor vitt response to Hj-antihistamines. Interestingly total
IgE serum levels were lower in rt. nt: with positive ASST (mean 103.37+/-120.25 kU/L)
compared with negative ASST (mer 207.32+/-225.51 kU/L) (p=0.016). This finding is in line
with recent publications si10 ‘1g that very low total IgE and positive ASST have been related
with poor/no respo.;e anu with slow response to omalizumab respectively.(27, 33-36)
Moreover, Sckoe; ke « al. put forward that autoimmune CSU have significantly lower total IgE
serum levels .'an 201. autoimmune CSU.(15) Low baseline IgE has been described as a marker
of poor re~por.se.(27, 34, 37) However this has not been confirmed by all studies.(38, 39)
Inter >sung.y, a recent paper suggest that total IgE levels can be used as predictors of response
«© o.>4lizumab only in nonatopic CSU patients, actually they showed that the atopic status

1odify the ability of IgE to predict the response to the treatment.(40)

Several authors have discussed a possible main role of basophils. Indeed, in our study, we found
that blood basophil counts were significantly lower in patients with CSU compared with
healthy controls. Moreover, blood basophil counts correlated with disease activity. Basophils

are probably recruited into the skin during wheal formation, as evidenced by an abundance of

i,
basophils in skin samples(41, 42) and low blood basophil counts in patients with chronic
urticaria.(43, 44) Furthermore, in our study, blood basophil counts were significantly lower in
patients with positive ASST and also tended to be correlated with presence of concomitant
autoimmune disease and/or AAbs. This correlation has previously been poorly investigated and
with controversial results.(21, 43, 45, 46) Nevertheless, expression of activation markers, such
as CD203c and CD63, has been found to be higher in blood basophils of CSU patients with
positive ASST compared to patients with negative ASST.(45, 47) It is tempting to speru:>te
that in patients with positive ASST, basophils are implicated and activated in a more ? npor.ant
way, and thus reduced in blood due to recruitment into the skin. Mechanisms 1.1p‘cated in
basophils activation/recruitment in skin are actually unknown, however accoi.‘ing to previous

findings, AAbs could be indirectly implicated.

Additionally, under omalizumab treatment, we observed a significa.*t in srease in blood basophil
counts, suggesting that omalizumab blocks this basophil shi: from te bloodstream into the
skin. Unfortunately, our cohort of patients was too ~moll 15 identify differences between
responders/unresponders and fast/slow responders »» omaizumab. In the same line, previous
authors have already observed increased blood b276,-hi, counts in correlation with improvement
on treatment or remission.(48, 49) Howeve. da.2 -oncerning blood basophil counts in patients

with CSU under omalizumab treatment «~e s::arce.(50-53)

Consistence of this study is to hav2 analyzed several biomarkers, evaluated in untreated
patients, as well as a series of c'ini val parameters in a prospective cohort. Limitations are mainly
due to the fact that corr:laions between clinical/biological parameters and omalizumab
response (or delay “ response) were not possible due to the small number of patients in each
group. Second:,. -uncerning autoimmune CSU investigations, we haven’t performed

functional test: .s BAT and BHRA nor IgG anti-FceRI/IgE measurement.

Te co..clude, in this prospective study, we found a relatively high incidence of concomitant
au.ximmune disease and AAbs. D-dimer plasma level is higher in Hi-antihistamines
unresponders and in patients with autoimmune status. Total IgE serum levels were lower in
patients with positive ASST compared with negative ASST. We found lower blood basophil
counts in patients with CSU compared with healthy controls. Moreover, this finding was more

significant in patients with positive ASST and to a lesser extent in patients with autoimmune

12
status. Moreover, under omalizumab, blood basophil counts and total IgE serum levels

increased and conversely D-dimer plasma levels decrease.

Our study brings additional evidences over the utility of those clinical and biological parameters
to investigate in patients with CSU as they could be related to disease activity, response to

treatment or autoimmunity.
