To the Editor:

Omalizumab has demonstrated excellent efficacy for the treatment of chronic
spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in several randomized clinical trials and real-world
studies.'? As a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, omalizumab prevents IgE binding to the
high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) on the surface of basophils and mast cells, resulting
in a significant reduction in FcsRI levels on these cells and, therefore, in their capacity
to respond to allergen exposure.’ In this regard, the potential for predicting clinical
outcomes during anti-I[gE therapy based on basophil allergen response have been
investigated in several studies mainly focused on allergic respiratory diseases.* In CSU,
meanwhile, it has been recently demonstrated that the modulation of the basophil FceRI
expression plays a key role in the clinical improvement observed during omalizumab
therapy.*° Thus, a significant drop in the basophil FceRI expression is immediately
observed after the first dose that is maintained throughout the duration of the treatment.°
Although this phenomenon seems to occur very soon after starting treatment, timing to
satisfactory clinical response to omalizumab can be highly variable. The purpose of this
study was to evaluate the evolution of the basophil FceRI expression in patients with
CSU showing a fast and slow clinical response to anti-IgE therapy, with the goal of a
better characterization of such individuals and to examine potential associations for

these response patterns.

This prospective study included patients with active CSU whose symptoms were not
controlled with H1-antihistamines (even up to 4 times the recommended dose). These
subjects were treated with omalizumab 300mg every 4 weeks, and peripheral blood
samples were obtained prior to the Ist (baseline), 2nd, 3rd and 6th injection. Basophil
FceeRI expression was measured by flow cytometry from these samples following
standard procedures (Online Repository), and the levels were expressed as mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI). Response to treatment was defined as an improvement of
the patients’ signs and symptoms achieving a weekly Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7)
<6."° The cut-off time chosen for distinguishing fast responders (FR) and slow
responders (SR) was 4 weeks, which corresponds to the usual first visit after starting
treatment. To avoid potential interferences, patients who received anti-IgE therapy
before, or were diagnosed of a chronic pruritic disease other than CSU (e.g. atopic
dermatitis) were excluded from the study. It should be also noted that, since FceRI

expression in non-responders to omalizumab has been extensively studied in a recent
paper, these subjects were excluded from the present analysis. The local clinical

research ethics committee granted ethical approval for the study (2012/4913/D.

A total of 44 patients (31 women) responded to treatment with omalizumab. Thirtythree (75%) out of 44 patients responded within 4 weeks and were classified as FR,
whereas the remaining 11 (25%) required more administrations to respond (SR; median
time to response: 20 weeks; range, 8-36). No significant differences regarding clinical
and demographic features were found between both groups (Table I). For clinical
reasons, the autologous serum skin test (ASST) was performed only in 37 patients,
being positive in 50% (14/28) and 77.8% (7/9) of the FR and SR, respectively (p=0.248;
Fisher exact test). Regarding the basophil FceRI expression, the median value at
baseline was significantly higher in the FR (median 13247 of MFI; range 6753-25281)
than in the SR (median 8428 of MFI; range 5720-17375) (p=0.002; Mann-Whitney U
test; Fig.1A). However, no significant differences were observed regarding the
evolution of the FceRI expression during anti-IgE therapy between FR and SR, showing
both a sharp reduction at 4 weeks that was maintained throughout the duration of the
treatment (p>0.05 at 4,8 and 20 weeks; Test for the equality of medians; Fig.1B).
Finally, a positive correlation was found between levels of total serum IgE and baseline

FceRI expression (Pearson’s correlation coefficient 7=0.355; p=0.018; Fig.1C).

Few data are available regarding the patterns of response to omalizumab in CSU. Data
from phase III clinical trials suggest that there might be two categories of responders:
those who respond after just one dose of omalizumab (within four weeks), and those
who required two or more doses to achieve the disease control.° However, the exact
mechanisms responsible for these responses remain unknown and, more importantly,
immunological markers predicting this phenomenon are currently scarce. In this sense,
Gericke et al postulated that serum autoreactivity may be associated with the time to
symptom relief with anti-IgE therapy.’ Thus, the authors found that a slow response
could probably be predicted by a positive basophil histamine release assay (BHRA) and
ASST. In other words, a slow response to omalizumab might occur mainly in patients
with autoantibodies directed against either the cell-bound IgE or FceRI. Although no
significant differences were found between ASST and time to response in our
population, a positive ASST result was more frequently observed in SR. Moreover,

according with our analysis, baseline FceRI expression may also be associated with the
time to response to omalizumab. Thus, patients with very high baseline levels might be
more likely to achieve an early therapeutic response. A possible explanation is that
these autoantibodies against FceRI, which are presumably present in SR, could interfere
in the measurement of basophil FceRI expression by flow cytometry, causing lower
levels than in FR. Apart from this difference, the FceRI expression seems to exhibit a
similar evolution during anti-IgE therapy in both categories of responders, showing a
sharp drop immediately after the initial dose that is maintained during the subsequent
administrations. This finding suggest that the FceRI down-regulation may not be a
definitive mechanism of action in some patients and therefore, the combination of more
than one pharmacological mechanism seems necessary to fully explain the pattern of

symptoms improvement seen with omalizumab therapy in CSU.

Regarding total IgE levels, previous studies have demonstrated a positive correlation
between basophil FceRI expression and total serum IgE levels in a variety of disease
states, such as asthma, atopic dermatitis and hyper-IgE syndrome.* Similarly, this
association could also be observed in patients with CSU. However, in this condition,
which is not considered a classic allergic disease, the correlation seems to be weaker,
suggesting that other factors may also have a significant influence on FceRI expression.
In addition, it has been recently postulated that total IgE levels could have an important
role in predicting the clinical response to omalizumab in CSU.’ In our study, although
not significant on the 5% level, a trend towards lower IgE levels in SR was also noted.
The value of total IgE as a useful biomarker of time to omalizumab response in CSU
may be somewhat controversial, given the wide range and overlapping of values

(therefore, not a clear distinction) observed in both categories of responders.

In summary, although further investigations are needed to confirm these preliminary
observations, our study suggests the existence of a link between baseline levels of
basophil FceRI expression and time to response to omalizumab in CSU, with higher
levels shown in FR. The knowledge of the patterns of therapeutic response would have
an important impact in clinical practice, helping physicians to improve their approach

on the patients' follow-up.

Methods

Basophil cell preparation and flow cytometry

 

Flow cytometry analysis was performed following standard procedures. Briefly, 150 pl
anticoagulated blood was incubated on the same day of collection during 20 min at 4°C
with an excess of human immunoglobulins to block unspecific binding. Afterwards,
blood was stained with either anti-CD123-PE (BD) or anti-CD193-APC (Miltenyi) to
identify basophils and with anti-FceRla-FITC (clone CRA1, Ebiosciences) or an
isotype control to establish the expression of FceRI on the surface of blood basophils.
The samples were then lysed and fixed using the FACS Lysing Solution (BD
Biosciences) and analyzed by flow cytometry in a FACSCanto using the FACSDiva
software. At least 2 x 10° events were acquired. Instrument settings (e.g. scatter and
voltage settings and compensation matrix) and experimental conditions (e.g. antibody
clones and dilution) remained strictly constant for all samples throughout the study. To
ensure consistency in the analysis, the same investigator processed and analyzed all
samples and two independent researchers correlated the levels of basophil FceRI

expression and the clinical scores.

Autologous serum skin test

 

The autologous serum skin test (ASST) was performed as previously described.”
Briefly, venous blood was taken before the first administration of omalizumab. Samples
were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes and the serum separated. Afterwards, 50
mL of fresh undiluted autologous serum was injected intradermally into the patient’s
volar forearm. Similar volumes of 0.9% NaCl saline and 100 mg/mL histamine were
used as negative and positive controls, respectively. A positive ASST was considered
when the diameter of serum-induced wheal was >1.5mm compared to the saline
induced response at 30 minutes.
