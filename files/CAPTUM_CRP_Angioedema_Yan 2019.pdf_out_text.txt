Abstract

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a frequent disorder with recurrent itchy
wheals and/or angioedema, and nearly 35% patients respond poorly to non-sedating
H1 antihistamine treatment. CRP gene encodes the C-reactive protein, which is involved in the pathogenesis of CSU. To investigate the impacts of CRP polymorphisms
on the susceptibility and therapeutic efficacy in the South Han CSU patients, we
enrolled 145 CSU patients in our study. After 4-week non-sedating H1 antihistamine
monotherapy treatment, more than 50% reduction of the severity score is considered as effective, or else non-effective. The CRP rs3093059T/C and rs2794521G/A
genotypes of patients were determined by Sequenom MassARRAY. Functional studies including relative luciferase assay and $-hexosaminidase assay were conducted in
HEK293T cells or RBL-2H3 cells to explore the function of variants. Forty (62.50%)
CSU patients were effective when treated with mizolastine, and 55 (72.4%) patients
were effective in the desloratadine group. We found that the patients carried with
rs3093059TT genotype were significantly associated with good response (OR = 4.20,
P = 0.015), had lower serum CRP, IL-6 and TNF-a levels than the CT/CC genotypes. In
vitro, the rs3093059C allele exhibited significantly higher luciferase activity than
wild allele (P < 0.001). From the B-hexosaminidase assay, we observed the inhibiting
degranulation effects by mizolastine and this effect is weakened when with a higher
dose CRP in RBL-2H3 cells. Our findings suggested that CSU patients carrying the

rs3093059C allele may respond poorly to mizolastine with elevated serum CRP level.

common type of chronic urticaria among the young people in China
according to a multicentre hospital-based study, Due to the longterm recurrence, extensive lesions and pruritus, as well as unstable
drug efficiency, the impact on the quality of CSU patients’ daily life
is equal to ischaemic heart disease,!7 10] and the annual economic
costs reached almost 10 000 Chinese yuan for each CSU patient.!11!
Additionally, nearly 35% patients respond in vain on CSU therapy
and efficacy varies between different patients."?! Therefore, we
should take measures to optimize and achieve better clinical outcomes for CSU patients.

Previous studies pointed out that mast cells and basophils play significant roles in the pathogenesis of CSU."34! For instance, it has been
reported that the coagulation system and complement system participate in the mast cell activation in CSU patients, 15141 C-reactive protein
(CRP), encoded by the CRP gene, is greatly increased during infection,
acute injury and autoimmune-related diseases."7! CRP is regarded as
an acute phase protein (APP) in the course of mast cell degranulation
and complement system activation in the coagulation system, "8-24
CRP is correlated with the disease severity of csu,221 Recently, studies showed that CRP polymorphisms affected the serum CRP level,
and there was a positive association between CRP polymorphisms and
disease disorders, such as HBV-related liver cancer and stroke.2324)
Interestingly, in our previous study, serum CRP protein level in CSU patients is significantly correlated with the severity of csu.?5! However,
the association between CRP gene polymorphisms and the risk of CSU
has not been studied. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether CRP polymorphisms have impacts on susceptibility to CSU.

The second-generation non-sedating H1 antihistamines are the
first choice for the treatment of CSU.2¢27! Non-sedating H1 antihistamine drugs mizolastine, desloratadine and fexofenadine are
widely used as H1-receptor antagonist. They can stabilize mast cell
membranes and have anti-inflammatory effects, such as inhibiting
the secretion of Th2 cytokines and the production of leukotriene.22!
It is reported that gene variants also have an impact on treatment

[29,30]

outcomes. According to our previous studies, both C5AR

rs11673309 and ORAI1 rs3741595 were associated with the efficacy

[31,32] Among

of the non-sedating H1 antihistamine desloratadine.!
patients treated with levocetirizine, researchers observed that the
elevated CRP level was associated with poor response and CRP polymorphisms affected the serum CRP level.'23:34] Based on these facts,
we hope to investigate whether CRP polymorphisms may influence
the therapeutic efficacy of non-sedating H1 antihistamines through

affecting the level of CRP.

2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 | Patient enrolment

All patients enrolled in our study were outpatients of Xiangya
Hospital from 2012 to 2013, diagnosed independently by two dermatologists according to the 2009 EAACI/GA(2)LEN guidelines. All
the patients were treated with non-sedating H1 antihistamine mon
otherapy. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for enrolment were

241

the same as in our previous studies.’
by the Ethics Committee of Xiangya Hospital and was registered on
the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry online (the registration number is
ChiCTR-OCH-14004518). Written informed consent was obtained
from each patient.

All patients were treated with non-sedating H1 antihistamine
monotherapy for 4 weeks (mizolastine 10 mg/d, desloratadine 5 mg/d
and fexofenadine 120 mg/d). The Dermatology Life Quality Index
(DLQI) was used to assess the quality of life in CSU patients. The efficacy of the antihistamines was evaluated using the weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7) by two professional dermatologists independently,
both at baseline and after antihistamine monotherapy for 4 weeks.
Responders were defined as those patients who had an improvement

in UAS7 scores above 50% after the 4-week treatment.8152:351

2.2 | SNP genotyping

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs3093059 (-757C/T) and
182794521 (-717G/A) locate in the promoter region of CRP gene and
have already been discovered in the Asian population (http://asia.
ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Transcript/Exons?db=core;g=ENSGO
0000132693;r=1:159712289-159714589;t=ENST00000255030).
Three web-based analysis software programs were used to predict the functional damage of the SNPs rs3093059(-757C/T)
and = rs2794521(-717G/A).(http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgVai;
http://asia.ensembl.org/Tools/VEP;http://alggen.|si.upc.es/cgibin/
promo_v3/promo/promoinit.cgi?dirDB=TF_8.3). Both of the SNPs
rs3093059 and rs2794521 were located in the promoter region of
the CRP gene which may be the transcription factor binding site for
C/EBPa, Cutl1 and POU1F1a.

Five millilitres of venous blood was obtained by venipuncture
from chronic spontaneous urticaria patients. Genome DNA was extracted from the whole blood sample using a genome DNA isolation
kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and then stored at -80°C for further
analysis. All the samples were genotyped by the method of allelespecific matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometry (Sequenom, Inc., San Diego, CA). Only when a
95% positive rate of a genotype matching a SNP was certified.

2.3 | Detection of serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-a
by ELISA

We detected the serum levels of cytokines, including IL-6 and
TNF-a levels, in different rs3093059T/C and rs2794521G/A genotype carriers, according to the instructions of the ELISA kits (BD

Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

2.4 | Cell culture

HEK 293T and RBL-2H3 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in
DMEM (Biological Industries, Israel) with 10% foetal bovine serum,
100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin at 37°C with 5%
CO, in a humidified atmosphere.

2.5 | Cloning of expression plasmids, luciferase
reporter assay

The pGL3 vectors expressing CRP rs3093059T and rs3093059C alleles were constructed by PCR amplification using human genomic
DNA as a template. The product size was 1128 bp, and the primers
are shown in Table S1.

Each of the PCR products of the rs3093059 wild-type T allele and
mutant type C allele vector was sub-cloned separately into the KpnlXhol site of the pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega,
Madison, WI). The expression plasmids were transfected into HEK
293T using TurboFect reagent (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL).
Then, the constructs (0.4 jg) were transfected into each well with
pRL-TK (0.1 pg/well) plasmid for normalization of transfection efficiency differences in HEK 293T cells. After 24 hours of incubation,
the cells were lysed by 1x PLB lysation and then stored at -80°C
before use. The relative reporter gene level was analysed in a dualluciferase reporter assay according to the manufacturer's proce
dures (Promega Corporation) and using a microplate system.

2.6 | B-Hexosaminidase and cytokine release assay

We indirectly evaluated the mast cell degranulation level via Bhexosaminidase release assay as previously described." RBL-2H3
cells were preplanted into 24-well plates, and recombinant CRP at
different concentrations (0, 1 or 10 jig/mL) with or without mizolastine (10°° mol/L) (Xi'an Janssen Pharmaceutical, Ltd, Xi'an, China) was
added for 6 hours. After washing three times with HBSS, phorbol12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) (100 nmol/L, Sigma, St. Louis, MO)
and ionomycin (1 pmol/L, Sigma) were used to stimulate cell degranulation for 4 hours. Subsequently, cells and supernatant were collected to evaluate the p-hexosaminidase release ratio by microplate
spectrophotometer at 405 nm, and the data were analysed by comparing the supernatant release rate to the total B-hexosaminidase.'3]
Meanwhile, cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-a in the supernatant
were detected via ELISA according to the manufacturer’s instruc
tions (BD Biosciences).

2.7 | Statistical analysis

The data were all analysed using SPSS version 22.0 (IBM SPSS,
Chicago, IL), and the frequencies of alleles and genotypes and
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were determined by chi-square test.
The clinical data of two groups were analysed by independent t test,
and the difference in CRP concentration between different genotypes was analysed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Bonferroni correction was used to correct the significance after multiple-testing,
and the corrected P values less than 0.025 (0.05/2) were considered
significant in this study.

The power of the sample size was calculated by G power (3.1.9.2
version). In the responder and non-responder group treated with
mizolastine, the power was analysed with the effect size being
0.7697, the « error being 0.05, the total sample size being 64; then,

the estimated power was 0.9998. Clinical characteristics, such as
CRP and the baseline UAS7, were also analysed. The effect size
ranged was 1.7356 in ANOVA test, the a error was 0.05, the total
sample size was 145, and the power was 1.000.

3 | RESULTS

3.1 | Clinical characteristics of CSU patients

We detected the clinical features and CRP rs3093059 and rs2794521
genotypes of 145 enrolled CSU patients (55 males and 90 females with
ages ranging from 18 to 66 years). The frequencies of CRP rs3093059
and rs2794521 genotypes in 145 CSU patients were in Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium (P = 0.400 and 0.709, respectively), and the rate in groups
treated with mizolastine and desloratadine was also in Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium (P = 0.252 and 0.977, respectively). There were no significant differences in age, duration of disease, or baseline DLQI score
among rs3093059TT, rs3093059CT and rs3093059CC genotypes
(P > 0.05) (Table S2). However, the serum CRP level was significantly
higher in rs3093059CT heterozygotes and rs3093059CC homozygotes when compared with rs3093059TT homozygotes (4.9 + 6.9 mg/
dL vs 11.1412.5mg/dL vs 2.5+3.4mg/dL, P= 0.001). We found
significantly different levels of baseline UAS7, gender ratio among different rs3093059T/C genotypes (P = 0.011, 0.016, respectively). The
same trend could be seen among rs2794521GG, rs2794521GA and
1s2794521AA genotypes (Table $2). The detailed demographic information is shown in supplementary. No significant difference of the
rs3093059 and rs2794521 alleles’ frequencies was found between
the enrolled CSU patients and the data of South Han Chinese from the
1000 Genomes Project regarding different (Table $3).

3.2 | Antihistamine and anti-inflammatory effects
of non-sedating H1 antihistamine monotherapy on
CSU patients with different genotypes

Among all the 145 patients, 98 (67.59%) of the enrolled CSU patients responded well, while the other 47 (32.41%) patients were
non-responders. Among all the treated patients, 76 of 145 patients
were treated with desloratadine (55 patients were effective and
21 patients were no response), 64 were treated with mizolastine
(40 were effective and 24 with no response), and five were treated
with fexofenadine (three were effective and two with no response).
There was no significant difference between the responder group
and non-responder group regarding age, gender, duration of disease, CRP and baseline UAS7 and DLQI scores, even in the mizolastine and desloratadine-therapy group (Table $4). However, we found
the whole non-sedating H1 antihistamine efficacy was different between rs3093059TT homozygotes and rs3093059CT/CC genotypes
(Table 1, OR = 2.58, P = 0.011). We also observed a higher serum CRP
level in rs3093059CT heterozygotes and rs3093059CC homozygotes
than rs3093059TT genotype (P = 0.001). Serum IL-6 and TNF-a levels
were significantly higher in rs3093059CC and CT carriers compared
with those in rs3093059TT carriers (Figure 1A,B).

Meanwhile, we observed a different efficacy between
rs3093059TT homozygotes and rs3093059CC/CT genotypes in
mizolastine-treated group (Table 1). The rs3093059CT heterozygotes and rs3093059CC homozygotes manifested a weaker response than rs3093059TT homozygotes after mizolastine therapy
(OR = 4.20, P = 0.015), but this was not seen in patients treated
with desloratadine monotherapy (Table 1). Additionally, patients
carrying the C allele showed a poor response than those carrying
the T allele (P = 0.012). The data of CSU patients treated with fexofenadine could not be analysed due to the small sample size. For
1s2794521G/A, SNP showed no influence on the non-sedating H1
antihistamines efficacy (P = 0.040, Table 1); thus, we did not explore
its further mechanisms.

3.3 | Relative luciferase activity of different
rs3093059 alleles

To investigate the mechanism of rs3093059T/C on the impact of

non-sedating antihistamines efficacy, the luciferase reporter assay

243
Experimental Dermatology BAYVAl Ley

was tested in in vitro experiments. We constructed luciferase reporter plasmids expressing rs3093059C, rs3093059T and transfected them into HEK293T cells. Constructs that expressing the
rs3093059C allele exhibited significantly higher luciferase activity
compared with rs3093059T allele (P < 0.001, Figure 2A). This result
suggests that the CRP gene with the rs3093059C allele is more active than the rs3093059T, respectively.

3.4 | B-Hexosaminidase release assay after
stimulation with recombinant CRP

After incubation with mizolastine and recombinant CRP at different concentrations, PMA and ionomycin-induced B-hexosaminidase
release was measured. We found that the degranulation level in
RBL-2H3 cells decreased with the mizolastine incubation (P < 0.001,
Figure 2B) and this inhibition was attenuated by recombinant CRP at

a higher dose on B-hexosaminidase release (Figure 2B).

3.5 | Cytokine secretion from mizolastine-treated
RBL-2H3 cells stimulated by recombinant CRP at
different concentrations

In RBL-2H3 cells, the degranulation level is elevated after the incubation of CRP alone and declined when added mizolastine. The
degranulation of mast cell is accompanied with the release of cytokines and chemokines. Just like the degranulation inhibition, we
found that the cytokines IL-6 and TNF-« secreted in the supernatant
were also inhibited by mizolastine, and this inhibition was weakened
by a higher concentration of recombinant CRP in RBL-2H3 cells.
(Figure 2C,D).

4 | DISCUSSION

Our results suggest that CRP SNP rs3093059T may predict a good
efficacy of non-sedating H1 antihistamines among CSU patients,
especially mizolastine. Rs3093059T allele carriers took weaker promoter activity and lower TNF-a and IL-6 level. The inhibition ability

of the mast cell degranulation by mizolastine is weakened with a
higher CRP level.

Studies indicated that not all CSU patients respond well to the
H1 antihistamines, even at high doses.!7! Nearly 20% patients prescribing with up-dosing fexofenadine still responded poorly,42) The
mechanisms underlying the inter-individual differences are still unclear. It is suggested that gene polymorphisms may have an impact
on individual responsiveness to drugs. In a Korean study, the CRTH2
gene mutant influenced the cAMP level and resulted in an elevation in calcium influx thus affecting the desloratadine doses in CSU
patients.2% CRP is secreted by liver cells, and CRP can influences
mast cell degranulation. Previous studies showed that CRP might
predict non-sedating H1 antihistamine responsiveness, in which
non-responders have a higher serum CRP level.'8738) A Tunisian CSU
study showed there was a CRP high concentration remission after

'89] Meanwhile, articles on the study of CRP

gene polymorphisms indicate that CRP genetic variants (such as
rs1800947, rs1205 and rs3093059) are associated with disease, including stroke, Takayasu arteritis and HBV-related liver cancer 40-42]
Thus, we investigate whether CRP gene polymorphisms influence
drug therapy and disease risk. Our in vitro data and results suggest
that the CRP gene polymorphism rs3093059T/C may be associated
with the therapeutic efficacy of non-sedating H1 antihistamines in
CSU patients. As we know, this is the first study to illustrate the influence of CRP genetic polymorphisms on the development of CSU
and even the non-sedating H1 antihistamine efficacy.

Among the CSU patients, we observed that patients carrying the
1s3093059C allele had weaker responses to mizolastine than those
harbouring the rs3093059T allele. Rs3093059C allele carriers had
higher serum CRP, IL-6 and TNF-a levels compared with rs3093059T
carries. TNF-a could mediate pro-inflammatory cytokines, and IL-6

was representative Th2 cytokine.49! According to previous studies,
IL-6 can induce the release of CRP and then aggravate cytokine release and augment humoral immune responses, which may suggest
that the rs3093059T allele may improve the therapeutic efficacy
of mizolastine by decreasing CRP levels.!"?! We suggest that CRP
rs3093059T/C as well as serum CRP level would be taken as predictive markers of mizolastine efficacy.

As non-sedating antihistamines including mizolastine could inhibit histamine release and cytokine secretion.2®! To further investigate the mechanism that why patients carrying rs3093059C allele
lack more response to standard dose mizolastine, we conducted the
in vitro study with B-HEX release assay which indirectly represent
the level of mast cell degranulation. We found that the B-HEX release
ratio showed a decrease when adding mizolastine. Furthermore, CRP
dose-dependently attenuated the inhibiting effects of mizolastine on
mast cell activation through increasing the release of B-HEX. Taken
together, our findings suggested that patients carrying rs3093059C
allele responded poorly to mizolastine may because of the weakened
inhibition of mast cell activation with higher CRP concentration.

Additionally, our previous studies have determined the genetic
polymorphisms that are associated with the risks of CSU susceptibility. For instance, FCER1A rs2298805G, ORAI1 rs3741596A and
rs12313209T increased the risks to CSU susceptibility.81°! CRP
acted as an acute phase protein in inflammation.444°! In CSU, CRP
may play a role in the complement system and coagulation, thus affecting tissue factor release and mediating mast cell activation. "17!
However, we did not observe a correlation between rs3093059T/C
and CSU susceptibility in our study, although the serum CRP level
was different among different rs3093059 T/C genotypes. The association between rs2794521G/A and CSU susceptibility was also not
significant. Since there is no report on the relationship between CRP
gene polymorphisms and CSU susceptibility at home and abroad, we
are temporarily unable to determine whether CRP polymorphisms
are really associated with the onset of CSU. We need to expand the
sample study to add more evidence to prove the relationship between CRP gene polymorphisms and CSU susceptibility.

Our present study was first to investigate the association of CRP
SNPs rs3093059, rs2794521 in CSU susceptibility and even nonsedating H1 antihistamine responses. Although we did not find any
association between the CRP rs3093059T/C polymorphism and
the risk of CSU, we found a relationship between this SNP and nonsedating H1 antihistamine mizolastine efficacy. However, due to the
limitations of our sample size and single-centre study, our findings need
to be further confirmed. Therefore, further multicentre and large sample size studies should be undertaken to confirm this hypothesis, and
functional studies should be undertaken to explore the mechanism of
non-sedating H1 antihistamines in inter-individual differences in CSU.

In conclusion, CRP rs3093059T/C may be associated with the
response to non-sedating H1 antihistamine mizolastine monotherapy. Patients carrying the rs3093059C allele may respond poorly to
mizolastine with elevated serum CRP, TNF-« and IL-6 levels. These
results may guide dermatologists in choosing individualized CSU pa
tient therapy.
