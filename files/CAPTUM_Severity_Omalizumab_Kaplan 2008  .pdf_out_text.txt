Background: Approximately 45% of patients with chronic
urticaria have an IgG autoantibody directed to the a-subunit of
the high-affinity IgE receptor (chronic autoimmune urticaria,
CAU) leading to cutaneous mast cell and basophil activation.
Treatment of allergic asthma with omalizumab produces rapid
reduction in free IgE levels and subsequent decrease in FceRI
expression on mast cells and basophils. If this occurs in CAU,
cross-linking of IgE receptors by autoantibody would be less
likely, reducing cell activation and urticaria/angioedema.
Objective: To investigate the efficacy of omalizumab in patients
with CAU symptomatic despite antihistamine therapy.
Methods: Twelve patients with CAU, identified by basophil
histamine release assay and autologous skin test, with persistent
symptoms for at least 6 weeks despite antihistamines, were
treated with placebo for 4 weeks followed by omalizumab
(=0.016mg¢/kg/IU mL"! IgE per month) every 2 or 4 weeks for
16 weeks. Primary efficacy variable was change from baseline to
the final 4 weeks of omalizumab treatment in mean Urticaria
Activity Score (UAS, 0-9 scale). Changes in rescue medication
use and quality of life were assessed.

Results: Mean UAS declined significantly from baseline to
the final 4 weeks of omalizumab treatment (7.50 + 1.78 to
2.66 + 3.31, -4.84 + 2.86, P = .0002). Seven patients achieved
complete symptom resolution. In 4 patients, mean UAS
decreased, but urticaria persisted. One patient did not
respond. Rescue medication use was reduced significantly, and
quality of life improved. No adverse effects were reported or
observed.

Conclusion: This exploratory proof of concept study suggests
omalizumab is an effective therapy for CAU resistant to
antihistamines. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2008;122:569-73.)

Chronic urticaria is thought to have an autoimmune basis in
approximately 45% of patients. The most common association is
the presence of IgG antibody directed to the a-subunit of the IgE
receptor. This autoantibody cross-links the a-subunits, leading to
degranulation of basophils’? and cutaneous mast cells.* Histamine
can be readily detected in basophil release assays, which use patient
serum, or purified IgG, or IgG subclasses" isolated by affinity chromatography. Histamine release is augmented by complement activation? with release of C5a.° There is also evidence for basophil
secretion of leukotrienes and cytokines. The chemotactic activity
of C5a for neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes® is consistent
with the prominence of these cells in skin biopsies of chronic urticaria”® compared with the infiltrate seen in allergic late-phase
reactions. Associated autoimmune phenomena include a 25% incidence of antithyroid antibodies, which can result in Hashimoto
thyroiditis,”'! as well as positive antinuclear antibodies (A. P.
Kaplan, unpublished data, September 2008). More rarely, patients
may present with Graves disease, type I diabetes mellitus, and vitiligo. The mainstays of initial therapy include antihistamines with
the possible addition of H2-blockers and leukotriene pathway inhibitors. Systemic corticosteroids or cyclosporine are frequently
used in the treatment of refractory disease!?; however, vigilance regarding potential side effects is required when these agents are used.

Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized mAb that selectively
binds to IgE. Omalizumab inhibits the binding of IgE to the highaffinity IgE receptor (FceRI) on the surface of mast cells and
basophils and reduces the number of FceRI receptors on basophils
in atopic patients. '*'* We postulated that in patients with chronic
autoimmune urticaria (CAU), omalizumab would effect a sufficient reduction in FceRI expression to prevent IgG antibody-mediated cross-linking of adjacent a-subunits and thereby prevent
cellular activation. Our experience with 12 such patients is described herein.

 

METHODS

Ata screening visit, patients age 18 to 75 years had a complete history and
physical examination, laboratory evaluations, electrocardiogram, and clinical
assessment of urticaria and angioedema. Patients with chronic urticaria were
defined as having symptoms for at least 6 weeks, with hives present most days
of the week despite antihistamines. A total serum IgE <700 IU/mL was
required to enter the study. Postulating that even small amounts of IgE might
affect FceRI density, there was no minimal level of IgE required for entry.
Patients provided serum for an assay of basophil histamine release** and underwent an autologous skin test.'"'> A positive test for either was sufficient to

be included in the study. A 1-week screening period was used to establish patient eligibility further. All patients maintained a daily diary to record urticaria
signs and symptoms based on a scoring system (0-3) as shown in Table I. Pruritus severity had to be at least moderate (score of 2 on a 0-3 scale), and the
Urticaria Activity Score (UAS), a combination of pruritus severity, number
of hives, and size of largest hive, had to be at least moderate (minimum score
of 4 on a 0-9 scale). The presence or absence of angioedema and its location
and duration were noted. Exclusion criteria were physical urticaria, urticarial
vasculitis, or urticaria secondary to any underlying disease or allergic reactions to foods or drugs. Patients who had taken oral or parenteral corticosteroids, methotrexate, cyclosporine, or other immunosuppressant medications
during the 4 weeks before screening were also excluded.

After inclusion criteria were met, all medications for the treatment of
urticaria were discontinued. All patients received placebo for 4 weeks and then
omalizumab for 16 weeks. Patients were blind to treatment sequence.
Omalizumab was administered consistent with the US product label every 2
weeks or every 4 weeks, dosed according to the patient’s body weight, and
serum IgE obtained at the screening visit. Patients with IgE <30 IU/mL
received 150 mg omalizumab every 4 weeks. Daily diaries for urticaria signs
and symptoms were maintained throughout the study. At monthly visits, the
mean UAS was calculated, rescue medication use was tabulated, and the
Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire was administered.'°
Also at each monthly visit, an overall therapeutic response was determined
by the investigator on a 5-item scale (1-5) with | representing complete relief;
5 represented no change or worsening in signs and symptoms; 2,3, and 4 represented marked, moderate, or slight relief, respectively. At the final study
erum was obtained for a posttreatment assay of basophil histamine release, and an autologous serum skin test was again administered. Patients who

    

exhibited angioedema at randomization were reassessed for its presence.

informed consent was obtained in writing from the participants.

Histamine release from basophils and histamine

assay

One healthy blood donor whose cells were reactive with anti-IgE antibody
and known to be responsive to patient sera” was chosen for this study. This
donor is atopic with a serum IgE level of 25 IU/mL. Seventy-five microliters
of serum, buffer, or positive controls (antihuman IgE 1 mg/mL) was incubated
with 75 wL leukocyte suspension for 40 minutes at 37°C. After incubation, the
supernatants were separated by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes at
room temperature. Two replicate aliquots of cells were boiled to determine
total basophil histamine content. The concentration of histamine in the
supernatant and the total basophil histamine content were measured with an
enzyme immunoassay (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif), according to the
manufacturer’ ‘tructions. Histamine release was expressed as a percentage
of total histamine content. Spontaneous histamine release from the cell suspension was less than 5% of total histamine. A level of 15% or more was taken
as positive.” The final assay repeated the samples obtained at entry with the
determination at the end of the study so that they were assayed together
with the same basophil preparation.

 

Statistical analysis

The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in mean UAS
(ie, the average over the 4-week placebo treatment period) to the final 4-week
period of omalizumab treatment. Secondary efficacy variables included the

in mean UAS, but urticaria persisted (Fig 1, C). One patient was a
nonresponder (Fig 1, D). Eight of 12 patients experienced at least
a 50% reduction in mean UAS. Significant improvement from
baseline in interference with sleep, interference with daily activities, and overall therapeutic response was observed and
paralleled the reduction in mean UAS.

Treatment with omalizumab resulted in a significant decrease
in mean rescue medication use from 99.3 (+54.1) tablets at
baseline to 29.8 (+42.9) tablets during the final 4-week period of
omalizumab treatment (change in mean rescue medication use, —
69.5 + 60.5; P =.004; Fig 2, A). Six of the 7 complete responders
took no hydroxyzine after week 12 (Fig 2, B). The seventh continued to take rescue medication because of a misunderstanding regarding as-needed use. There was a marked reduction in
hydroxyzine use in the 4 patients who responded partially (Fig
2, C) and no change in the patient who did not respond (Fig 2, D).
The DLQI questionnaire revealed improvement in mean total
quality of life score (Fig 3) for all patients taken as a sum of their
scores. The | nonresponder exacerbated severely at week 8 and
was placed on oral prednisone 4 to 10 mg/d for the remainder
of the study. To reflect this treatment failure, the maximum score
of 3 was assigned to all of this patient’s subsequent responses.
The histamine release assay was initially positive in all patients
(Table III). After treatment, the assay reverted to negative in 4 of
the 7 patients who responded completely and 1| of the 4 patients
who improved. It remained positive in 3 patients who responded
completely, 2 who improved, and the 1 nonresponder. A posttreatment sample was not obtained from 1 patient (improved).

No adverse events were reported or observed.

 

DISCUSSION

Chronic urticaria is a disease that is particularly difficult to
treat, and in severe cases, the functional impairment associated
with it is similar to that seen with coronary artery disease.'7'* Although nonsedating antihistamines are recommended as first-line
agents, a substantial proportion of patients remain poorly responsive to these agents even if H2-receptor antagonists and/or leukotriene pathway inhibitors are added.'® Such patients are often
treated with corticosteroids’? or cyclosporine,”°?! and alternatives to these agents would be a welcome addition if efficacy
could be shown with an acceptable tolerability profile.

One major subpopulation of patients with chronic urticaria is
thought to have an autoimmune etiology (40% to 45%) in which
there is IgG antibody directed to the a-subunit of the high-affinity
IgE receptor (35% to 40%)'° or to IgE itself (IgG anti-IgE; 5%
to 10%).?? As a group, symptoms are more severe in this

J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL
SEPTEMBER 2008

subpopulation of patients than in patients without such autoantibodies.”* These autoantibodies can be demonstrated by basophil
histamine release assay or by autologous skin testing. Cross-linking IgE receptors or adjacent IgE molecules by these antibodies is
requisite for activation to occur,”* and complement, especially
CSa,° augments the reaction. We reasoned that omalizumab, by
decreasing circulating IgE levels, will secondarily decrease the
IgE receptor density on basophils and cutaneous mast cells, preventing activation by autoantibodies. In addition, omalizumab
has been reported to ameliorate the symptoms of chronic urticaria
in an uncontrolled study of 3 patients, 2 of whom also had IgE-mediated asthma.?°

In this study, mean UAS decreased, mean rescue medication
use declined, and overall therapeutic response and quality of life
improved. This consistency in effect across all defined outcome
measures demonstrates the internal validity of the study and
suggests omalizumab may be useful in the treatment of patients
with CAU not responsive to antihistamines.

Although no patient had asthma, the dose and dosing frequency
were based on the total serum IgE and body weight, consistent
with that used for asthma patients otherwise eligible for omalizumab therapy. Patients with IgE <30 IU/mL received the lowest
dose of omalizumab stipulated in the product label. A post hoc
analysis revealed that 5 of 6 patients with a baseline total serum
IgE <30 IU/mL responded, and 3 of 6 patients with an IgE >301U/
mL responded. This suggests that eliminating even small amounts
of IgE may modulate the disease process.

The limitations of this study were that it involved a small cohort
of patients and was not a parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial,
which may not have taken into account the potential cyclical nature
of the disease in some. Although patients were blind to treatment
sequence, investigators were aware. Among its strengths are a
careful characterization of patients entering the trial, assessment of
effect after placebo exposure to establish a baseline, and close
follow-up based on specialist care. Most importantly, outcome
measures were primarily patient-reported, enhancing the external
validity of the study.

Although patients were eligible for enrollment on the basis of
either a positive test for anti-IgE receptor antibody by histamine
release assay~° or by autologous skin test,”’ all patients were initially positive for basophil histamine release. The assay is considered to be the most reliable test to categorize patients into the
autoimmune versus idiopathic subgroups.”° The favorable result
observed, presumably secondary to downregulation of the high-affinity IgE receptor, may represent the first time an immune modulator has been observed to downregulate this autoimmune target.
Although omalizumab downregulates IgE receptors on patients’
basophils or mast cells,”* it should not affect the level of an IgG autoantibody directed against IgE receptor. Nevertheless, as demonstrated by the repeat of the basophil histamine release assay at
study end (Table III), there was a decrease in functional antibody
in 5 patients who had complete clearing of hives and in 3 patients
who experienced a reduction in symptoms. It is not possible to distinguish whether reducing antigen load might have an effect on
antibody levels or whether some of these represent spontaneous
remissions. However, as a consequence of lowering serum IgE
levels, the lowering of FceRI on basophils and mast cells for 16
weeks may have provided negative feedback to production of functional autoimmune IgG antibodies. Only further observation will
determine whether downregulation of the target antigen structure
for a period results in continued remission of CAU either through

long-term suppression of autoantibody production, or repopulation
of FceRI, which is recognized as “self” by the immune system.
At baseline, 8 subjects had a positive autologous skin test
result, 3 had a negative test, and | test was not performed. Test
results remained positive in 3 patients who remitted and whose
histamine release assay turned negative. The serum factors
responsible are not clear because no serum fractionation has
been performed to ascertain the molecular species responsible.
Thus, it is possible that factors other than IgG anti-FceRI (eg,
immunoglobulin of other classes or alternative antibodies) may be
responsible for positive skin test results. It is also possible that
compared with circulating basophils used in the histamine release
assay, there is a slower turnover of FceRI on tissue resident cells.
Future studies should include a larger number of patients and
have a double-blind placebo-controlled design. In addition,
studies of patients without associated autoimmune phenomena
should be conducted to determine whether the findings reported
here can be extended to the larger population of patients with
chronic urticaria that is not thought to be autoimmune in nature.

We thank Ms Robin Bostick for her excellent assistance in the administra
tion of omalizumab and follow-up of patients in this study.

 

Clinical implications: Omalizumab may be useful for treatment
of patients with CAU not responsive to antihistamines. Further

studies should be performed to confirm these findings in CAU
and to assess efficacy in other forms of chronic urticaria.
