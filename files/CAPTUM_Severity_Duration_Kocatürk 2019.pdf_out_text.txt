Patient reported outcomes used in 81 CSU and 78 CINDU patients. Dermatology life quality index (DLQI), Chronic urticaria quality of life
questionnaire (CU-Q2oL), urticaria activity score (UAS), patients' and physicians’ global assessment visual analog
scores and Likert scales were used at baseline and after four weeks to assess quality of life impairment, disease
activity and disease control. Statistical analysis to determine the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of
the UCT as well as comparison between CINDU and CSU patients were performed.
Results: Duration of disease was longer, disease control was poorer and severe complaints were more frequent in
CINDU patients (duration of disease: 36.3 (24) + 49.1 vs 31.5 (9) + 67.9, p = .007, UCT baseline: 8.4 (8) + 3.4 vs
10.4 (11) + 3.9, p = .001 and patient's global assessment Likert scale severe complaints: 6 vs 15, p < .001,
respectively). The UCT showed excellent internal consistency for CSU and a minimally acceptable consistency for
CINDU (Cronbach's « 0.89 for CSU versus 0.68 for CINDU). It showed strong correlation with CU-Q2oL but a
moderate correlation with DLQI (r = —0.649, P < .001 and r = —0.545, P < .001, respectively). It was able to
discriminate between patients with different disease control and was sensitive to detect changes in the disease
control in both groups. The minimally important difference of the UCT was found to be 3.
Conclusions: The Turkish version of the UCT is a valid and reliable tool for the management of CU patients and can
be used both in CSU and CINDU patients to determine if the treatment is sufficient and if disease activity and
quality of life impairment are under control or not.

disease status. This makes it difficult for physicians to estimate patients’
disease activity and disease burden, and to adjust treatment accordingly.

To overcome this obstacle, several patient-reported outcome (PRO)
measures have been developed for CU patients in the recent years,
including the Urticaria Activity Score (UAS),” “ the Angioedema Activity
Score (AAS),° Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life questionnaire
(CU-Q2oL),°'° the Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire,''!? the
Urticaria Activity and Impact Measure,'* and the Urticaria Control Test
(ucT).!* i Among these tools, UCT is the easiest and least
time-consuming. It was specifically designed to retrospectively assess the
level of disease control in CU patients and thereby aid to evaluate the
control of various types of urticaria and decision of treatment change.!“
In addition, it overcomes some of the limitations of the UAS and AAS.
First, it is a retrospective instrument that works in all types of physician
consultations (largely independently of patient compliance). Second, it is
a tool for all types of chronic urticaria (not only for CSU), and third, it can
also be used in urticaria patients with recurrent angioedema.

The UCT includes four simple questions that assess the control of
signs and symptoms of the disease, quality of life (QoL) impairment, efficacy of treatment and overall disease control, over the prior 4 weeks. It
is completed by the patient and can be evaluated by both the patient and
the physician. The questions are rated from 0 to 4, and the total score is
calculated by summing the four individual question scores. The lowest
UCT score possible is 0 (no control) and the highest score possible is 16
(complete control). A score of >12 indicates well-controlled urticaria,
while a score of <11 indicates poor disease control.!4

The current study aimed to investigate the validity, reliability and
sensitivity to change of the Turkish version of the UCT in both CSU and
CINDU. We also compared the UCT results of patients with CSU and
patients with CINDU.

Methods
Patients

Turkish patients with CU (N = 159, 18-75 years, 67.9% females)
attending the Urticaria Clinic of the Urticaria Centre of Reference and

Excellence~’ at the Department of Dermatology Okmeydam Training and
Research Hospital participated in this study. A total of 81 CSU and 78

 

World Allergy Organization Journal 12 (2019) 100009

CINDU patients were included and the subtypes of CINDU were symptomatic dermographism (56), cholinergic urticaria,’ cold urticaria,°
aquagenic urticaria’ and mixed CINDU (eg; symptomatic dermographism
plus cold urticaria in a patient).®

All patients were assessed at three visits in 4-week intervals; baseline,
1st and 2nd visit. The flow of the study and the questionnaires given are
shown in Fig. 1. During each visit, the participants received appropriate
treatment according to their disease activity and control as recommended by the EAACI/ GA2LEN/EDF/WAO guideline.’ The study was
approved by the ethics committee of Okmeydani Training and Research
Hospital and it was performed in line with institutional guidelines and
regulations. Informed consent to be included in the study and consent to
publish pseudonymized data were taken from the participants.

Translation and linguistic validation of the Turkish UCT version

To obtain a linguistically validated Turkish version of the UCT, a
structured forward-backward translation was performed. The original
English version of the UCT was independently translated into Turkish by
two native Turkish speakers with a command of English language. Then,
these two Turkish versions were reviewed for comprehensibility by dermatologists specialized in treating urticaria patients (Kocatiirk, Kiziltac,
Can). After these dermatologists reached consensus, the final Turkish
version was back-translated into German by two independent bilingual
translators. The back-translated versions were then reviewed against the
original by the original authors. Potential misconceptions or misinterpretations introduced in the translation process were discussed between the Turkish research team and the original authors. After consensus
on the final Turkish version was achieved, the Turkish version of UCT was
tested in 10 CU patients (cognitive debriefing interviews). Here, it was
recognized that the patients were incapable of understanding the third
question of the UCT “How often was the treatment for your urticaria in the
last 4 weeks not enough to control your urticaria symptoms?” which was
answered as “very often”, “often”, “sometimes”, “seldom” and “not at all”.
This was attributed to the reverse nature of the question and then it was
changed as “How successful was the treatment for your urticaria in controlling your urticaria symptoms in the last 4 weeks?” with the answers
“not at all”, “a little”, “somewhat”, “well” and “very well”. Subsequently,
the final Turkish version of UCT was used for this study.

Clinical measures

The weekly Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7): The UAS7 is a prospective
diary-type tool to assess disease activity of CSU patients for one week.” “
It is based on the once-daily assessment of itch intensity/severity and
numbers of hives over a period of 7 days. It sums up the number of wheals
and the intensity of pruritus on a four-point scale (0-3) with a minimum
and maximum score of 0 and 6 points per day, respectively. The UAS7
ranges from 0 to 42. The UAS28 is the sum of the UAS7 scores of 4
consecutive weeks (range from 0 to 168).7°

The validated Turkish version of the Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life
Questionnaire (CU-Q2oL): The CU-Q2o0L was specifically designed for the
assessment of health-related quality of life impairment in patients with
CU, including the physical, psychosocial and practical aspects of this
condition.°” A total of 23 questions were found to cover six key
CU-specific domains: itch, swelling, impact on life activities, sleep
problems, looks and limits. For each question, patients were asked to
choose between five response options (scored 0-4) indicating the intensity of each item in the last two weeks. A total score across all questions was calculated and transformed into scores ranging from 0 to 100,
with a score of 100 indicating the worst possible health related quality of
life (HRQoL) impairment. Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) was
used for the CINDU patients since the CU-Q2oL was specifically designed
for CSU patients.

The Physician's global assessment of disease control - visual analog scale
(PhyGA-VAS) is a physician evaluation instrument for assessing urticaria
control during the last four weeks.!“ It is a 10-cm unmarked line which
ranges between 0 cm (not at all under control) and 10 cm (completely
under control).

The Physician's global assessment of disease control - Likert-scale (PhyGALS) was used to assess disease control ona 5-point scale (1 complete control,
2 good control, 3 moderate control, 4 little control, 5 no control).!4

The Patient's global assessment of disease severity-visual analog scale
(PatGA-VAS) was used to assess disease severity during the previous four
weeks.'* The PatGA-VAS is an unmarked line anchored at the two ends
with “no complaints” (0 cm) and “maximal complaints” (10 cm).

The Patient's global assessment of disease severity - Likert scale (PatGALS) was used to assess disease severity during the previous four weeks.'*
The PatGA-LS is a 5-point scale for assessing disease control (1 no complaints, 2 mild complaints, 3 moderate complaints 4 severe complaints)

The Physician's assessment of treatment response (Phy-ATR) is a physician evaluation instrument for assessing a patient's response to treatment
during the last four weeks.’ The physician evaluates the adequacy of
treatment as sufficient or not sufficient (treatment sufficient = 0, treatment not sufficient = 1).

The Patient's assessment of treatment response — Likert scale (Pat-ATR) is
a patient evaluation instrument for assessing treatment during the last
four weeks.’ The patient evaluates the adequacy of treatment as sufficient or not sufficient (treatment sufficient = 0, treatment not
sufficient = 1).

The Patient's assessment of change in disease activity — Likert scale (PatCDA) is a patient evaluation instrument for assessing change in disease
activity during the last four weeks (Significant improvement = 0, mild
improvement = 1, no change = 2, mild worsening = 3, significant
worsening = 4).\4

The Patient's assessment of change in quality of life — Likert scale (PatCQoL) is a patient evaluation instrument for assessing change in quality
of life during the last four weeks (significant improvement = 0, mild
improvement = 1, no change = 2, mild worsening = 3, significant
worsening = 4).\4

Assessment of the Turkish UCT consistency, validity, sensitivity to change,
reliability, and screening accuracy

Internal consistency: Cronbach's « coefficient was used to test the internal consistency of the Turkish UCT. We used the suggested guidelines

World Allergy Organization Journal 12 (2019) 100009

for interpretation of Cronbach's « coefficient: < 0.60 unacceptable,
0.60-0.65 undesirable, 0.65-0.70 minimally acceptable, 0.70-0.80
respectable, 0.80-0.90 excellent and >0.90 excessive consistency.”*

Convergent validity assesses whether measures that should be related
are related. The correlation between the Turkish version of UCT and CUQ2oL, DLQI, UAS28, PhyGA-VAS, PatGA-VAS, and PatGA-LS were evaluated by Pearson's correlation coefficient. Weak, moderate and strong
correlations were defined as correlation coefficient values of <0.3,
0.3-0.6, and >0.6 respectively. '“

Known-groups validity measures the ability of the tool to discriminate
between patients with different disease severity and disease control. The
known-group validity of the Turkish UCT was explored by using the
Kruskal Wallis test. The UAS28 scores of <6, 7-24, 25-64, >65 were used
to classify the disease activity of the patients into none, mild, moderate
and severe, respectively.“ To determine patients with different levels of
disease control PatGA-LS and PhyGA-LS were used and patients with
different levels of treatment responses were determined by using
Pat-ATR and Phy-ATR.

Sensitivity to change: All of the patients returned for a second visit. The
changes in the UCT scores and UAS28, CU-Q2oL, DLQI, PatGA-VAS and
PhyGA-VAS change scores between the two visits were calculated and the
correlation between the changes in these variables was analysed
(computing of rank correlation coefficient Spearman's rho).

Test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient - ICC): To determine the UCT's test-retest reliability patients who had no change in the
PatGA-LS scores (stable patients) during the four-week interval between
the 1st and the 2nd visit were included in the analysis for test-retest
reliability. UCT scores of patients with CINDU and CSU and total were
compared between two visits by using Wilcoxon signed rank test. An ICC
of 0.5-0.7 indicated moderate-to-good reproducibility while an ICC of
greater than 0.7 was considered to demonstrate excellent
reproducibility.“

Screening accuracy (categorization): Screening accuracy (categorization) is the ability of UCT to categorize patients into suffering from
poorly-controlled and well-controlled disease. ROC curve analysis and
area under the curve (AUC) were used to determine screening accuracy of
the UCT. PhyGA-LS was categorized into well-controlled and poorly
controlled urticaria for ROC curve analysis. Good control or complete
control were accepted as well-controlled urticaria whereas no control,
little control, or moderate control were considered as poorly controlled
urticaria. The cut off values for well-controlled urticaria versus poor
controlled urticaria were determined for both visits. AUCs of 1, 0.9, 0.8,
0.7, and 0.5 were defined as perfect, excellent, good, fair, and no better
than chance, respectively.'°

Minimal important difference (MID), minimal clinically important
difference and smallest detectable change (SDC) of the Turkish UCT

Anchor based, and distributional-criterion approaches were applied
to calculate the MID which is the change in a score that can be considered
clinically relevant.!° Anchor based methods include the mean change
method and ROC curve analysis.”!°° A ROC curve analysis was applied
and the Phy-GA-LS was used as an external anchor for the anchor-based
methods. To use Phy-GA-LS as an anchor, the correlation between UCT
score changes and Phy-GA-LS changes were determined (Spearman's
correlation). At least good correlation (r ~ 0.5) should be determined in
order to use the Phy-GA-LS as an anchor. Patients were classified into
“improved” disease (>1st step improvement in Phy-GA-LS) and “not
improved” disease (unchanged or worsened Phy-GA-LS) in order to
determine the cut-off value of UCT changes. The ROC cut-off point was
chosen by getting smallest sum of percentages of false positive and false
negative classifications ([1-sensitivity] + [1-specificity]).?° The mean
change approach was applied, and the mean UCT score improvement was
determined in patients with a 1st step improvement in their Phy-GA-LS
from 1st visit to 2nd.”'° Another method to calculate MID indirectly is
the distributional-criterion approach which can be calculated by dividing

Besides the MID, the smallest detectable change of the UCT score was
also calculated.”'° The SDC was analysed as 1.96 times the SD of the
UCT's score changes between two visits in patients whose Phy-GA-LS was
stable.

Results
Duration of disease, disease control and patients’ complaints

Duration of disease was longer, disease control was poorer, severe complaints were more frequent in CINDU patients. The demographic characteristics of the patients and the scores of the instruments used through the
study are shown in Table 1. The table shows significant differences between the two groups; CSU and CINDU. See also Table 4 for details of
PatGA-LS, PhyGA-LS, Pat-ATR, Phy-ATR distributions between CSU and
CINDU.

The internal consistency for CSU and CINDU

The UCT showed excellent internal consistency for CSU and a minimally
acceptable internal consistency for CINDU. When calculated for the total
patient population (both CSU and CINDU), the Cronbach's « was found
0.81. But when analysed separately, the Cronbach's « was found 0.89
versus 0.68 for CSU and CINDU patients respectively (Table 2).

Correlations of UCT with other tools

The UCT showed strong correlation with CU-Q2oL but a moderate correlation with DLQI. The UCT scores of the total patient population (CSU
and CINDU) showed strong correlations with disease severity (PatGAVAS, PatGA-LS) and disease control (PhyGA-VAS, PhyGA-LS). UCT scores
of CSU patients showed a strong negative correlation with disease

The UCT showed similar known groups validity for CSU and CINDU patients. The UCT was able to discriminate between groups with different
disease severity (demonstrated by PatGA-LS) and different levels of disease control (demonstrated by PhyGA-LS) (p = 0,000). Patients with
different disease severity had different UCT scores. Even though there
were slight differences between CSU and CINDU patients, the overall
known groups validity was similar (Table 4). A higher number of CINDU
patients rated their symptoms as severe complaints (PatGA-LS-1st 15 vs 6
in CINDU and CSU, respectively).

The sensitivity to change of the UCT

The UCT was sensitive to detect changes in disease activity and quality of
life. The correlations between change in UCT scores and UAS28, CUQ2oL, DLQI, PATGA-VAS and PhyGA-VAS change scores were statistically significant for both CSU and CINDU (p < .01).

Change in UCT scores have a moderate correlation with PhyGA-VASchange (r = 0.573), strong correlations with PatGA-LS change
(r = —0.632), PhyGA-LS change (r = —0.713) and PatGA-VAS change
(—0.623) in total. Change in UCT scores have moderate correlations with
UAS28 change (r = —0.598), CU-Q2oL change (r = —0.543) and PhyGAVAS change (r = 0.570), strong correlations with PatGA-VAS change
(r = —0.633), PatGA-LS change (r = —0.689), PhyGA-LS change
(r = —0.612) in the CSU group, while change in UCT scores have moderate correlations with DLQI change (r = —0.543), PatGA-LS change
(r = —0.511), PatGA-VAS change (r = —0.556), PhyGA-VAS change
(r = 0.523) and a strong correlation with PhyGA-LS change (r = —0.752)
in CINDU patients.

The reproducibility of the Turkish UCT

The Turkish UCT showed excellent reproducibility. Seventy patients (34
CSU patients and 36 CINDU patients) who had stable PatGA-LS scores
during the four-week interval between the Ist and the 2nd visits were
included into analysis of test-retest reliability. ICC of UCT in CSU and
CINDU were analysed separately and also totally. The ICCs of UCT in
patients with CSU and CINDU were 0.89 (95% confidence
interval = 0.79-0.95) and 0.74 (95% confidence interval = 0.50-0.87),
respectively, that demonstrated excellent reproducibility of both UCTs.
ICC was 0.83 (95% confidence interval = 0.72-0.89) showing excellent
reproducibility of Turkish UCT when it is determined totally.

Screening accuracy (categorization)

Seventy-two and 101 patients had well-controlled urticaria by using
PhyGA-LS at 1st and 2nd visits, respectively. The AUCs on ROC analyses
showed excellent accuracy of both visits of Turkish UCT (Table 5)
(Fig. 2). UCT scores of >9,5 (sensitivity 84.7%, specificity 85.1%) and
>11.5 (sensitivity 93.1%, specificity 91.4%) were found to be suitable
cut off values to define well-controlled disease for the 1st and the 2nd
visits, respectively. When the CSU and CINDU groups were analysed
separately, UCT scores of >10.5 and > 11.5 were defined for CINDU
patients, >8.5 and > 10.5 were defined for CSU patients for the 1st and
2nd visits, respectively.

Minimal important difference (MID) and smallest detectable change (SDC)
of the UCT

The mean UCT score change in cases of minimal improvement (1 step
improvement in Phy-GA-LS) was found to be 4.2 + 3.0 points, while
mean UCT score change in cases of an unchanged Phy-GA-LS was only
0.6 + 2.2 points. This mean change method indicated that MID is 4, while
the distributional-criterion approach determined MID as 1.9 (the SD of
the baseline UCT scores (3.8) was divided by 2). The Phy-GA-LS change
and UCT score change showed strong correlation (r = —0.713, p < .01).

On the ROC curve analysis, UCT score change was determined by
improved disease versus not improved disease. AUC was 0.896
(0.841-950) (95% CI) and UCT change score that identifies improved
disease was 2.5 (sensitivity 82.5%, specificity 87.5%). Sixty-seven patients had stable Phy-GA-LS between two visits and the SD of the UCT's
score changes in patients with stable Phy-GA-LS was 2.2 and SDC was
4.3.

Discussion

The UCT is a simple and easy to use patient-reported outcome (PRO)
tool which was originally developed to determine disease control in CU
patients.'“ The linguistic adaptation and validation studies have been
performed in Thai, Arabic and Spanish.'*'”'® We performed the recommended steps for validation of PRO-tools rigorously for the Turkish
UCT and we determined the reliability, validity, sensitivity to change and
minimally important difference (MID) of the tool.?°

We found that UCT scores were lower in the CINDU group at referral
(8.4 in CINDU vs 10.4 in CSU, p = .001) and PhyGA-VAS was also lower
in the CINDU group compared to CSU group (5.5 vs 8.1, p < .001).
PatGA-VAS were higher (4.9 vs 3.1; p < .001) and Pat-ATR and Phy-ATR
were lower in CINDU compared to CSU (29 vs 53, p < .001 and 19 vs 52,
p < .001, respectively). Most of the CSU patients rated their disease activity as mild (34 patients) while most of the CINDU patients rated as
moderate (40 patients), severe activity was rated by 6 of the CSU patients
while 15 of CINDU patients rated themselves as severe. Nineteen patients
with CSU reported complete control of urticaria while only one patient
with CINDU reported complete control. These findings suggest a higher
disease impact and poorer control of urticaria in CINDU patients which
might be associated with the longer disease duration in these patients
(36.3 vs 31.5 months in CINDU and CSU patients, respectively). Since we
had to use different QoL measures to assess QoL impairment in CSU and
CINDU patients we are not able to make a direct comparison between the
QoL impairment of CSU and CINDU patients but we could get some information from the second question of UCT which provides information
on how the disease impacted the quality of life of the patient. Twentyfour patients with CINDU while 13 patients with CSU reported to have
their quality of life impairment as “much and very much effected” by
urticaria which are in parallel to the findings of O'Donnell et al. and Poon
et al. who described poorer quality of life in patients with delayed
pressure urticaria and cholinergic urticaria and with Schoepke et al. who
reported that quality of life significantly impaired in 44% and normal life
not possible in 7% of symptomatic dermographism patients.”” *°

The Turkish version of UCT showed excellent consistency for CSU
which was higher than the original tool (Cronbach's « original versus
Turkish 0.84 vs 0.89) and a minimally acceptable consistency for CINDU
(Cronbach's « 0.89 vs 0.68). The reason for this might be the nature of
CINDU that shows exaggeration with exposure to the specific trigger and
moderation with avoidance which makes it hard to assess the disease
E. Kocatiirk et al.

activity without making the critical trigger threshold (CTT) measurement.!° It is unfortunate that by employing the short version of UCT, we
missed the chance to ask the question of “How much, in the last 4 weeks,
did you have to avoid physical exercise or stimuli such as heat, cold,
pressure light or friction because of your urticaria?” to CINDU patients
which is included in the long version of the UCT.'‘ By asking this
question, maybe we could get a thorough assessment of the activity of the
disease.

The evaluation for the correlation between other tools revealed that
the UCT showed strong negative correlations with the UAS28, CU-Q2oL,
Pat-GA-VAS, Phy-GA-VAS and Pat-LS and a strong positive correlation
with Phy-GA-LS which is because higher scores of the former tools are
linked to higher disease activity and poor control. The DLQI showed a
moderate negative correlation with the UCT. We believe this is again due
to the difficulty to assess disease impact in CINDU patients and could also
be linked to the differences in the period of assessment times which assesses the last 4 weeks in UCT and the last week for DLQI. Although a
study from Japan showed good correlation with UCT and DLQI in CU,°°
since DLQI is not a disease specific tool which is designed specifically for
CINDU, it might not be able to show the real impact on QoL impairment
of CINDU patients. As the CU-Q2oL has been reported to be more sensitive in comparison with DLQI to reflect QoL impairment in CSU, certain
disease specific questionnaires are needed to assess QoL in patients with
CINDU™'.

UCT also showed to be sensitive to changes in disease activity in both
CSU and CINDU patients. The test-retest reliability showed excellent
reproducibility for both CSU and CINDU patients but there was a clear
superiority for CSU patients (first visit UCT 12.4 vs 12.2 for CSU, 8.9 vs
10.9 for CINDU, respectively). At baseline, the mean UCT scores of
CINDU patients were lower than the CSU patients (8.4 vs 10.4, respectively) but after treatment, the total scores clearly increased at the follow
up visit (11.7 for CSU and 11.4 for CINDU, respectively). The lower
reproducibility of UCT for CINDU could be attributed to its changeability
according to avoidance behaviours.

Here we report that the UCT is also suited to determine changes in
disease control over time and to assess treatment effects (that it is
responsive to change). Our results demonstrate that changes in the UCT
score strongly correlate with disease-specific assessments of changes in
urticaria activity (UAS7) and HR-QoL (CU-Q2o0L), while the correlation
with changes in the less-specific DLQI are less strong (but still good).
Importantly, the change of UCT ratings from “poorly controlled’”’ to
“well-controlled” was well in accordance with the change of the patients'
self-assessment of treatment efficacy, with the physicians’ global assessment of the treatment response, and with the UAS7-based assessment of
treatment response. This supports the appropriateness of the current UCT
cut-off value of >12 points to detect patients with well-controlled
urticaria.

MID is the smallest change in a score that can be considered clinically
relevant and the knowledge of the MID of an outcome measure is
important for the interpretation of changes in its score by time or after
treatment. By using the mean change method we found an MID of 4 and
with the ROC curve analysis UCT change score that identifies improved
disease was found 2.5. Like the other investigators'“'° we regarded an
MID 3 points as the most appropriate for UCT score changes.

We unfortunately have some limitations in this study; even though
the test-retest reliability analysis should be done in patients without
change in disease activity, since we could not keep patients without
treatment for one month, we had to give treatment and the disease activities decreased. For this reason, test-retest reliability could only be
performed in 34 CSU and 42 CINDU patients. And by using the long
version of UCT we could have evaluated the avoidance behaviours of the
CINDU patients and thoroughly assess the impact and activity of CINDU.
Another point is using SF-36 instead of DLQI could be more effective in
showing the QoL impairment in patients with CINDU because it has a
physical functioning domain which measures the repercussion of
possible physical limitations on daily activities such as taking a bath,

World Allergy Organization Journal 12 (2019) 100009

dressing, walking moderate distances, running, climbing stairs, carrying
bags, bending over and kneeling.°”

As a conclusion, the UCT is a valuable tool which aids in treatment
decisions, allowing to assess whether the disease is controlled by two
aspects; namely both in severity and quality of life impairment and the
Turkish version of UCT is shown to be valid and reliable for both CSU and
CINDU patients.
