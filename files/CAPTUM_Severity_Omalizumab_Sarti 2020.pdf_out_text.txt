Methods: The electronic charts of patients diagnosed with CSU and referred to the
Allergy Unit of Meyer Children's University hospital were reviewed during a period of
4 years. For each patient, an examination of demographic characteristics, diagnostic
workup, efficacy, and tolerability of the treatment was performed. Disease activity
was monitored using UAS7.
Results: Sixty-six cases of CSU were identified, and all of them were treated initially
with a standard dose of sgAH,s, followed by increased doses up to fourfold when
standard dosing was not effective. 44/66 patients (66.7%) treated with sgAH;s responded: 25 witha standard dose, 16 with a double, 2 with threefold dose, and 1 with
fourfold dose. 12/66 (18.2%) patients began a therapy with omalizumab. As for the
remaining patients, 10/66 (15.1%), they are still undergoing therapy with sgAH,s because of the relapse of the symptoms after the stepped-down dosage. Regarding tolerability, 9/66 (13.6%) patients treated with sgAH,s experienced side effects: three
that required treatment change and six that did not.
Conclusion: Our data were consistent with the tolerability of updosing of sgAH,s in
children with CSU, although the efficacy appears to be limited to double the standard
dose.

1 | INTRODUCTION

Urticaria is a common skin disease that the EAACI/GA7LEN/EDF/
WAO guidelines define as a condition characterized by the development of wheals, angioedema, or both. It can be differentiated
into two forms: acute urticaria with a duration of up to 6 weeks and
chronic urticaria (CU) with a duration of more than 6 weeks?.

International guidelines recommend that urticaria should be
classified as spontaneous (no specific eliciting factor involved) or inducible (specific eliciting factor involved)’. Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) affects 0.5%-1% of the general population*. Data about
the epidemiology and management of CU in children are limited. In
a recent study, the prevalence of CU and CSU in the pediatric population was found to be 1.38% and 0.75%, respectively, across five
European countries’.

Recent EAACI guidelines for management of CSU recommend a
stepwise treatment approach in children similar to adults’, as in previous studies*. They recommend second-generation non-sedating
H1 antihistamines (sgAH;,s) as the first line of treatment in children
(weight-adjusted) as in adults, followed by an increased dose (up to 4
times) if the standard dose is not effective’.

To monitor disease activity, recording the daily wheal number
and pruritus severity using a standardized 7-day Urticaria Activity
Score (UAS7) is recommended’.

The sgAH,s (e.g., cetirizine, desloratadine, levocetirizine, rupatadine, and loratadine) have been shown to provide long-term safety
in the pediatric population for use in treating allergy diseases, such
as allergic rhinitis'?*°, Recently, three randomized controlled trials
(RCT) established the safety of second-generation non-sedating H1

Uit1415

antihistamines in C as well. While the efficacy of updosing

fourfold the standard dose is known in adults'®7”, there is a substantial knowledge gap regarding the efficacy and safety of updosing in
the pediatric population’®.

This retrospective study evaluates the efficacy and tolerability
of the updosing of sgAH,s in children with CSU in a tertiary care

pediatric hospital.

2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS

We retrospectively reviewed the electronic charts of patients referred to our Allergy Unit from September 2015 to December 2019
for CSU, defined by the presence of wheals, angioedema, or both
daily or almost daily for more than 6 weeks.

We collected data concerning demographic characteristics, diagnostic workups, and treatments for each patient, carrying out a
cross-sectional analysis regarding the real-life clinical experience of

our center. Patients with a diagnosis of CSU were included; instead,

Key Message

Our study aims to increase knowledge about the efficacy
and safety of the use of second-generation non-sedating
H1 antihistamines at higher doses than the standard dose
in the pediatric population, an area in which the literature
is still scarce. We analyzed the tolerability and efficacy of
these drugs at each single dose increase recommended by
the most recent EAACI guidelines for the management of
chronic urticaria (until fourfold). Our results showed that
these drugs are safe but that their efficacy seems limited to
the double dose; in fact, most children who have reached
higher dosages have not seen an improvement in clinical
manifestations and have needed a further modification of

the therapy with the use of omalizumab.

patients with history of inducible CU, recurrent urticaria, and with
urticaria elicited by an lgE-mediated allergy reaction were excluded.

Our CU management protocol consisted of the following: (a) detailed collection of clinical, family, and personal medical history and
information about spontaneous or inducible CU; (b) performance
of a skin prick test (SPT) for the most common food or other allergens and aeroallergens where indicated by the patient's clinical
history (e.g., correlation of appearance of wheals with the ingestion
of foods or drugs, history of rhinitis or asthma); and (c) blood and
stool tests for the investigation of autoimmune or infective triggers
of CU. The selection of tests to perform was guided by the patient's
medical history and age. All patients were tested for blood count,
thyroid hormones, and celiac disease because pathologies related
to alteration of these parameters can be initially asymptomatic.

During the first visit to our allergy unit, if the diagnosis of CSU was
confirmed, we prescribed the standard dose of sgAH;,s antihistamines.
In those patients where the standard dose had already been initiated
for at least 2 weeks, we increased the dose to twofold. In accordance
with international guidelines', we increased the dose of sgAH;,s up to 4
times if the standard dose was not effective. Finally, in those patients
for whom the sgAH,s were not effective, we began a trial with omalizumab. The disease activity was monitored using the UAS7.

Patients were considered complete responders when the UAS7
scale had a score of O for at least 2 weeks. In these patients, a stepping down in the treatment was prescribed. Conversely, non-responder patients were defined as those who continued to have
symptoms despite treatment, in particular in cases of a UAS7 score
higher than 15 for at least 2 weeks, when a stepping up of the therapy was performed. Among these patients, a UAS7 score of 16-27

configured a moderate disease while a UAS7 score greater than
27 configured a severe disease. Finally, in patients exhibiting improvement without recovery from symptoms (partial responders),
where UAS7 score was between 1 and 6 (well-controlled disease)
or 7 and 15 (mild disease), the same dosage was maintained for an
extended period of time. Depending upon their UAS7 in the follow-up, the treatment was stepped-down if they reached a UAS7
score of O or stepped up if they reached a UAS7 score greater than
15. This therapeutic approach on the basis of UAS7 scale is shown
in Figure 1.

Once the data regarding treatment were collected, the general
complete response rate to sgAH,s was established. This rate corresponded to the percentage of patients who recovered with any
dosage of sgAH,s, without the need of other treatments. The response rate for each sgAH,s dosage was established as well. The
partial response rate included the percentage of patients who were
receiving maintenance treatment (UAS 1-15). Finally, we estimated
the mean time of treatment in patients that recovered as well as the
mean time of updose.

During review of electronic charts, we noted any adverse effects
to the therapy, and if found, we noted the doses at which the effects
occurred. Of note, in our clinical practice, we managed frequent
telephone and email contacts with the families during the treatment
period. Furthermore, they were instructed to contact us at the emergency number in case of appearance of side effects to the treatment
and/or poor efficacy of the therapy.

After the collection of data, we recalled patients for whom the
electronic charts were not specifying information about the tolerability of the sgAH,s. During these phone calls, we asked parents if,
during the period of therapy, they had noticed any adverse effects,
such as drowsiness, in their children. In cases where adverse effects
were noticed, we asked the parents to describe the dose at which
the effects were noticed and whether or not the problem interfered
with the normal daily life of their children.

As an additional point of information, we asked the parents of
those children who showed remission of urticaria if they experienced any other urticarial manifestations after the end of their therapy and after the last visit to our Allergy Unit.

The mean time of follow-up and standard deviation (SD), from
the first visit in our Allergy Unit to the last telephone call, was
37 + 26.9 months.

For statistics, we used SPSS for Windows version 16.0.

(10.3%) showed an infectious disease as a possible trigger of urticaria. Detailed data about the results of blood and stool tests are

shown in Table 2.

3.2 | Treatments

For treatment, we followed current European Academy of Allergy
and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) international guidelines*. Hence,
the aim was to treat the disease until its resolution, following the
basic principle of treating “as much as needed and as little as possible.” This goal required an adequate and dynamic stepping up or

stepping down in the treatment algorithm.

In accordance with the latest international EAACI guidelines?,
all 68 patients were initially treated with sgAH,s at the standard
dose. In only 2/68 patients (2.9%), the sgAH,s therapy was stopped
quickly because of the resolution of the urticaria with the treatment
of an underlying condition: in one case of autoimmune thyroiditis,
we observed a resolution of the symptoms at the onset of treatment
with levothyroxine, and in the second case, we observed the resolution with anti-parasite treatment.

In patients <12 years of age, the prescribed sgAH,s was cetirizine. In patients over 12 years of age, we prescribed cetirizine and
rupatadine equally.

Thirty-seven/66 patients (56.1%) not responding to the
standard dose of the sgAH,s were started on updosing up to 4
times the standard dose. Details of the updosing are shown in
Figure 2. In the patients who were not responding to the updosing of sgAH,s, we prescribed omalizumab, as recommended by

the guidelines?.

3.3 | Efficacy of second-generation non-sedating
anti H1

After beginning treatment with the standard dose of the sgAH,s,
25/66 patients (37.9%) went into remission. The mean treatment
duration (+SD) was 8.5 + 10.3 months. Four/66 patients (6.1%) are
still undergoing therapy with a standard dose because of a relapse of
symptoms after the end of the original therapy (Figure 2).

Thirty-seven/66 (56.1%) patients were treated with double the
standard dose of sgAH,s. Of these patients, 16/37 (43.2% of patients who started with double the dose and 24.2% of all the patients)
were complete responders. The mean treatment duration (+SD) was
15.5 + 20.2 months. Six/37 (16.2%) patients are still undergoing therapy with double the standard dose because of a relapse of symptoms
after the stepping down of the dosage.

In 15/66 patients, (22.7%) were prescribed a threefold dose of
sgAH\1s, and in this group, 2/15 (13.3%) were complete responders.
The mean treatment duration (+SD) was 52.5 + 61.5 months. As for the
remaining subjects, 6/15 (40.0%) started the fourfold dose of sgAH,s
and only 1 went into remission, during a treatment period of 1 year.
These patients had a UAS7 score higher than 15 but lower than 27 for
at least 2 weeks. Moreover, 7/15 (46.7%) patients were started directly
with omalizumab and our treatment choice was guided by the fact that
UAS7 score remained high (>27) for at least 2 weeks (severe urticaria).

In summary, the general complete response rate to sgAH,s was
66.7% (44/66 complete responders with UAS = 0) and the partial
response rate was 15.1% (10/66 partial responders, UAS = 1-15).

A total of 12/66 (18.2%) patients non-responders to sgAH,
at any dosage started treatment with omalizumab, 5/12 from a

therapy with a fourfold dose of sgAH,s, and 7/12 directly from a
therapy with a threefold dose of sgAH,s. Of these patients, one was
not included in the final data since the therapy was ended quickly
because of social and economic problems. Concerning the other 11
patients, 6 (54.5% of patients who started therapy with omalizumab
and 9.1 % of all the patients enrolled) were complete responders.
The other 5 patients are still undergoing therapy with sgAH,s after
the end of omalizumab. Four/5 patients were able to tolerate a reduction of the daily dose of the sgAH,s until reaching the standard
dose with significant improvement in their UAS7 scores; only one
patient continued to be treated with sgAH,s at the fourfold dose
after the end of therapy with omalizumab because of a relapse in
symptoms when a stepped-down dosage was tried. In this case, we
observed a decrease of UAS7 score (<15) after the end of omalizumab therapy.

During telephone interviews, all parents of patients who went into
remission confirmed that there were no recurrences of the CSU. In
only 10/44 (22.7%) cases after therapy had ended, patients experienced symptoms of acute urticaria, during intercurrent infections or
periods of stress, which were treated with a single dose of sgAH,s for
a short period of treatment (less than 7 days).

3.4 | Tolerability of the second-generation nonsedating anti H1

During the review of the electronic charts, we identified a total of
9/66 (13.6%) patients experienced side effects during the treatment with sgAH,s. In 10/66 (15.2%) cases, electronic charts were

not specifying information about the tolerability of the sgAH,s. For
this reason, we recalled the patients after the collection of the data.

Three/66 patients (4.5%) treated with sgAH,s at the standard
dose experienced side effects: one with isolated headache; one with
headache, drowsiness, and enuresis; and the last one with vertigo.
All side effects occurred during cetirizine treatment and regressed
with rupatadine. In the group of patients treated with sgAH,s at
double the standard dose, only 2/37 (5.4%) patients experienced
side effects (both with cetirizine): one with drowsiness and one with
mild headache; however, the side effects did not change the patient's normal daily activity. Four/15 patients (26.7%) who reached
triple dosing experienced side effects, all with drowsiness and all
with the use of cetirizine; also, in these cases it was not necessary
to change the therapy because drowsiness did not alter the patient's

daily activities.

4 | DISCUSSION

This cross-sectional study carried out ina tertiary care pediatric hospital evaluates the real-life management of patients with CSU, from
the diagnostic workup to the efficacy and tolerability of the up dosing of sgAH,s.

In agreement with Carrillo-Martin et al.’’, the results of our study
show that tests performed for chronic urticaria/ angioedema rarely
highlight underlying pathologies or lead to changes in its management or results from the clinical point of view. In fact, only 25% of 68
patients showed laboratory tests indicative of an underlying disease,
and among these, only 8% showed a resolution of symptoms after
specific treatment for this disease. In particular, 35% of the patients
with laboratory tests indicative of an underlying disease showed a
dysfunctional state of thyroid gland, and among these, only one patient experienced symptom resolution after initiating a therapy for
hypothyroidism. Furthermore, in the study of Carrillo-Martin et al.”
it is emphasized that the laboratory tests performed substantially
increase the costs generated by the disease. Therefore, we are in
agreement with the authors that adherence to the current recommendations to limit the number of tests to be performed in cases
of CU could help to reduce the economic impact of CU/angioedema
and optimize the care pathways related to this pathology.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study conducted in
a pediatric population that documented the efficacy and the tolerability of use of high doses of sgAH,s (up to four times the standard
dose). The recent review of Ben-Shoshan and Grattan regarding the
management of pediatric urticaria’® highlighted the relevant knowledge gap related to the best management strategy in children with
more severe cases of CSU. The authors underlined the absence of
studies documenting the use of high doses of sgAH,s, the presence
of limited studies on sgAH,s response in pediatrics, and the absence
of studies reporting the percentage of children failing to respond to
standard doses. There are only two studies reporting percentage failure with high doses of sgAH,s in children: Our study is in agreement

with Doshi et al.2° showing a percentage of non-responder patients

of 13 % in a total of 54 children studied; in our study, we reported
a similar percentage of non-responder patients (18.2% in a total of
66 children). On the other hand, our results are different from those

of Neverman et al.??

who reported a higher percentage of non-responder patients (34% in a total of 46 children studied). Concerning
the response rate, another study conducted using both adults and
children over 12 years of age*? observed a responder percentage
rate of 99%. The difference between that rate and our results (66.4%
response rate) is probably due to the different score used to measure
clinical control of CSU. In fact, they used Dermatology Life Quality
Index rather than UAS7, which was employed in our study.

Regarding the tolerability of the updosing of sgAH,s, studies
suggest that in teenagers and adults the use of cetirizine may induce
somnolence and decrease motivation to perform activities during
the day??*4. A recent paper?’ proposed a critical use of guidelines
to improve our knowledge in cases of CSU. This suggestion was
founded on the basis of the high prevalence of adverse events that
were documented with the accelerated updosing to fourfold the
standard dose of sgAH,s in 7 pediatric patients who had been unresponsive to single dose of sgAH,s. The study showed a prevalence
of adverse events of 71.4%. Our results, on the other hand, showed
a lower prevalence of adverse events (13.6% in 68 children) with a
longer period of observation of the symptoms before the updosing
began (more than 2 weeks, Figure 2). It is important to highlight the
fact that the majority of our patients displayed as side effect only
mild drowsiness at high doses of sgAH,s and did not experience a
decrease in motivation to perform normal daily activities; in only
three cases, we required to stop therapy and switch to another type
of sgAH,s in order to achieve resolution of the symptoms. We are
in total agreement with the conclusion of the study of Manti et al.?°
stating that the treatment algorithm for CSU should be applied with
caution in children, but we emphasize the fact that the updosing of
sgAH,s must be performed when the symptoms not only persist but
also configure a moderate CSU condition (UAS7>15). Moreover, the
adjustment of the drug used in treatment, in our case a change from
cetirizine to rupatadine, can be useful to reduce side effects. We
also speculate that a longer period of symptoms observation (more
than 2 weeks) before the updosing would very likely be useful in the
pediatric population to minimize the side effects and also to evaluate
the clinical effect.

Our study also shows that in term of efficacy of the treatment,
exceeding double dosing in a pediatric population may not be useful.
In fact, we observed a high level of response (49/66, 74.2%) using
the standard and double dose of sgAH,s. On the other hand, we
demonstrated how most patients (12/15, 80%) who received triple
or quadruple doses required a subsequent therapeutic step with
omalizumab.

One limitation of our study was that patients did not undergo
basophil activation test (BAT), which appears to be helpful in identifying autoimmune CSU and classifying the patient in terms of prognosis. In this regard, a recent study”° has shown that autoimmune
CSU is a relatively narrow but immunologically distinct subtype of
chronic spontaneous urticaria that cannot be identified through
SARTI er AL.

 

routine clinical parameters. Therefore, the inclusion of BAT and basophil histamine release assay in the diagnostic workup of patients
with CSU could help identify patients with this autoimmune subtype, who may turn out to have a different prognosis and benefit
from specific management.

Another limitation of our study may be linked to the fact that in
some cases the progress of our patients was tracked through telephone interviews, perhaps a less than ideal way to assess patients’
tolerability to the treatment. This may have caused an underestimation of adverse reactions, also given the median age of the children included in our study. However, when important side effects
occurred, the family immediately reported these. Moreover, dealing
with parents in a real-life environment, we carried out all possible
efforts to limit the extent of subjective information, especially for
younger patients.

In conclusion, sgAH1s administered up to fourfold the standard
dose appears to be safe even in children with CSU. However, given
this fact, the efficacy of the treatment appears to be limited to double the standard dose. Concerning future perspectives in the field,
we are confident that upcoming well-designed randomized clinical
trials on larger pediatric populations will be crucial to determine the
efficacy and tolerability profiles of antihistamines when used at high
doses in the pediatric population.
