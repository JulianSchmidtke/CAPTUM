Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common skin
disease defined as spontaneous recurrent wheals and
angioedema or both lasting for at least 6 weeks (1). CSU
usually has a duration of 1—5 years, but in 14% of patients
it lasts longer (2). Omalizumab, an anti-[gE humanized
monoclonal antibody, has proven effective for the treatment of CSU and is currently recommended as the thirdline treatment option for management of CSU (1, 3).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A prospective observational study was carried out on 24 patients
with moderate, H1 antihistamine-refractory CSU, managed at our
referral centre since 2015, who received omalizumab re-treatment
after a successful first course of treatment (i.e. > 90% improvement
in symptoms) (4) with this drug. In all patients, re-treatment was
necessary because they experienced relapse of the disease with
an intensity of symptoms (urticaria activity score [UAS7] +15%)
similar to the pre-treatment period. The option of taking non-sedating second-generation H1 antihistamines (nsAH) only as needed
for symptomatic relief was investigated, rather than maintaining
a stable daily dosage of nsAHs while on omalizumab treatment.
The study comprised a 4-week pre-treatment period, a 24-week
first treatment period, an 8—16-week follow-up period, and a 24week second treatment course. Patients were recruited who had
moderate, refractory CSU, defined as having a history of spontaneous urticaria for more than 6 weeks, who had not responded to
treatment with the approved dosage of nsAH for at least 4 weeks
and who had a clinically diagnosed daily urticaria activity score
(UAS) of 4 or more and a 7-day urticaria activity score (UAS7) between 16 and 27 in the 7 days preceding the first treatment. UAS7
is a widely used patient-reported measure of CSU (1). Autologous
serum skin test (ASST) (5) and measurement of dosage of total
serum IgE were performed in all patients at baseline.
Omalizumab was administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks at
doses of 300 mg for 24 weeks (1* treatment course) and again (2"¢
treatment course) at least 8 weeks after the end of the first course
(6). Also, in the second treatment course all the patients received
omalizumab 300 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 24 weeks.
In the first cycle and between the
first and the second cycles, patients
continued to receive stable doses of

The median, range, mean and standard deviation (SD) at defined
time intervals (baseline, 12 months, 24 months) were calculated
for all 3 clinical scores (UAS7, hive and itch severity score (ISS)).
Comparisons of median scores at 12 and 24 weeks of the latter 3
clinical outcomes with their corresponding baseline values were
made using the Wilcoxon non-parametric test. The mean difference
between the 3 clinical scores at 12 and 24 weeks and their respective baseline values was calculated using the ¢-test. Comparisons of
proportions were made using the 7? test. The level of significance
was set at <0.05. Statistical analysis was performed with Stata 14
package (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).

The local ethics committee approved the study and written
informed consent was obtained from all patients (registration
number: #5202).

RESULTS

For the 24 patients (58.3% (n= 14) women and 41.7%
(n= 10) men) enrolled in the present study, the mean + standard deviation (SD) age was 48.0 + 13.7 years. The mean
time since diagnosis of CSU was 15.2+11.1 months.
ASST was positive in 37.5% of subjects. The mean IgE
level for patients was 161.2+111.0 kU/L. The mean inclinic UAS was 4.6 +0.7 and mean+SD UAS7 19.8 +0.5.
The nsAHs administered to the 24 patients were bilastine
(n=7; 29.2%), cetirizine (n=4; 16.7%), fexofenadine
(n=3; 12.5%), levocetirizine (n=2; 8.3%), rupatadine
(n=2; 8.3%) and ebastine (n=6; 25.0%).

Following the first course of treatment, all patients
experienced relapse of the disease, with a UAS 7 score
similar to the value at pretreatment, within 9-19 weeks of
the final injection of omalizumab (mean time to relapse
14.6 weeks). The mean+SD UAS7 before starting the
second treatment was 21.3 +2.7.

start of treatment with their respective baseline values
(outcome at 12 weeks vs. baseline; outcome at 24 weeks
vs. baseline) for both therapeutic regimes. Both treatments showed strong efficacy, with almost overlapping
health outcomes at 12 and 24 weeks compared with their
baseline values in terms of ISS (p<0.001), hive score
(p<0.001) and UAS7 score p<0.001).

Comparison of clinical scores between the 2 treatment
courses (24 vs. 1‘) shows that there was only weak evidence of a difference between the 2 treatments for ISS score
at 12 weeks (Wilcoxon test p-value=0.03) and slightly
higher values for the 2" course. This discrepancy, however, waned at 24 weeks. Improvements in weekly UAS7
over time were similar in the 2 treatment groups (Fig. 1).

There was some evidence of a difference between the
2 treatment courses in the proportion of patients with a
UAS7=0 (p=0.02) and itch-free days (p=0.01) at 12
weeks, with slightly better health outcomes observed for
the first treatment regimen. However, the latter differences disappeared at 24 weeks. No significant difference
was detected between the 2 treatment courses regarding
the proportions of patients with angioedema-free days
in weeks 5-24. No significant differences were found
between the 2 treatment courses in terms of number of
hydroxyzine tablets taken by patients. In contrast, there
was strong evidence (Wilcoxon p<0.001) ofa difference
in the number of nsAH tablets taken by patients in the
first treatment regimen compared with the second.

The 2 omalizumab treatments were very well tolerated.

DISCUSSION

There is currently no consensus regarding modality of
CSU treatment with omalizumab and there is a lack of
clinical trial data on concomitant H1 antihistamine therapy
during omalizumab treatment in this patient group.

In some randomized clinical trials (RCTs) patients
continued to receive stable licensed doses of their prerandomization H1-antihistamine throughout the treat

ment period with omalizumab (7, 8), or received high
doses (2-4 times the approved dose) of H1 antihistamines
(9), or maintained stable doses of their pre-randomization
combination therapy with H1 antihistamine treatment
plus H2 antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, or both (10). In other RCTs, patients were given
H1-antihistamines on an as-needed basis throughout the
treatment period (11, 12).

To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that
nsAH as needed for symptom relief during omalizumab
treatment is as effective as maintaining stable doses of
the same drug in patients with moderate refractory CSU.

Despite a relatively small sample size, this study was
still capable of detecting significant differences with relevant effect sizes. Although larger confirmatory studies are
needed, our findings suggest that it might be preferable
for patients with moderate CSU to combine a 24-week
omalizumab treatment with nsAH as needed, rather than
undertaking a daily H1 antihistamine therapy course at
the approved dosage.

Thus, it is possible that concomitant use of nsAH is
not necessary if omalizumab works. Or perhaps omalizumab would not necessarily be added to nsAH when
nsAH does not work. Such a treatment regimen would be
more advantageous, since it may have a positive impact
on quality of life and the motivation of patients, thus
potentially increasing their compliance with therapy.
Moreover, the latter treatment approach would reduce
the pharmaceutical costs, not only to the health service,
but also to patients themselves. Lastly, although being
more tolerated than first-generation counterparts, nsAH
may still cause side-effects, particularly in sensitive individuals and in case of interaction with other medications
taken by patients (13).

Furthermore, as previously reported (4, 14) in our
study omalizumab provided rapid and effective symptomatic relief in both treatment courses, with almost
overlapping health outcomes at 12 and 24 weeks.

The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.
