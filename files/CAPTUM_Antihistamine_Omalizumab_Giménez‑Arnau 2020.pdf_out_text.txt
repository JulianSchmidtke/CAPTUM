and Recent Progress

Abstract

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is characterized by the presence of wheals, angioedema, or both for at least 6 weeks.
It may persist for a long time—up to 50% of the patients have been reported to be symptomatic 5 years after the onset. Some
patients can suffer more than one episode of CSU during their lifetime. Considering the recurrences, disabling symptoms,
and significant impact on quality of life, proper and effective treatment of CSU is critical. The use of antihistamines (AHs)
is still the mainstay of treatment. However, given the low rates of response to AHs (38.6% and 63.2% to standard doses and
higher doses, respectively), the complete control of symptoms seems difficult to attain. The use of omalizumab for CSU has
been a major breakthrough in the care of patients with CSU. However, the partial response and lack of response to omalizumab in a subgroup of patients, as high as 70% in some studies, make the development of alternative treatments desirable.
Ever-increasing knowledge on the pathogenesis is making new target molecules available and enabling drug development for
CSU. In addition to drug repurposing as in anti-IL-4/13, IL-5, and IL-17 antibodies, novel targeted therapy options such as
ligelizumab and Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical trials and will be available in the near
future. This article reviews the current challenges in the treatment of CSU, the pathogenesis and potential target molecules,
and the rationale for novel treatments and their rapidly developing status.

Chronic urticaria (CU) is characterized by the presence of
wheals, angioedema, or both for at least 6 weeks and can last
for months and even years [1]. The chronic, spontaneous,
and unpredictable course of the disease is defined as chronic
spontaneous urticaria (CSU), which shows disabling symptoms and challenges in the treatment that might impair the
quality of life (QoL) of the patients. CU can also be induced
by specific physical and chemical environmental factors
(e.g., friction, pressure, cold, ultraviolet light, etc.). Inducible chronic urticarias (CIndUs) can be pure urticarias or be
manifested in combination with CSU. Studies have reported
high rates of impairment in different aspects of QoL such

report missing at least an hour at work per week in addition
to presenteeism in 25.7% of the patients [3]. The effects of
CSU on QoL were comparable to psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and even ischemic heart disease [2, 4]. The impairment
was more severe in patients with uncontrolled disease and
angioedema [2].

In the pre-omalizumab period, antihistamines (AHs)
were the only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved drug class for the treatment of CSU. The major
challenge during that period was the treatment of patients
not responding to AHs [5]. A meta-analysis showed that the
rates of response to AHs at standard doses and updosing of
AHs were 38.6% and 63.2%, respectively [6]. Another study
reported even lower response rates to standard doses, with
disease control in only 22% of the patients [7]. The low rates
of response to antihistamines might lead to frequent use of
healthcare sources and greater impairment of QoL [8]. Side
effects limit the use of other treatment alternatives including systemic corticosteroids and cyclosporine, particularly
long term [9].

Although omalizumab was already mentioned as a fourthline or experimental treatment alternative in treatment
guidelines as early as 2009 [10, 11], it was not until 2014
that the EMA and FDA approved the use of omalizumab
in CSU, which revolutionized the treatment of CSU. Since
then, the ever-growing evidence derived from clinical trials
and real-life studies suggests that omalizumab is a safe and
effective treatment for CSU [12, 13]. Despite the high rates
of complete response (up to 36% of patients in randomized
clinical trials [12]), there is no curative therapy for CSU,
and moreover a subset of patients are either unresponsive
(no response and partial response in 10% and 17.8% of the
patients in real-world studies, respectively [14]) or so-called
slow/gradual responders to omalizumab [15, 16]. Moreover,
studies have shown that CSU might persist for a long period,
with 17.3-50% of the patients being still symptomatic after
5 years despite ongoing treatment [7, 17, 18]. Considering
that CSU has a large effect on patients’ social/work life and
involves more frequent use of healthcare services, there is
still a need for new therapeutic options. As the underlying
pathophysiological mechanisms in CSU are being deciphered, there is an ongoing increase of candidate targets
and molecules. This article reviews the unmet needs in CSU
treatment, the current understanding of the pathophysiology
of CSU, and emerging therapeutic molecules.

2 Overview of Pathogenesis and Potential
Treatment Targets

Although the pathogenesis of CSU is still not fully understood, mast cells and basophils are the principal effector
cells. Degranulation of mast cells and basophils, the release
of stored mediators, and subsequently synthesized cytokines
lead to development of wheals and/or angioedema in CSU.
The immediate chemoatraction of cells from the blood carry
the dermis through the endothelia and involve an infiltrate of
lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils and polymorphonuclear
cells. This build up contributes to the full expression of the
urticaria lesions, which tend to be edematous and less itchy,
until they disappear [19, 20].

The main mechanisms underlying increased activation of
mast cells and basophils are dysregulation of intracellular
signaling pathways (e.g., activation of spleen tyrosine kinase
(SYK), low levels of Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing inositol phosphatases) [21, 22] and type I (IgE autoantibodies
to self antigens such as thyroid peroxidase, also referred to
as autoallergy) and type II/Ilb (IgG autoantibodies against
IgE or FceRI) autoimmunity [23-25]. A recently described
receptor is Mrgprb2 (murine)/MRGPRX2 (human), which
mediates the activation of mast cells in response to cationic compounds, several drugs, endogenous peptides,
and amines. MRGPRX2 induced by activated mast cells

is associated with the physiology of the mast-cell-nerve
functional unit [26]. Many other receptors, such as PAR-2,
chemokine receptors, complement receptors, endothelin1R, FeYRU for IgG, TLRs, and ST2 for IL-33, also induce
the growth and activation of mast cells, which leads to the
release of multiple mediators such as histamine, serotonin, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, platelet-activating factor,
tryptase, and cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-13, IL-5, IL-31, etc.)
[26]. Activation of coagulation pathways, increased inflammatory cytokines, and neurotransmitter-mediated mast-cell
activation are among the other proposed pathogenic mechanisms [19, 27].

A detailed review of the pathogenesis of CSU is beyond
the scope of this review, but the potential molecular targets
of emerging treatments and their primary functions are summarized in Table 1.

3 Omalizumab: From Development
to Current Challenges

Omalizumab is an anti-I[gE monoclonal antibody that was
originally developed for allergic asthma and was approved
by the FDA in 2003 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe
allergic asthma. The primary mechanisms of action of
omalizumab are binding and lowering free IgE and thus
down-regulating FceRI on mast cells and basophils [28].
Given the alterations in mast cell and basophil functions
and the presence of autoantibodies against FceRI in CSU,
omalizumab was proposed as a viable treatment option for
CSU [29]. The earliest study registered on ClinicalTrials.gov
(Identifier: NCT00130234) investigating the use of omalizumab in CSU dates back to late 2004. Two exploratory
phase II proof-of-concept studies (X-Cuisite and Mystique),
comprising 22 patients in total, have shown the efficacy and
safety of omalizumab [29, 30]. Since then, growing evidence
provided by phase III (Asteria I-II and Glacial) studies led
to approval of the use of omalizumab for CSU in adult and
adolescent patients unresponsive to AHs in 2014 by the
European Medicines Agency (EMA) and FDA. In addition to the primary mechanisms of action of omalizumab,
some possible explanations for its effectiveness in CSU have
been suggested, including reducing mast cell releasability,
reversing basopenia, and reducing IgG antibodies against
IgE/FceRI [28].

Phases II-IV clinical trials have consistently demonstrated the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in patients
with CSU unresponsive to standard or increased doses of
AHs. A summary of the data from pivotal phases II-IV trials is given in Table 2 [31-40]. Numerous real-life studies
have confirmed these findings. In fact, a recent meta-analysis of 67 real-life studies has reported complete and partial
response rates of 72.2% and 17.8%, respectively, which are

at least comparable to results from clinical trials [14]. Systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials showed
that the rate of adverse events (AEs) was not significantly
different between omalizumab and placebo [12, 13]. Accordingly, the meta-analysis of real-life studies has shown a mean
AE rate of 4% [14]. Moreover, the positive impact of omalizumab on various aspects of patient QoL has also been also
demonstrated in clinical trials and real-life studies [41-43].

Yet, there are still some obscurities and challenges
regarding the use of omalizumab for CSU. First of all,
despite the high rates of response to omalizumab, unresponsive patients still pose a major challenge in clinical practice.
Moreover, data from the literature suggest that obtaining a
complete response might take up to 6 months in patients who
are “slow responders”, unlike the “fast responders”, who
respond to treatment within 4 weeks [44, 45]. Studies investigating the factors associated with response to omalizumab
have revealed that patients with a positive basophil histamine release assay (BHRA), a positive autologous serum
skin test (ASST), lower baseline basophil FceRI expression, lower IgE levels, and a lower ratio of 4-week/baseline
IgE are more likely to show no response or a slow response
[46-52]. These findings show that the patients exhibiting the
features of autoimmune CSU with type Ib autoimmunity
(positive in vivo reactivity (ASST), positive in vitro basophil reactivity (BHRA) and presence of IgG autoantibodies against FceRI) are less likely to completely respond to
omalizumab [53, 54]. However, considering that only 8%
of the patients in the PURIST study fulfilled all three criteria, novel clinical or laboratory biomarkers of response to
omalizumab are still needed [53]. The clinical and laboratory predictors of response to omalizumab in patients with
CSU are given in Table 3.

Alternative strategies in those patients include updosing
omalizumab, switching to immunosuppressive treatment,
for example, cyclosporine or combining omalizumab with
other systemic treatments. The studies have shown that
updosing to 450 or 600 mg provides better disease control
in 32-75% of patients [55-60]. The need for updosing was
associated with older age (>57 years old), higher baseline
body mass index (BMI), lower baseline urticaria control test
(UCT) scores, lower baseline IgE levels, and immediate use
of CsA [55, 57, 58]. The major shortcoming of immunosuppressive treatments is AEs, and the combined use of
omalizumab with other systemic agents (e.g., cyclosporine,
dapsone, colchicine) is based on anecdotal reports [61-63].
Thus, all three alternative strategies require further evidence
currently.

Although omalizumab is approved and recommended by
the guidelines as an add-on therapy to AHs as third-line
treatment, up to 20% of the patients discontinue AHs and use
omalizumab as monotherapy [1, 64]. Despite some evidence
indicating that omalizumab monotherapy is as effective as

The test shown has its own limitations that should be taken into account

combined use with AHs, future studies are needed on the use
of omalizumab as monotherapy [62].

There are different approaches on how to stop treatment
in patients with complete response [65]. Treatment might be
stopped as soon as a complete response is obtained, since
re-treatment can effectively control possible relapses [37].
Another strategy is extending the dosing intervals by 1 week
up to 8 weeks and then stopping the treatment, which provided higher complete response rates in one study [66, 67].
Both approaches need to be validated in larger studies before
making strong recommendations.

Although the current data suggest that omalizumab
is effective in patients with chronic inducible urticaria
(CIndU), particulary in symptomatic dermographism, cholinergic urticaria, cold urticaria, and solar urticaria, the use
of omalizumab for CIndUs is not approved yet [68-73].

Omalizumab can be considered a safe treatment with low
AE rates comparable to placebo [12, 14]. It is also well tolerated in patients with underlying systemic co-morbidities
[74]. The data from studies in patients with asthma have
demonstrated safety with long-term use [75]. Despite the
limited number of reports in CSU [76], future studies with

4 Adis
larger sample sizes and longer durations of follow-up are
needed. Furthermore, the concurrent use of omalizumab
with other biologics did not cause any increase in infections
or laboratory abnormalities [77]. Larger studies in patients
with asthma and case series of CSU showed no increase of
major congenital abnormalities with the use of omalizumab
during pregnancy [78-80]. However, the use of omalizumab
during pregnancy is still not approved.

4 Upcoming Targeted Therapies for Chronic
Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU)

4.1 Anti-IgE

Despite the well-established effectiveness and safety of
omalizumab, the above-mentioned shortcomings of the
treatment prompted the search for an anti-IgE antibody with
greater affinity for IgE.

4.1.1 Ligelizumab

A novel monoclonal antibody directed against the Ce3
domain of IgE is ligelizumab. Preclinical and phase I studies
demonstrated that ligelizumab (QGE031) has 50-fold greater
affinity in vitro and six- to ninefold greater potency in vivo
compared to omalizumab. Ligelizumab provided greater
and longer suppression of free and cell-bound IgE and
skin-prick-test reactions than omalizumab [81]. Recently, a
mechanistic and functional comparison of ligelizumab and
omalizumab showed epitope differences that contribute to
their qualitative distinct IgE-receptor profiles. Liguelizumab
shows better suppression of IgE binding to FceRI, basophil
activation, and IgE secretion by B cells [82]. The research
also showed inhibition of IgE-FceRII (CD23) interaction
was stronger for omalizumab. Considering the role of CD23
in lung inflammation, the authors suggested that the lack of
superiority of ligelizamab compared to placebo/omalizumab
ina phase II trial (NCT01716754) conducted in patients with
allergic asthma might be explained by this difference [82]. A
phase IIb dose-finding trial compared the efficacy and safety
of ligelizumab 24 mg, 72 mg, and 240 mg every 4 weeks
with omalizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks and placebo in 382
adult patients with CSU. The percentage of patients with
complete control of hives (HSS7:0) and complete control of
symptoms (UAS7:0) at week 12 was higher in ligelizumab
arms compared to omalizumab and placebo (HSS7: 30%,
51%, 42%, 26%, and 0% and UAS7: 40%, 48%, 42%, 29%,
and 0% for ligelizumab 24 mg, 72 mg, 240 mg, omalizumab
300 mg, and placebo, respectively). Dose-dependent efficacy
of ligelizumab showing a plateau starting at 72 mg has been
demonstrated. The low complete response rates with omalizumab were attributed to the high number of patients with an

4 Adis

autoimmune component and angioedema. The rates of AEs
were similar in all groups, except for a slightly higher incidence of local reaction at the injection site for ligelizumab
240 mg compared to omalizumab [83]. Further analysis of
this study showed that among patients with an UAS7 <6 at
week 20, the response was maintained for a median of 16,
8, and 8 weeks with ligelizumab 240 mg, 72 mg, and omalizumab, respectively. Following the 1-year extension phase
(patients with UAS7 > 12 during the follow-up received ligelizumab 240 mg every 4 weeks; NCT02649218) with ligelizumab 240 mg, the UAS7 <6 response was maintained for
even longer, for a median of 28 weeks [84]. A decrease in the
use of rescue medication was also demonstrated and maintained during the extension phase in the ligelizumab group
[85]. Ligelizumab also showed greater and sustained efficacy
in controlling angioedema compared to omalizumab and placebo at week 12 (the percentage of angioedema-free patients
with ligelizumab 72 mg, 240 mg, omalizumab 300 mg, and
placebo, was 87.5%, 94.9%, 76.3%, and 68.3%, respectively).
Following retreatment with ligelizumab 240 mg during the
extension phase, 91% of the patients were angioedema-free
at week 12 [86]. Different advantages of ligelizumab versus
omalizumab observed in these phase II trials are currently
being reported. Phase III clinical trials (NCT03580356,
NCT03580369, NCT03437278, NCT04210843) investigating the efficacy and safety of ligelizumab 72 mg and 120 mg
compared to omalizumab 300 mg and/or placebo in adolescent and/or adult patients with CSU over up to 52 weeks are
ongoing. Another phase III, open-label, single-arm study
of ligelizumab in adult Japanese patients with CSU unresponsive to H1-AHs is also in progress (NCT03907878).
The extension phase study with liguelizumab will help to
characterize its use in re-treatment, self-administration, and
monotherapy, helping us to predict better use in real life.

4.1.2 UB-221

UB-221, another monoclonal antibody against IgE, has up
to eightfold greater affinity for free IgE in comparison to
omalizumab. It is currently being investigated in an ongoing phase I trial for safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics,
and pharmacokinetics following a single dose [0.2, 0.6, 2, 6,
10 mg/kg UB-221 intravenously (IV) vs. placebo] in adult
patients with CSU (NCT03632291, NCT04175704).

4.1.3 Quilizumab

Quilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed
against membrane-bound IgE, was also evaluated for the
treatment of CSU in a phase II trial. Following a 20-week
treatment with quilizumab 450 mg or placebo every 4 weeks,
no statistically significant differences were observed in ISS7,
HSS7, and UAS7 scores between two groups. The changes in
Targeted Therapy for Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria

scores in the quilizumab group also failed to reach the minimally important difference (MID) range [87]. The further
development of quilizimab for CSU has been discontinued.

The data from clinical trials with novel monoclonal IgE
antibodies with greater potency compared to omalizumab
seem very promising [83].

4.2 Anti-Siglec-8

Siglecs are a family of transmembrane proteins that have
regulatory effects on intercellular and intracellular signaling such as inhibition of cellular proliferation/activation and
inducing apoptosis [88, 89]. Of them, Siglec-8 is specifically
expressed on eosinophils and mast cells. Studies showed
that activation of Siglec-8 induces apoptosis in eosinophils
and inhibits FceRI-mediated histamine and PGD2 release
from mast cells [90, 91]. In a phase I, randomized, placebocontrolled study conducted in 51 healthy subjects, a single dose of AK002 (0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and
1 mg/kg IV), a monoclonal anti-Siglec-8 antibody, resulted
in complete depletion of circulating eosinophils within an
hour. The effect was maintained up to 84 days in the group
who received 1 mg/kg, suggesting that AK002 might be suitable to be administrated in monthly or quarterly intervals
[92]. Moreover, treatment with AKO002 (antolimab) provided
symptomatic and histologic improvement in patients with
eosinophilic eosophagitis [93]. Given the role of eosinophils
and mast cells in CSU, the efficacy and safety of AKO02 in
CSU has also been investigated. In a phase Ila study, adult
patients with CSU and CIndU (cholinergic urticaria and
symptomatic dermographism) received six doses of AKO02
(0.3, 1, 1, 1-3, 1-3, 1-3 mg/kg, IV infusion). At week 22,
among the patients with CSU, the response rates based on
changes in UCT score [complete + partial (complete)] were
92% (92%) and 86% (57%) in omalizumab-naive (n= 14)
and omalizumab-reftactory (n= 12) patients, respectively.
The response was sustained in a 12-month open-label extension phase. Other than mild-to-moderate infusion-related
reactions, no AEs were seen [94, 95]. These results indicate
that anti-Siglec-8 antibodies might be an applicable treatment alternative for CSU refractory to omalizumab in the
future.

4.3 Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) Inhibitors

Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a tyrosine kinase expressed
in various hematopoietic cells including macrophages, mast
cells, and basophils. In addition to playing a major role in
B-cell development and functions, BTK is also a part of
the FceR activation and signaling in mast cells [96, 97].
BTK inhibitors are used to treat different malignancies of
B-cell origin [98]. Four different BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib, dasatinib, AVL-292, CNX-774) effectively suppressed

Ig-E-induced activation and histamine release from basophils and mast cells, ibrutinib being the most potent [99]. In
a recent study, six patients with a known history of peanut/
tree nut allergy were treated with ibrutinib (420 mg/day) for
seven consecutive days. Skin-prick tests and basophil activation tests were performed before, during, and after treatment
course and it was shown that the significant suppression of
test responses was evident at the second day and maintained
throughout the treatment. No serious AEs were observed
[100]. Considering the critical role of FceRI signaling in
CSU, the use of BTK inhibitors for CSU shows potential.
The efficacy and safety of a more selective and covalent
BTK inhibitor, LOU064 (remibrutinib), in adult patients
with CSU is being investigated in ongoing phase II clinical trials (NCT03926611, NCT04109313). A phase II study
investigating the use of fenebrutinib (200 mg orally twice a
day) in 31 adult patients with CSU has been recently completed. The results are not published yet (NCT03693625),
but have been presented at the EAACI 2020 meeting, showing at week 8 a marked improvement of the UAS7 at 200 mg
twice a day (— 21.8+ 14.8) compared with the placebo group
(— 11.3+10.8) [60]. Unlike fenebrutinib, remibrunitib binds
BTK with a covalent bond, thus it has a faster onset of action
and its effects are maintained longer [101] (Fig. 1).

4.4 Chemoattractant Receptor-Homologous
Molecule Expressed on Th2 (CRTH2) Inhibitors

Upon its release from activated mast cells, prostaglandin
D2 (PGD2) exerts its effects through two receptors: D
prostanoid receptor (DP) and chemoattractant receptorhomologos molecule expressed on Th2 (CRTH2). CRTH2
is normally expressed on eosinophils, basophils, and Th2
cells. The PGD2-mediated activation of CRTH2 results in
stimulation and chemotaxis of basophils and eosinophils,
Th2 response, and augmentation of histamine release from
basophils [102, 103]. One study has demonstrated low levels
of surface CRTH2 on basophils and eosinophils of patients
with CSU, which was attributed to internalization of CRTH2
following PGD2 binding. These results suggest a role for
PGD2 via CRTH2 in CSU [102]. In another study, the
CRTH2 expression on eosinophils was increased in patients
with atopic dermatitis, prurigo nodularis, and CSU. Moreover, the expression levels in AD were correlated with disease
severity [104]. In an earlier study, a particular CRTH2 gene
polymorphism was associated with an increase in required
dose of AHs to control CSU [105]. Based on these findings,
an oral CRTH2 antagonist, AZD1981, was used for the treatment of CSU in a phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial. Twenty-six subjects completed the 4-week treatment
period with either AZD1981 (40 mg three times daily) or
placebo. UAS7 and ISS7 scores significantly decreased
compared to baseline in the treatment group, although the

primary endpoint (decrease in UAS7> 9.5) was not met. No
significant differences were observed in terms of AH use,
DLQI score, or angioedema frequency between two groups.
Moreover, treatment with AZD1981 significantly inhibited
PGD2-mediated eosinophil shape change and migration to
the skin. The treatment was well tolerated without any serious AEs [103]. Despite failing to meet the primary endpoint,
considering the significant effect on itch severity and cellular
level, future studies evaluating the efficacy of AZD1981 with
longer duration and higher doses are warranted.

4.5 Spleen Tyrosine Kinase (SYK) Inhibitors
Following the activation of FceRI in mast cells, spleen

tyrosine kinase (SYK) plays a major role by regulating histamine release and synthesis of the mediators (cytokines,

necrosis factor-a, TSLP thymic stromal lymphopoietin

leukotriene, prostoglandin) [106]. Given the crucial role
of SYK in adaptive immunity, oral SYK inhibitors such as
fostamatinib are used for immune thrombocytopenic purpura and chronic graft-versus-host disease. An intranasal
SYK inhibitor, R112, was shown to suppress FceRI-related
mediator-releasing pathways in mast cells [107]. Based on
these data suggesting a central role for SYK in mast cell
degranulation and CSU, the use of SYK inhibitors for the
treatment of CSU might be plausible. Accordingly, the use
of a topical SYK inhibitor, GSK2646264, blocked the histamine release from mast cells through IgE signaling in an
ex vivo human skin model [108]. In another study, when
the patients with CSU were categorized according to the
degree of histamine release from basophils as responders
and non-responders, the expression of SYK protein was
found to be significantly elevated in responders compared to
Targeted Therapy for Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria

non-responders and healthy controls. The increased expression of SYK was also correlated with spontaneous histamine
release from mast cells [109]. The efficacy and safety of
GSK2646264 0.5% and 1% topical cream in patients with
CSU and cold urticaria have been evaluated in a randomized,
placebo-controlled phase I trial (NCT02424799) of which
the results are not available yet.

4.6 Anti-CD20

Rituximab (RTX) is a monoclonal antibody directed against
CD20. Through the depletion of memory B cells, it has been
used to treat hematological malignancies, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and pemphigus vulgaris [110]. It is thought that
the reduction of memory B cells and subsequent decrease of
the autoantiboides might be of benefit particularly in autoimmune CSU. In the literature, at least five patients with
CSU have been treated with rituximab to date [111-115].
The patients had severe CSU refractory to immunosuppressive treatments. All except for one patient responded well
to RTX, which was used either as in lymphoma (375 mg/
m? weekly for 4 weeks) or as an RA protocol (two doses
of 1000 mg with a 2-week interval). However, apart from
a phase I/I open-label trial (NCT00216762) that was terminated due to safety concerns, there is no ongoing clinical trial of RTX for CSU. Despite the need for randomized,
controlled studies and the caution regarding AEs [116],
RTX could be reserved as an alternative in patients with
very severe, treatment-resistant CSU.

4.7 Anti-IL-1

Among the members of IL-1 cytokine family, IL-la and
IL-18 have pro-inflammatory effects, whereas the IL-1R
antagonist shows anti-inflammatory properties [117].
Mutations in the NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domaincontaining protein 3) gene result in NLRP3 inflammasome
activation, followed by activation of caspase-1, increased
secretion of IL-1, and systemic inflammation. This is
associated with a heterogeneous syndrome referred to as
NLRP3-associated autoinflammatory disease [NLRP3-AID
(consisting of familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome,
Muckle—Wells syndrome, chronic infantile neurological,
cutaneous and articular syndrome)] in which an urticarial rash is a common symptom [118, 119]. Canakinumab
(monoclonal antibody against of IL-1), anakinra (recombinant IL-1R antagonist), and rilonacept (IL-1a/B blocker)
are effectively used in the treatment of autoinflammatory
syndromes [120]. IL-1-blocking agents were also effective in
treating urticarial vasculitis and Schnitzler syndrome, which
are also characterized by the presence of urticarial rash and
systemic inflammation [121, 122]. Another patient with
idiopathic cold urticaria responded well to treatment with

anakinra [123]. Recently, somatic mutations in NLRP3 were
shown in two elderly patients with long-standing, refractory chronic urticaria associated with fever and increased
CRP. Both the patients significantly improved with anakinra.
The authors concluded that an underlying NLRP3-related
disorder and anti-IL-1 treatment should be considered in
patients with refractory urticaria and systemic inflammation markers [124]. The effectiveness of RPH-104 (a novel
molecule against IL-1), rilonacept, and canakinumab have
been investigated in Schnitzler syndrome (NCT04213274),
acquired cold-contact urticaria (NCT02171416), and CSU
(NCT01635127), respectively. The results of these trials are
not available yet.

4.8 Anti-IL-4/13

Interleukin-4 and IL-13 both play a role in Th2 differantiation and induction of B cells to plasma cells [117, 125].
Dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the
alpha subunit of IL-4 and IL-13 receptors. It is approved
in the treatment of asthma, nasal polyposis, and atopic dermatitis [125]. Increased levels of IL-4 and a mixed Th1/
Th?2 response have been previously demonstrated in patients
with chronic urticaria, thus making dupilumab a viable treatment alternative for CSU [126]. Accordingly, in a recent
case series, six patients with concomitant atopic dermatitis
and CSU refractory to omalizumab 600 mg were treated
with dupilumab successfully. The authors concluded that
the effect might be a result of blocking B-cell differentiation
to plasma cells and inflammatory pathways causing pruritus
through the inhibition of IL-4 and IL-13, respectively [127].
Currently, there are three ongoing, still recruiting, phase II/
III studies investigating the efficacy and safety of dupilumab
in CSU (NCT03749135, NCT04180488 (EFC16461CUPID)) and cholinergic urticaria (NCT03749148) unresponsive to H1-AHs and/or omalizumab.

4.9 Anti-IL-5

Interleukin-5 plays a major role in eosinophil development and also increases their chemotactic acvitivity [117].
An increased number of eosinophils has been reported in
urticarial lesions and they are thought to play a role in the
pathogenesis of CSU through interactions with mast cells
and activation of the coagulation cascade [128]. A number of monoclonal antibodies approved for eosinophilic
asthma target the IL-5 (reslizumab, mepolizumab) or its
receptor, IL-5R (benralizumab). To our knowledge, the literature has reported three patients with urticaria who have
been treated with these drugs. Reslizumab and mepolizumab provided significant improvement of symptoms in
two patients with CSU [129, 130], whereas a patient with
symptomatic dermographism (SD) benefited from treatment

4 Adis
with benralizumab [131]. In a recent single-blind, repeatedmeasures study, 12 adult patients with CSU6 were treated
with benralizumab (30 mg subcutaneously) every 4 weeks
for 12 weeks following a single dose of placebo. Among the
nine patients who completed the study, five had complete
response. UAS7 and CU-Q2oL scores improved significantly
with benralizumab compared to placebo [132]. Gene-expression analysis in patients with CSU following benralizuamb
treatment demonstrated normalization of SIGLEC-8 expression and IL-4/5 induced inflammation [133]. Although the
results imply a role of eosinophils in CSU, the exact mechanism of action has not been understood yet. There are two
clinical trials, for which the results are not available yet,
investigating the efficacy of benralizumab (NCT03183024)
and mepolizumab (NCT03494881, recruiting is active) in
CSU. For benralizumab, a phase Ib study (ARROYO TrialD3259C00001) is about to start.

4.9.1 Anti-IL-17

Previous studies have shown an increased expression of Th2
cytokines and CD4+T cells in CSU lesions [134]. Another
study demonstrated increased blood levels of IL-17 and a
positive correlation between IL-17 levels and disease severity, suggesting a possible role of IL-17 in the pathogenesis
of CSU [135]. The results of a recent study have revealed an
increase in mast cells and CD4+T cells with strong expression of IL-17 in patients with CSU compared to healthy
controls. In the same study, eight patients with CSU recalcitrant to standard therapies were treated with secukinumab,
an IL-17A monoclonal antibody. All the patients responded
well to treatment, with the mean UAS7 scores decreased by
55% and 82% at 30 and 90 days, respectively. No AEs were
observed [136].

4.9.2. Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-a Inhibitors

Tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) plays a major role in the
initiation of inflammatory responses [117]. Mast cells contain and release TNF-a among the other mediators upon
activation, leading to development of inflammatory infiltration in CSU [137]. Furthermore, the serum levels of TNF-a
in CSU are significantly higher than the healthy controls
and are positively correlated with the severity of CSU [135,
138]. Based on these findings, the use of TNF-o inhibitors
for CSU has been evaluated in three case series [139-141].
In the first series, three patients with CSU were successfully treated with etanercept (n=2) and infliximab (n= 1)
with a long duration of remission up to 3 years [139]. In
another series of 18 patients with CSU, treatment with
adalimumab (n= 14) or etanercept (n=4) led to complete
response in 12 patients and partial response in three. Of
note, five patients had upper respiratory infections, while

4 Adis

A. M. Giménez-Arnau, A. Salman

one patient experienced central nervous system toxicity with
adalimumab, which resolved gradually following discontinuation of the treatment. In this series, treatment discontinuation resulted in relapse within a few weeks [140]. The most
recent series included nine patients with CSU. Treatment
with adalimumab for 16 weeks provided complete remission
in three patients and partial remission in four. No significant
change in the serum TNF-a levels could be demonstrated
[141]. Despite the promising findings in these series, there
is no randomized, controlled clinical trial investigating the
use of TNF-a inhibitors for CSU. One study comparing
etanercept with placebo was subsequently withdrawn with
no available results (NCT01030120). Despite the limited
evidence for all TNF-« inhibitors in treatment of CSU, the
use of adalimumab could be suggested as a potentially useful tool for controlling CSU recalcitrant to omalizumab and
immunosuppressive treatments.

4.9.3 Other Possible Targets for Treatment

Some other molecules participating in the pathogenesis of
CSU also need to be mentioned as they might be important
targets for treatment in the upcoming years.

In patients with CSU, C5a has been shown to enhance
histamine release from mast cells upon activation of FceRI
through IgG autoantibodies [142]. Moreover, activation with
CSa led to an increased basophil response in patients with
chronic urticaria compared to healthy controls [143]. These
finding indicate a possible role for CSa in CSU and provide
a basis for the evaluation of CSa inhibitors (IFX-1, eculizumab) in the treatment of CSU [144, 145].

Some inhibitory molecules such as SHIP and CD200R
also deserve further attention. SHIP-negative mast cells are
more likely to degranulate following IgE binding [146]. The
inhibitory effects of SHIP-1 occur through the hydrolysis
of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and limiting the
entry of extracellular calcium, thereby decreasing phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-mediated mast cell activation [22,
146, 147]. CD200R is expressed on mast cells and the use of
agonist antibodies directed to CD200R inhibited IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation and cytokine secretion in mice
[148]. Considering their regulatory functions on mast cells,
the use of SHIP, CD200R antibodies, or PI3K inhibitors for
CSU might be of interest.

Histamine H4 receptors are expressed by hematopoietic
cells including eosinophils, mast cells, neutrophils, and T cells.
Activation of H4 receptors results in chemotaxis, cytokine
production, immunomodulation, and inflammatory cell trafficking [149]. The use of H4R-antagonists (JNJ-7777 120) has
been associated with reduction of histamine-mediated scratching and Th2-induced inflammation in dermatitis [150, 151].
Another H4 receptor antagonist, ZPL-3893787, led to greater
improvement of inflammatory skin lesions in patients with
Targeted Therapy for Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria

atopic dermatitis compared to placebo [152]. The anti-inflammatory and anti-pruritic effects of H4R antagonists might be
of benefit in CSU treatment.

IL-31 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine mainly secreted by
Th? cells that exerts its effects through two receptors: IL-31
receptor A (IL-31RA) and oncostatin M receptor (OSMR)
[117, 153]. IL-31 was shown to induce pruritus in mice, and
furthermore, IL-31 levels were significantly higher in patients
with CSU compared to healthy subjects, although another
study reported normal levels of IL-31 [154-156]. Increased
expression of OSMR protein and histamine release were also
shown in chronic autoimmune urticaria. In addition, O9MR
gene silencing in mice led to a decrease in inflammatory
cytokines and number of eosinophils [157]. These data indicate that IL-31 or OSMR6 inhibitors (e.g., nemolizumab, vixarelimab) might play a role in the treatment of CSU.

Increased levels of IL-6, another pro-inflammatory
cytokine, have been demonstrated in patients with CSU. It
was also correlated with disease severity, suggesting the role
of systemic inflammation in CSU [158]. Tocilizumab, an
IL-6 monoclonal antibody, led to improvement in patients
with Schnitzler syndrome, and might be of potential benefit
for CSU treatment [159].

The increased expression of Mas-related gene X2
(MrgX2, MRGPRX2), which is a receptor for histaminereleasing neuropeptides including substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptides, was demonstrated in mast cells
of patients with CSU, thus making MRGPRX2 a possible
therapeutic target [160]. The antagonists for neurokinin
receptor-1 (e.g., aprepitant, tradipitant), which is the main
cutaneous receptor for substance P, are under investigation
for atopic dermatitis for their antipruritic effects and they
might be of value for CSU as well [161].

The expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP),
a promotor of Th2 response, was shown to be increased in
patients with CSU, thus making the anti-TSLP monoclonal
antibody, tezepelumab, a potential treatment alternative for
CSU [134, 162].

Calcium-release-activated calcium modulator 1 (ORAI1)
is a subunit of calcium-release-activated calcium channels,
which mediate calcium influx and mast cell degranulation
[163]. A study has demonstrated that different single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ORAII gene are associated with
an increased risk of CSU and better response to desloratadine [164]. Thus, targeting of ORAI1 via silencing RNAs
might be of therapeutic potential in CSU [163].

5 Conclusion

The future treatment of chronic urticaria will probably
change once potential new treatments are completely developed. Omalizumab has been a milestone for the current

treatment of CSU. As a result of better understanding of the
pathogenesis of CSU, the treatment armamentarium for urticaria is likely to expand in the near future. Each of the drugs
in development would probably offer therapeutic advantages
in terms of efficacy in different chronic urticaria phenotypes.
At the same time the different pharmacology chracteristics
will show advantages, for example, faster action, complete
and permanent control, route of administration, or safety.
Thus we can speculate that for the future complementary,
efficient, and safe treatments will be available for chronic
urticaria. With the advances in pathogenesis and development of new therapeutic molecules, we might be able to aim
to cure CSU instead of only obtaining full symptom control.
