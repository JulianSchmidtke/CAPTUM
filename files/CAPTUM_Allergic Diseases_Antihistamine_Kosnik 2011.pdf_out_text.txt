KEYWORDS Summary

Antileukotrienes; Background: Antihistamines (AH) alleviate pruritus and decrease the incidence of hives

Chronic urticaria; in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CU). However, some patients do not respond

Urticaria Activity completely to this therapy. We hypothesized that some of them might benefit from the
Score addition of leukotriene receptor antagonists (LA).

Methods: We screened patients diagnosed and treated for CU and selected those that had
symptoms despite antihistamine treatment. In a double-blind crossover study, patients
took the leukotriene antagonist montelukast (10mg per day) or placebo. Efficacy was
assessed by a symptom score.

Results: In a group of 22 patients, the symptom score was not significantly different
between periods using montelukast (48.8; 0-214) or placebo (68.5; 0-230). However in
the subgroup of five patients with the most severe urticaria, defined as patients with
symptom scores in the upper quartile at inclusion in the study, montelukast (41; 11-214)
was superior to placebo (95.5; 48-230; p<0.05), but only when using an in-house symptom
score questionnaire and not when using a validated urticaria activity score questionnaire.
Conclusions: We showed that in patients with antihistamine-resistant CU the addition
of montelukast significantly diminished symptoms in only a small minority of patients.
However, response to add-on montelukast was seen in the subgroup of patients with
particularly severe disease. To confirm this observation, a study with a larger group of
patients is warranted.

Introduction the pathogenesis of CU. Leukotrienes are released from
mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils. Their production
has been confirmed in CU patients, particularly in patients
with concomitant angioedema.®” Intracutaneous injection
of LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 results in wheal formation.®

There are some reports in the literature indicating the
role of antileukotrienes in CU treatment; however, few
results have been obtained from randomized studies of
patients with severe CU.?'' This study used a randomized
controlled study to evaluate the role of the antileukotriene
drug montelukast in CU patients that were symptomatic
despite treatment with antihistamines. It was presumed that
the addition of antileukotrienes to antihistamines would
diminish CU symptoms.

Chronic urticaria (CU) is characterized by itchy wheals
occurring daily for at least 6 weeks. Wheals result from
local vasodilatation and increased permeability of small
vessels. In skin biopsies of CU, eosinophils, neutrophils,
T lymphocytes, and mast cells are found as well as
immune deposits that activate complement.' Histamine is
the most important mediator responsible for skin lesions
and antihistamines are the mainstay of therapy for CU.25
However, because antihistamines are only partially effective
in inhibiting wheal formation in some CU patients, it is
very probable that other mediators apart from histamine
play a role in wheal formation in CU. There is only scant
information on the role of sulphidoleukotrienes (sLTs) in

exclusion of patients with physical urticaria, drug-induced

urticaria, and urticarial vascul

itis, we invited 98 patients

to participate. Only 24 patients fulfilled the inclusion

criteria for the double-blind

study: ongoing symptoms

(wheals, angioedema, pruritus, and sleep disturbance due

to pruritus) that were not al
no chronic therapy with s'
immunosuppressives, and no ot!
intake. At the inclusion visit,

leviated by antihistamines,
ystemic glucocorticoids or
her chronic diseases and drug
patients were asked about

itching and sleep disturbances in the previous 3 weeks

and symptoms assessed on a

scale from 0 (absent) to 10

(intolerable). The extent of the disease was assessed by

counting the number of whea

 

s (0 = no wheals, 1 = up to

5 small (< 2cm) wheals, 3 = up to 20 small wheals, 5 = 20
to 50 small or up to 5 large (> 2cm) wheals, 7 = 20 to 50
small or up to 20 large wheals, 9 = more than 50 small or up
to 30 large wheals, 10 = more than 30 large wheals. In the
presence of lip angioedema, the score was 10).

In a crossover double-blind design, patients received
montelukast (Singulair® 10mg, MSD) or matching placebo
for 14 days in addition to their ongoing antihistamine
treatment. In between there was a 7-day wash-out period,
when patients received single-blind placebo. Patients filled
out a diary card. They scored symptoms (itching and sleep
disturbance) and number of wheals daily as described
above. Patients also reported on additional therapy such
as increasing the dose of antihistamines or systemic
glucocorticoid and days with/without symptoms.

Because a validated urticaria activity score (UAS) scoring
system for assessing CU activity was published after
completion of our study, we retrospectively transformed the
data from patients’ diaries into a validated scoring system
and compared the outcomes using both scoring systems.
The UAS scores the extent of wheals (0 = none, 1 = fewer
than 20 wheals/24 hr, 2 = 20 to 50 wheals/24 hr, 3 = more
than 50 wheals/24 hr or large confluent areas of wheals)
and the influence of symptoms on patients’ daily activities
and sleep (0 = none, 1 = present but not annoying or
troublesome, 2 = troublesome but does not interfere with
normal daily activity or sleep, 3 = severe pruritus, which
is sufficiently troublesome to interfere with normal daily
activity or sleep)."

The study was supported by the Slovenian Ministry of
Education, Science, and Sport (no. J3-3468) and approved
by the national ethics committee.

Statistical methods

Differences between treatments were tested with Wilcoxon’s
signed rank test using Statistica statistical software (Stat
Soft Inc. 1995, USA). The differences between groups were
considered significant at p< 0.05.

Results

Twenty-four patients (16 female, age 45+13 years, 38%
atopics) were included. All of the patients reported hives
in the previous 3 weeks before beginning the study. Sixteen
(67%) patients also reported occurrence of angioedema. Six
(25%) patients reported intolerance to aspirin. In addition
to antihistamines (loratadine, cetirizine, or fexofendine),
four patients were taking montelukast, five patients were

on short courses of glucocorticoids, and two patients were
using indifferent ointments.

The median severity of symptoms at inclusion was 6.75
(the maximum possible score was 30; Table 1). Nineteen
(79%) of patients reported that symptoms were disturbing.

Data from the patients’ diaries were analyzed for the
22 patients that completed the double-blind montelukast
treatment. Two patients were excluded due to noncompliance. We found no significant difference in the total
symptom and medication score between periods of receiving
montelukast and placebo (Table 1). There was no difference
even in patients with a history of aspirin intolerance (data
not shown). However, using an in-house scoring system
montelukast was shown to be superior to placebo in a
subgroup of five patients with the highest symptom score
at inclusion in the study; namely, in patients with a
symptom score in the upper quartile at inclusion in the
study. Their average symptom score was 83.5 (34-216)
during placebo and 31 (3-200) during montelukast treatment
(p<0.05) and average total score 95.5 (48-230) during
placebo and 41 (11-214) during montelukast treatment
(p<0.05). The superiority of montelukast over placebo in
most symptomatic patients was not detected by the UAS.

Seven patients reported at least a 30% reduction in their
total scores while taking montelukast. According to the
literature, a 30% improvement is clinically significant.'4 This
group of seven patients included all five patients from the
group with the most severe urticaria at inclusion in the
study. On the other hand, four (18%) patients reported at
least 30% fewer symptoms while receiving placebo.

 

Discussion

In a group of patients with long-lasting CU that was not
completely controlled by nonsedating antihistamines, the
addition of montelukast did not significantly diminish the
symptoms. However, there was a Statistically significant
effect in the subgroup of most symptomatic patients.

For the majority of CU patients, oral antihistamines are
an effective treatment; however, many need higher-thanstandard doses. In a recent study only 13 out of 80 patients
referred to tertiary clinics were stabilized with standard
doses of antihistamines, and an additional 28 out of 80 were
symptom-free after increasing the dose of antihistamines
up to four times. More than half of patients thus remained
symptomatic despite antihistamines. '>

Because sLTs are released in CU it is very probable
that they contribute to symptoms; obviously, sLT-induced
symptoms cannot be alleviated by traditional antihistamine
therapy. Some case reports and studies of treatment of CU
with antileukotrienes can be found in the literature, showing
various results. Monotherapy with leukotriene synthesis
inhibitors or sLT-receptor antagonists was not effective at
all or was of marginal effectiveness in unselected patients
with mild to moderate CU.'®'7 In a study by Reimers, a
pronounced placebo response was demonstrated with 19
out of 46 patients reporting a marked response, which was
equally likely in the placebo and montelukast groups. '°

Montelukast was shown to have some effect in a
study performed by Di Lorenzo comparing desloratadine,
montelukast, these two in combination, and placebo. That
study reported a dropout rate of 68% in the montelukast

group compared to 0% in the desloratadine group,
showing antihistamines to be superior to antileukotrienes. '®
However, the dropout in the placebo arm was 100%, arguing
in favor of some therapeutic effect of montelukast. In 120
newly diagnosed patients with CU, Wan showed a similar
response rate in loratadine therapy and in loratadine plus
montelukast therapy. '?

On the other hand, two placebo-controlled studies showed
a pronounced response to montelukast, particularly in
aspirin-intolerant CU patients. '°7°

Some studies have shown that the addition of antileukotriene to antihistamine therapy slightly but significantly improves CU symptoms.?' In two open studies, the
addition of montelukast dramatically improved symptoms in
patients not responding to antihistamines alone. In a study
by Goel, all patients responded.?? In a study by Sanada,
the response rate was around 50%.23 However, open studies
should be evaluated very carefully because the placebo
effect in CU is enormous.*45

Using our scoring system, we showed a very consistent

response to montelukast in the subgroup of patients with
the most severe disease. On the other hand, 18% of
patients reported substantial improvement during placebo
treatment. To confirm that the response to montelukast
was due to its pharmacologic effect and was not solely a
placebo response, both subgroups of pronounced responders
should undergo at least one more crossover phase to test
or repeatability of the response, the treatment should be
prolonged, or the number of patients should be increased.
This study showed that the results are crucially dependent
on the method of evaluating urticaria activity. Namely,
when using the validated UAS,"? the effect of montelukast
on symptoms was not detected. The UAS appears to
be less discriminative because the UAS score is equally
influenced by the number of wheals (signs) and itching and
sleep disturbances (symptoms). We believe that symptoms
are far more important for a patient than the extent
of efflorescences, particularly when pruritus is more
effectively relieved by medicines than efflorescences. This
is why we used a scoring system in which the symptom
score was predominantly dependent on symptoms and only
partially on the extent of skin efflorescences.
Our study differed from the majority of previously
published studies because we included only patients with
ong-lasting disease with poor response to antihistamine
therapy. When screening the patients diagnosed with CU
or up to 2 years before the beginning of the study, we
ound that 75% of patients were either in remission or
were well controlled by antihistamines, which is expected
according to studies of the natural course of CU.%° In
contrast to our study, the majority of other studies included
patients with newly diagnosed CU; thus, mostly patients
with antihistamine-responsive disease. The predominance of
antihistamine-responsive CU patients in such studies might
skew the results and explain why most studies show the
relative inefficacy of add-on antileukotrienes.

In addition to the relatively small number of patients,
another limitation of our study is that we did not increase
the dose of antihistamine before declaring CU antihistamine
resistant. It has been shown that one-third of patients
that are symptomatic while taking a conventional dose of
antihistamines respond to up to four times the increase in
antihistamine dose. "4

 

 

In conclusion, we showed that for patients with
antihistamine-resistant CU montelukast significantly diminished symptoms in only a small minority of patients.
However, response to add-on montelukast was seen in
the subgroup of patients with particularly severe disease.
Patients with a large area of affected skin, extreme pruritus,
and sleep disturbances despite antihistamine therapy might
benefit from the addition of montelukast. However, to
confirm this observation, a study with a larger group of
patients is warranted.
