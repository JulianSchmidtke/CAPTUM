Abstract Human basophils have been implicated
in the pathogenesis of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), and substance P (SP) is a possible
candidate as histamine-releasing factor in some
patients with CSU. However, little is known of
relationship between basophils and SP in CSU.
In the present study, we investigated expression
of SP and NKIR on basophils from patients with
CSU, and influence of SP on basophil functions
by using flow cytometry analysis, basophil challenge, and mouse sensitization model techniques.
The results showed that plasma SP level and basophil numbers in CSU patients were higher than
that in HC subject. The percentages of SP+ and
NKIR+ basophils were markedly elevated in CSU
blood in comparison with HC blood. Once added,
SP induced up to 41.2 % net histamine release
from basophils of CSU patients, which was comparable with that provoked by anti-IgE, and fMLP.
It appeared that SP induced dramatic increase in
blood basophil numbers of mice following peritoneal injection. Ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mice

had much more SP+ and NKIR+ basophils in
blood than non-sensitized mice. In conclusion, the
elevated plasma concentration of SP, upregulated
expression of SP and NKIR on basophils, and the
ability of SP in induction of basophil degranulation and accumulation indicate strongly that SP is
most likely a potent proinflammatory mediator,
which contributes greatly to the pathogenesis of
CSU through basophils. Inhibitors of SP and
blockers of NKIR are likely useful agents for
treatment of CSU.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) has no discernable
external cause and comprises the majority of cases of
chronic urticaria (Fraser and Robertson 2013). It is
recognized to have an autoimmune cause including
production of IgE autoantibodies against autoantigens,

which might chronically activate cutaneous mast cells
and blood basophils (Chang et al. 2015). However, the
exact physiopathology of CSU remains unknown
(Ferrer 2015).

SP, a neuropeptide belonging to the tachykinin family, is a pleiotropic peptide with specific neural activities
and involved in immunomodulation (Sun and Bhatia
2014). It is ubiquitous in human body produced by
lymphocytes, macrophages (Weinstock 2015), eosinophils, and dendritic cells (O’Connor et al. 2004) and has
been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammation
(Munoz and Covenas 2014). It was reported that SP is
a possible candidate as histamine-releasing factor in
some patients with chronic ordinary urticaria, particularly in those with evidence of a non-autoantibody circulating histamine-releasing factor (Tedeschi et al.
2005). It can also act as a potent chemoattractant for
human basophils via neurokinin (NK)-1 receptor
(NK1R)-dependent mechanism in vitro (Cima et al.
2010).

NKIR is a receptor of SP found in the nervous
system and in peripheral tissues (Garcia-Recio an
Gascon 2015), and SP/NK-1 receptor complex has been
recognized as an integral part of the microenvironment
of inflammation and involved in the molecular bases o
many human pathologies (Rosso et al. 2012).
Involvement of NKIR was observed in intestinal
fibrogenesis after chronic colitis (Koon et al. 2010),
and activation of NK1R can enhance T cell IFN-y and
IL-17 production and consequently amplify the proinflammatory response (Weinstock 2015).

Since human basophils can infiltrate different skin
lesions and have been implicated in the pathogenesis o:
CSU (Borriello et al. 2014), and blood basophils o
patients with CSU display increased surface expression
of high affinity IgE receptor FceRI (Lourenco et al.
2008), this cell type is likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of CSU. Therefore, the aim of the study is to
investigate expression of SP and NKIR on basophils
from patients with CSU and influence of SP on basophil
functions.

was collected in the outpatient clinic. From each individual, 20 ml of peripheral blood was taken into an
EDTA containing tube.

Animals

BALB/c male mice (18-22 g) were obtained from Vital
River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. Ltd. (Beijing,
China), Certificate No. 11400700056942/
11400700056944/11400700056945/11400700056947.
The animals were bred and reared under strict ethical
conditions according to international recommendations.
They were housed in the Animal Experimental Center
of the First Affiliated Hospital of Jinzhou Medical
University in a specific pathogen-free environment with
free access to standard rodent chow and water at a
constant temperature 23-28 °C and relative humidity
of 60-75 %. The animal experiment procedures were
approved by the Animal Care Committee at Jinzhou
Medical University.

Flow cytometric analysis of NK1R and SP expression
in peripheral blood basophils

To detect NKIR and SP expression in human
basophilic granulocytes (CD123+HLA-DRCCR3 + cells), the following antibodies were added
to testing tube PE-conjugated mouse anti-human
CD123, PerCP-conjugated mouse anti-human

HLA-DR, and BV421-conjugated mouse antihuman CCR3 before 100 ul of whole blood being
added at room temperature for 15 min in the dark.
Following ligation of red blood cells, white blood
cells were fixed and permeabilized by using
Cytofix/Cytoperm™ Fixation/Permeabilization Kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
APC-conjugated mouse anti-human NKIR and
FITC-conjugated mouse anti-human SP were added
to testing tube and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min
in the dark. Following washing with BD washing
buffer, the cell pellets were resuspended in
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-flow solution and analyzed with FACSVerse flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). A total
of 10,000 events were analyzed per population for
each sample. Data were analyzed with CellQuest
software (BD Immunocytometry systems).

To detect SP and NKIR expression on mouse
blood basophils, PerCP/Cy5.5-conjugated rabbit
anti-mouse CD49b and FITC-conjugated rabbit antimouse FceRIa antibodies were added to test tubes
before 100 tl of whole blood being added at room
temperature for 15 min in the dark. Following ligation of red blood cells, white blood cells were fixed
and permeabilized by using Cytofix/Cytoperm kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. APCconjugated anti-mouse SP and PE-conjugated antimouse NKIR antibodies were then added

D Springer
220

respectively to each tube for 30 min at 4 °C. A total
of 50,000 events were analyzed for each sample.

Basophil challenge and analysis of histamine release

For basophil challenge, 20 ml of peripheral blood from
healthy subjects or from patients with CSU was taken.
Ligation of red blood cells was carried out before cell
pellet being resuspended in HEPES-buffered salt solution (HBSS, pH 7.4) with CaCl, and MgCl, (complete
HBSS), and 100 ul aliquots containing approximately
1x 10° basophils were added to 50 tl of SP with or
without selective NK1R antagonist RP67580 (25 uM),
anti-IgE, Cl, and fMLP (in complete HBSS) in 96 well
plate and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction
was terminated by the addition of 100 tl of ice-cold
incomplete HBSS into each well, and the plates were
centrifuged immediately (500xg, 10 min, 4 °C). For the
measurement of total histamine concentration, the suspension in certain well was taken out and boiled for
6 min. Supernatants were stored at —20 °C until histamine concentration was determined. Histamine was determined by ELISA kits (Yagci et al. 2013).

For certain experiments, cells were preincubated with
metabolic inhibitors 2-deoxy-pD-glucose (10 mM) and
antimycin A (1 uM) or carrier alone for 30 min before
adding secretagogues. Histamine release was expressed as
a percentage of total cellular histamine levels and corrected
for the spontaneous release measured in wells in which
cells had been incubated with the HBSS diluent alone.

Mouse peritoneal injection

The procedure was adapted from that described previously (He et al. 1997). Briefly, various concentrations of
SP (0.1, 1.0, 10, and 100 ng/ml), eotaxin (0.1, 1.0, 10,
and 100 ng/ml), C3a (0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 pg/ml), and
normal saline (NS) were injected in 0.5 ml volumes into
the peritoneum of mice before their peritoneal lavage
being collected for differential cell analysis. At 10 min
and 3, 6, and 16 h following injection, animals were
killed, and their blood was collected into heparinized
tubes and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C.
Cells were resuspended in 2.0 ml MEM, stained with
0.1 % trypan blue, and enumerated using an Improved
Neubauer hemocytometer (for total cell numbers).
Cytocentrifuge preparations were made, air-dried, and
stained with modified Wright’s stain. Differential cell
counts were performed for a minimum of 500 cells. The

D Springer

results were expressed as absolute numbers of basophils
per mouse blood.

Mouse Sensitization and challenge

Mice were sensitized on days 0, 7, 14, and 21 with a
subcutaneous multipoint injection of 50 ug of OVA and
1.5 mg of Al(OH); suspended in NS to a total volume of
0.5 ml. Non-sensitized control animals received only the
equal volume (0.5 ml) of NS on the same days. On day
25, sensitized mice were challenged with intraperitoneal
injection of 0.5 ml of 1 % OVA. At 3 h following
injection, animal was killed and its blood was collected
for analysis.

Determination of levels of cytokines, SP, and sIgE

Levels of IL-4, IL-17F, TSLP, and SP were determined
by using ELISA kits according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. Specific (s) IgE was determined by
UniCAP kits.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS software (Version 17.0, IBM Corporation). Data for expression of SP and NKIR on basophils are displayed as
boxplots, which indicate the median, interquartile range,
the largest and smallest values for the number of experiments indicated. Plasma levels of SP and cytokines are
presented as scatter plots. Where Kruskal-Wallis analysis
indicated significant differences between groups, for the
pre-planned comparisons of interest, the paired Mann—
Whitney U test was employed. Data for basophil histamine release and for basophil number in mouse blood
were expressed as mean+SEM. Where analysis of variance indicated significant differences between groups
with ANOVA, Student’s ¢ test was applied. Correlations
were determined by using Spearman rank correlation.
For all analyses, P<0.05 was taken as significant.

Results

Levels of SP in plasma of patients with CSU and its
correlation with cytokines

In order to ensure potential roles of SP in CSU,
the most direct evidence is to examine its plasma
Cell Biol Toxicol (2016) 32:217-228

level. Using an ELISA kit, we observed that plasma SP level was approximately 3.5-fold higher
than the level in plasma of HC subject (Fig. 1a).
In contrast, IL-4 (Fig. 1b), IL-17F (Fig. 1c), and
TSLP (Fig. 1d) levels in plasma of the same group
of patients were lower than the levels in HC
subjects. In fact, IL-4 in plasma of CSU group
was not consistently detectable. While there were
negative correlations between the level of SP and
IL-17F (P<0.001) and TSLP (P<0.001) (Fig. 1f),
positive correlation between the level of SP and
absolute number of basophils (P<0.001) was observed in peripheral blood of CSU. In fact, the
number of basophils in peripheral blood of CSU
was clearly increased in comparison with that of
HC subjects (Fig. le). Among the 15 CSU patients, only 4 of them showed mild positive sIgE
test results, and all of the 4 were sensitive to crab
(values between 0.35 and 0.7 ku/l) though a total
of 20 specific allergens were tested.

Expression of SP in peripheral blood basophils
of patients with CSU

In order to explore the potential source of increased
plasma SP, we examined expression of SP in peripheral
blood basophils. The results showed that percentage of
SP+ basophils (Fig. 2g—i) and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI of SP in basophils (Fig. 2j, k) were markedly
elevated in CSU blood in comparison with HC blood.

Expression of NK1R in peripheral blood basophils
of patients with CSU

It is widely accepted that actions of SP are mainly
through activation of its receptor NKIR (Garcia-Recio
and Gascon 2015). However, expression of NKIR
on basophils remains uninvestigated. In order to
further understand actions of SP on basophils, we
explored expression of NKIR in peripheral blood
basophils. The results showed that percentage of

NKIR+ basophils (Fig. 3a—c) and MFI of NKIR

Induction of histamine release from basophils by SP

In order to understand actions of SP on basophils,
we investigated influence of SP on histamine

223

release from basophils. The results showed that
SP induced approximately up to 41.2 % net histamine release from basophils of CSU patients when
1.0 uM SP was added to basophils for 15 min. In
comparison, anti-IgE, Cl, and fMLP at the concentrations tested provoked up to 39.8, 35.2, and
47.6 % release of histamine, respectively.
RP67580 completely abolished SP-induced histamine release when it was preincubated with basophils for 30 min, indicating that SP-induced histamine release was mediated by NKIR (Fig. 4a). SP,
anti-IgE, CI, and fMLP also provoked histamine
release from basophils of HC subjects, though to
much less degrees (Fig. 4b). The metabolic inhibitors abolished SP, anti-IgE, Cl, and f{MLP-induced
histamine release, suggesting that histamine release
induced by them was non-cytotoxic (Fig. 4a, b).

Induction of elevated number of basophils in mouse
blood

In order to examine in vivo effect of SP on basophil
accumulation, SP was injected into mouse peritoneum.
The results showed that SP induced dramatic increase in
number of basophils in blood of mice at 10 min (Fig. 5a)

and 3 (Fig. 5b), 6 (Fig. 5c), and 16 h (Fig. 5d) following

until at least 16 h. It appeared that C3a was more potent
than SP in induction of basophil accumulation at the
later time points (Fig. 5).

Basophil number and expression of SP and NKIR
in basophils of sensitized mice

In order to investigate basophil number and expression
of SP and NKIR in basophils under allergic conditions,
mice were sensitized with OVA in the present study. The

of mice were enhanced by OVA-sensitization.

Discussion

We observed clearly that plasma level of SP and expression of SP and NKIR on basophils were elevated in
patients with CSU, suggesting strongly that SP contributes to the pathogenesis of CSU via basophils. Since SP
is a potent proinflammatory mediator, our current observation should be important for understanding mechanism of CSU.

It was reported previously that elevated level of SP
was observed in plasma of patients with atopic dermatitis (Salomon and Baran 2008), but not in plasma of
patients with psoriasis (Reich et al. 2007), suggesting
that increased SP level in plasma may be associated with
atopic conditions. Indeed, it was found that significantly

higher levels of SP were detected in atopic subjects than
in chronic ordinary urticaria patients. However, three
patients with positive autologous serum skin test and
negative basophil histamine release showed very high
substance P levels (Tedeschi et al. 2005). The discrimination between the present study and the above report
may be due to the freshness of clinical specimen as our
specimen had been collected within a month before
measurement, but the overall SP concentrations in the
previous reported study was relatively low. Another
reason could be different assay being used as they used
competitive enzyme immunoassay and our assay was
ELISA. Obviously, more properly designed study is
required for further addressing this issue.

It has been widely accepted that approximately 35 to
40 % of patients with CSU possess a circulating antibody directed to the alpha subunit of FeeRI (Kikuchi
and Kaplan 2001), which is a high-affinity type I IgE
receptor closely related to atopic conditions. Since
FceRI receptors mainly express on mast cells and basophils and autoantibodies can activate basophils through
IgE receptor (Chang et al. 2015), it implicates that

basophils are likely involved in pathogenesis of CSU
through IgE-mediated mechanism. While our experiments in the present study confirm that anti-human
IgE and autoplasma can potently induce histamine release from blood basophils of patients with CSU, it was
found for the first time that SP is also a potent stimulus
for CSU basophil degranulation. A report that intradermal injection of SP caused a wheal and flare reaction,
and basophil histamine release in atopic subjects (Louis
and Radermecker 1991), and a finding that SP induced
larger and longer wheals and flares in CSU (Borici-Mazi
et al. 1999) may support our current observation. It is
noticed that basophils from patients with CSU release
much more histamine than basophils from HC subjects
in response to IgE-mediated or non-IgE-mediated secretagogues, indicating further that basophils contribute to
development of CSU. The potency of SP in induction of
histamine release from basophils is comparable with
that induced by Cl, fMLP, and anti-IgE. The metabolic
inhibitors abolished SP-induced histamine release indicates that the action of SP is most likely a non-cytotoxic
event. A report that SP caused a non-cytotoxic histamine

release from basophils may support our observation relatively large NK1R+ basophil population observed

(Louis and Radermecker 1990). Taken together, increased level of SP observed in plasma of patients with
CSU, and SP being a potent stimulus of CSU basophil
degranulation, it is not difficult to understand the involvement of SP in the pathogenesis of CSU.
Complete inhibition of SP-induced histamine release from basophils of CSU patients by selective
NKIR antagonist suggests that SP-induced histamine
release is via NKIR. Hence, whether NKIR expresses on basophils becomes an issue to be answered as it remains unavailable. Although only a
small proportion of basophils expressing SP, a

in CSU, but not in HC subject blood implicates the
importance of NKIR in development of CSU.
NKIR appears another basophil receptor contributing
to CSU in addition to FceRI.

It is unexpected that plasma level of SP was negatively correlated with the levels of IL-4, IL-17F, and
TSLP in patients with CSU, which is most likely a
consequence of increased SP level vs. decreased IL-4,
IL-17F, and TSLP levels in CSU plasma. Since increased IL-4+ cells, and markedly elevated number of
TSLP+ cells, were detected in lesional skin from CSU
(Kay et al. 2015), we expect to see increased plasma

concentrations of IL-4 and TSLP in the current study.
This was obviously not the case. The report that TSLP
was not elevated in CSU (Metz et al. 2013) may help to
understand our observation that TSLP level decreased in
CSU plasma. There is little information on relationship
between plasma level IL-4 and CSU available; therefore, our observation that plasma IL-4 concentration
decreased in CSU may help to understand role of IL-4
in CSU. Concentration of IL-17F in CSU plasma has not
been reported previously. Our observation of decreased
concentration of IL-17F in CSU plasma suggests that
this proinflammatory cytokine may not play a role in
CSU. Similar observation on serum concentration of IL17 was reported previously, which suggested that IL-17
may not be involved in chronic urticaria (Arshi et al.
2014).

Although more than a dozen of articles related to
basophil activation playing a key role in CSU are published; few of them mentioned basophil number peripheral blood or skin tissue of CSU. Since basophil number
is equally (if not more) important than basophil activation status in CSU, we reported here that basophil number in peripheral blood was markedly elevated in CSU.
A study demonstrated that CSU subjects were associated with increased basophil numbers (total leukocyte
histamine content) (Oliver et al. 2015) may support
our observation.

Induction of basophil accumulation in blood by SP
proves further that SP is a causative factor of CSU. SP

induced basophil accumulation in blood seems via a
NKIR-dependent mechanism (Cima et al. 2010). The
potency of SP in induction of basophil accumulation
seems comparable to that induced by C3a, but greater
than that induced by eotaxin. Obviously, the detailed
mechanism behind SP-induced basophil accumulation
requires further study. Apart from basophils, it is possible that SP was derived from other type of cells and
bound to NK1R expressed on basophils, which also led
to the increase of SP+ basophils, but we did not pursue
this issue further in the present study.

In conclusion, the elevated plasma concentration
of SP, upregulated expression of SP and NKIR on
basophils, increased blood basophil numbers in the
patients with CSU, and the ability of SP in induction of basophil degranulation and accumulation
indicate strongly that SP is most likely a potent
proinflammatory mediator, which contributes greatly to the pathogenesis of CSU through basophils.
Inhibitors of SP and blockers of NK1R are likely
useful agents for treatment of CSU.
