Abstract

Background: Literature on efficacy of phototherapy in steroid dependent antihistamine
refractory chronic urticaria (CRU) is limited.

Objective: To assess and compare the efficacy of psoralen and ultra-violet A (PUVA) and

narrow band ultra-violet B (NB-UVB) in steroid dependent CRU.

Methods: \n this randomized prospective observer blinded comparative study, 50 patients of
steroid dependent CRU (6 months of spontaneous urticaria with no response from 3
consecutive months of antihistamines and steroid dependence) were administered either
PUVA (group A) or NB-UVB (group B) for 90 days, with a post treatment follow-up of 90
days. The treatment efficacy was assessed using average urticaria activity score7 (aUAS7)

and outcome scoring scale (OSS) every fortnightly.

Results: The mean values of aUAS7 progressively decreased from 4.9+0.8 and 5.0+0.7 at
baseline to 1.940.7 and 1.4+0.7 in groups A and B respectively by 90" day. This further
decreased to 1.5+0.8 and 1.4+1.0 at 180 day in both groups. The values of OSS
progressively increased from baseline (1.60.5 in group A and 1.3+0.5 in group B) to 3.9+0.3
and 4.0+0.3 in groups A and B respectively by 90" day and 3.9+0.5 and 4.0+0.6 by 180" day.
NB-UVB fared statistically better than PUVA at different time points. Adverse events

encountered were minimal and did not warrant treatment discontinuation.

Conclusion: Phototherapy, especially NB-UVB is an effective, safe and affordable

therapeutic modality for steroid dependent CRU and should be tried prior to 3" line treatment

options like omalizumab, cyclosporine and other immunosuppressants.

Introduction

Chronic urticaria (CU) is defined as occurrence of weals daily or almost daily, with or
without angioedema, for duration of 6 weeks or more.’ * According to recent European
Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) guidelines’, second-generation H1
antihistamines (AH1) are the first line treatment options for CU. Second line treatment option
is increasing the dose of an AHI by a maximum of 4 folds. CU has a prevalence of 0.5-1%
and almost 5-50% patients do not respond adequately to AH1.>> Third line treatment option
for such patients is addition of omalizumab, montelukast or cyclosporine. These agents have

systemic adverse effects and are expensive for patients ffom developing countries, who

usually lack insurance coverage. Therefore, a safer, effective and affordable treatment

modality is needed for patients of CU who have failed second line therapy.

Phototherapy has been found to be effective in treatment of mastocytosis®, dermographism/’
and CU.*" The exact mechanism of action of phototherapy in urticaria is unknown.
Reducing skin mast cell reactivity, degranulation and release of histamine and other proinflammatory mediators is one possible explanation. '4 Other plausible mechanisms include
apoptosis of dermal mast cells'*, immunomodulatory action and production of anti
inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10.! f

Ina randomized controlled trial, Engin et al'' found combination of narrow band ultra-violet
B (NB-UVB) and AH] to be better than AH1 alone for CU. In an open label study, Aydogan

1? observed NB-UVB to be beneficial in patients not responding to AH1. Olafgsson et al

eta
and Hannuksela et al’ reported positive results for Ultra-violet A (UVA) and broad-band
UVB respectively. Khafagy et al'> found NB-UVB and psoralen plus UVA (PUVA) to be

equally effective in 24 patients.

However, these studies have several limitations. Many of them include physical urticaria,
sample size is relatively small and the ones with larger numbers are either retrospective!” or
include patients that do not have AHI refractory CU.'! Hence, we conducted this prospective,
randomized, observer blinded study involving 50 patients to assess and compare the efficacy
of NB-UVB and PUVA in CU patients not responding to 4 fold increased AH1 doses
(chronic refractory urticaria, CRU) and dependent on recurrent intake of oral steroids for
relief. We also assessed the effect of phototherapy on serum IgE levels, autologous serum

skin test (ASST) and autologous plasma skin test (APST) of such patients.

Methods

Study design

This was a randomized, prospective, observer blinded comparative study conducted in a
tertiary care center. All consecutive CU patients with active disease, attending the urticaria
clinic of our institute from June 2013 to June 2014 were screened (n=526). A sample size of
50 patients was arbitrarily selected and consenting patients who fulfilled the inclusion and
exclusion criteria, were recruited (excluded physical urticaria n=100, CU not fulfilling other
inclusion criteria n=298, declined to participate n=78). The institute ethics committee
approved the study and all recruited patients signed an informed written consent. The overall

study design is depicted in Figure 1.

Inclusion criteria
1. Patients of CU with active disease (having hives associated with itching daily or
almost daily, with or without angioedema) for 6 months or more
and
2. Refractory disease, defined for present study as failure to respond to 4 folds increased
doses of 2"4 generation AHI given for at least 3 continuous months and requiring

repeated courses of oral corticosteroids (chronic refractory urticaria, CRU).

Exclusion criteria
Physical urticaria, urticarial vasculitis, acute urticaria, angioedema without weals,
photosensitive disorders, intake of photosensitizing medications, claustrophobia, pregnancy

and lactation, underlying hepatic and renal disease, cataract and history of anaphylaxis.

Previous treatments

Apart from AHI and steroids, patients had received leukotriene receptor antagonists (n=44)
and methotrexate (n=1) for ther CU with minimum relief For the present study, a washout
period of 1 month was advocated during which all treatments except AH1 were stopped. AH1
were allowed at maximum licensed doses during washout period. At the time of inclusion to
the study and starting of phototherapy, all patients were uniformly started on oral
levocetirizine 10 mg/day, which was continued through out the treatment period (90 days),

and was further reduced to 5 mg during the follow-up (91-180 days).

Randomization

Patients were randomized into two groups A and B using computer generated random
number tables; wherein, 25 random single and double-digit numbers from 1-50 were selected
before recruitment, and patients coming on these numbers were randomized in a particular
group. Random number generation, recruitment and randomization, were all done by the

same investigator (DP).

Patients in group A received 0.6 mg/kg of 8-methoxypsoralen followed by UVA 2 hours later
(PUVA) and patients in group B were treated with NB-UVB. Treatment was administered
using whole body phototherapy cabinets (Surya 440ANB, V-care/Cardiocare, UVA lampsPhilips TL-10R, NB-UVB lamps- Philips TL-01 100W). Phototherapy doses were initiated and
incremented based on Fitzpatrick skin types (III-V in our study), as per standard guidelines,

thrice weekly for a period of 90 days’.

Baseline evaluation

Complete hemogram, renal and liver function tests, thyroid function tests, thyroid
autoantibodies, serum IgE levels and ophthalmological evaluation to rule out pre-existing
cataract were done. Serum IgE levels above 100 IU/ml were considered abormal (as per
standardized chemi- luminescence immune assay done at our institute). ASST and APST were
performed at baseline using standard guidelines '* and were considered positive if average
diameter of weal induced by serum and plasma was greater than 2 mm in comparison to

diameter of weal induced by normal saline.

Treatment assessment and follow-up

The total study period for each patient was 180 days, divided equally between treatment and
follow-up (90 days each). Investigators blinded to random allocation (A and VK) assessed
the disease severity and treatment efficacy. Urticaria activity score (UAS)'? and outcome
scoring scale (OSS)'° were used to measure disease activity, symptomatic improvement,
frequency and extent of the disease (Table 1). Average UAS7 (aUAS7) over 7 days
(UAS7/7, range 0-6) was calculated at baseline before starting phototherapy. Patients were
instructed to write down number of weals and severity of itching in their daily urticaria diary.
Every fortnightly, aUAS7 for previous 7 days and OSS (range 1-5) were assessed. After
completion of phototherapy (90 days), serum IgE levels, ASST and APST were measured
again. Subsequently, patients were further followed up every fortnightly for 3 more months
using aUAS7 and OSS to evaluate for maintenance of treatment efficacy and relapse. The
follow-up of all patients was completed by December 2014. At the end of study period,
patients were asked to subjectively grade phototherapy as a treatment option for their CU on

scale of 0-10, with 0 being worst and 10 being the best (defined as patient satisfaction score).

Study end-points
Primary end-point
Change in aUAS7 from baseline to 90" day (at end of treatment) within group A and B and

comparison between groups A and B.

Secondary end-points
1. Change in OSS from baseline to 90" day within group A and B.
2. Change in aUAS7 and OSS from baseline to 180" day (end of follow-up) within
group A and B

and to adjust for multiple comparisons. All statistics were performed at a significance levelof

p=0.05.

Results:

Patients (Table 2)

The mean age of patients in-group A was 33.7+8.1 years (range 20-50 years) and that ingroup B was 35.5+11.7 years (range 19-65 years). There were 15 females and 10 males in
each group. The mean total duration of illness in-group A and B was 34.6+17.4 and

42.2+29.6 months respectively (range 1-5 years).

Baseline evaluation (Table 2)

The baseline mean aUAS7 in group A and B was 4.9+0.8 and 5.00.7 respectively. The mean
baseline OSS was 1.6+0.5 in group A and 1.3+0.5 in group B. Overall, 42 patients were
ASST positive (group A-20 and group B-22) and 43 were APST positive (group A-20 and
group B-23), with mean diameters of weals induced by serum and plasma being 10.4+3.1 and
11.2+3.4 mm respectively in group A and 9.9+2.1 and 11.0+2.6 mm respectively in group B.
Total serum IgE >100 IU/ml was noted in 39 patients (group A-20 and group B-19) with a
mean serum IgE level of 721.2+735.7 [U/ml in group A and 403.04305.9 IU/ml in group B.
Both groups were well matched and there was no significant difference between the two

groups regarding demographic parameters, baseline disease severity and investigations.

Response to phototherapy

Primary end-point

Change in aUAS7 from baseline to 90" day within and between groups

The mean values of aUAS7 progressively decreased from 4.9+0.8 and 5.0+0.7 to 1.9+0.7 and
1.4+0.7 in groups A and B respectively by 90" day (61.4% and 70.9% reduction from
baseline; Table 3, p<0.0001, repeated measure ANOVA, 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.43.7 and 2.9-4.2 for group A and B respectively). Statistically significant decline in aUAS7
was observed as early as 15'" day of starting phototherapy in both groups.

Reduction was statistically more significant in group B (p=0.022, Mann Whitney, 95%

CI-0.1 to 0.8).

Secondary end points

Change in aUA7S from baseline to 1 80" day

aUAS7 further decreased to 1.5+0.8 and 1.4+1.0 at 180" day in both groups (69.3% and
72.5% reduction from baseline; Table 3, p<0.0001, repeated measure ANOVA, 95% CI=2.7
4.1 and 2.7-4.5 for group A and B respectively).

Change in OSS

The values of OSS progressively increased from baseline (1.6£0.5 in group A and 1.3+0.5 in
group B) to 3.9+0.3 and 4.040.3 in groups A and B respectively by 90° day (Table 3,
p<0.0001, repeated measure ANOVA, 95% CI=-2.7 to -2.0 and -2.9 to -1.9 in group A and B
respectively) and 3.9+0.5 and 4.0+0.6 by 180" day (Table 3, p<0.0001, repeated measure

ANOVA, 95% CI=-2.9 to -1.9 and -3.2 to -2.1 in group A and B respectively).

Comparison between groups

Change in aUAS7

The reduction in aUAS7 was more significant in group B on 45", 75 and 90" day during
treatment and on 30" day during follow-up, in comparison to group A (Figure 2a, p=0.005,
0.033, 0.022 and 0.001, Mann Whitney; 95% CI for difference=0.2-1.0, 0.03-0.6, 0.1-0.8

and 0.3-1.2 respectively).

Change in OSS

On comparing the two groups, the increase in OSS was more significant in group B on 15",
30" and 45" day during treatment and on 30 day during follow up (Figure 2b, p=0.018,
0.002, 0.001 and 0.037, Mann Whitney; 95% CI for diffe rence=-0.6 to -0.1, -0.7 to -0.2, 
0.8 to -0.2 and -0.02 to -0.5 respectively).

Patient satisfaction score and treatment

Average patient satisfaction score was 7.6 in group A and 7.9 in group B (Table 3).

Effect on ASST and APST

From baseline to 90" day, a significant reduction in diameters of weals produced by serum
and plasma was observed in both groups (6.742.7 and 7.1+2.6 mm for serum and plasma
respectively in group A and 7.8+3.5 and 7.6+3.3 mm in group B, Figure 3a, p<0.0001 in
group A, p=0.023 and <0.0001 for serum and plasma in group B). Eighteen patients (9 in
each group) were ASST positive and a similar number of patients were APST positive (group
A-10 and group B-8; Figure 3b) at end of treatment. The trend for number of patients with
positive ASST/APST to turn negative post phototherapy was significant in both the groups (p

< 0.003, McNemar test).

Effect on total serum IgE levels

At the end of treatment, 38 patients (baseline- 39) demonstrated total serum IgE levels >100
IU/ml (Figure 3b, Table 3). When compared with baseline values (721.2+735.7 [U/ml in
group A and 403.0+305.9 IU/ml in group B), a statistically significant reduction in serum IgE
levels at 90" day was seen in only group A (441.7 + 407.3 IU/ml and 330.6 + 251.1 IU/ml in
group A and B respectively; Table 3, p=0.002).

Adverse effects

Six patients (24%) in group A complained of nausea compared to none in group B (p=0.022).
Xerosis and tanning was seen in 14(56%) and 13(52%) patients in each group respectively.

Melasma was observed in 5 patients (2-group A and 3- group B).

Treatment response, relapse and residual disease activity

At the end of treatment (90'" day), 1 patient was clear of urticaria, 46 (92%) had marked
improvement and 3 had moderate improvement. At the end of follow-up (180 day), 4
patients achieved clearance. Forty-two patients (84%) had marked improvement with 27
complaining of mild residual pruritus in absence of weals (aUAS7 over 7 days = 1), 15 (9group A, 6-group B) having minimal residual weals which appeared occasionally, were lesser
in number compared to baseline and spontaneously improved in a short time. Two had
moderate and 1 had minimal improvement (Table 3). Relapse was seen in only | patient

(group B).

Associated findings
Fourteen patients were found positive for circulating anti- microsomal thyroid autoantibodies,
with clinical hypothyroid disease in 10 patients. A personal history of atopy was observed in

16 patients (A-7, B-9) with family history of atopy in 6 patients (3 patients in both groups).

Discussion

A proportion of CU patients have persistent weals despite taking maximum licensed doses of
AH1, which significantly affects thei quality of life and results in repeated intake of systemic
corticosteroids for relief.” Various immunosuppressants/immunomodulators have been tried
in this subset of patients, with variable outcome.”! Phototherapy is not recommended as a

treatment option for such patients in any of the standard urticaria treatment guidelines.

Midelfart K et al? first reported improvement in CU following PUVA therapy in a patient
who had co-existing vitiligo and CU. Few subsequent studies reported beneficial effect of
different phototherapeutic modalities in the treatment of cu.*® Most of these studies are
limited by small sample size and lack of definition of the baseline refractoriness of disease.
Engin et al'' compared antihistamines plus NB-UVB with antihistamines alone in a
randomized controlled trial and observed that combination group had significantly more
improvement in UAS as compared to antihistamine alone group, although both had
Statistically significant improvement. Also, improvement in combination group was
maintained during follow-up, whereas that in antihistamine alone group was not maintained
and patients quickly relapsed during follow-up period. Both NB-UVB and PUVA were found
to be significantly effective in our study, though; NB-UVB fared statistically better than
PUVA at multiple points during treatment and follow-up. As NB-UVB has already been

proven to be effective in randomized controlled study by Engin et al'', we can conclude that

PUVA is also effective. Clinically, minimum important difference (MID) for UAS7 has been
defined between 9.5-10.5.7> The difference in aUAS7 between baseline and 90" day as
observed by us was 3.0 and 3.6 in PUVA and NB-UVB groups respectively, amounting to
UAS7 of 21 and 25.2. Therefore, although statistically NB-UVB fared better at certain timepoints; clinically, with regard to MID, both NB-UVB and PUVA fared almost equally well.

This was also appreciated by almost similar patient satisfaction scores.

We observed clinical improvement as early as day 15 in both groups (about 7 sessions of
phototherapy) and improvement achieved during treatment period was also maintained
during the follow up period. Patients requiring repeated steroid intake responded effectively
to a single daily dose of levocetirizine 10 mg, which could further be reduced to 5 mg during
follow up period. In our experience, patients continued to be in clinical remission with none
or minimal dosages of AH1 for as long as | year after release from the study (unpublished
data). Aydogan et al’? studied 22 CU patients (19 with skin type ID) using OSS and noticed
clearance in 45%, marked improvement in 22% and moderate improvement in 31% patients;
whereas Berroeta et al!° in a retrospective review, noted 40% clearance, 15% marked
improvement and 45% moderate improvement at the end of treatment using NB-UVB (most
patients with phototypes I to III). Khafagy et al!? compared NB-UVB and PUVA in 24
patients and found both to be equally efficacious with 58.3% patients improving in NB-UVB
group and 50% in PUVA group. Incontrast, we observed complete clearance in only 4% and
marked improvement in 92% in our cohort. This was due to persistent mild pruritus in 54%
of patients who were otherwise free of active weals, but were scored having aUAS7 of 1 or
OSS of 4 and hence classified as having marked improvement rather than complete
clearance. This persisting pruritus could be due to underlying hypothyroidism (20%), atopy

(32%) or phototherapy induced xerosis (>50%) instead of persistent disease activity and

responded effectively to application of emollients. Treatment of hypothyroidism might have

also influenced the results of our study, which was not accounted for in the study design.

Omalizumab has been found to be beneficial for CU patients not responding to AH1**.
Baseline UAS7 values in the group receiving 300 mg omalizumab per month were 29.5+6.9,
which are comparable to baseline aUAS7 in our NB-UVB group (5.0+0.7, which
approximates 7 of 34.7). At 12 weeks of treatment, reduction in UAS7 was 21.7+12.8 in
omalizumab 300 mg group, which is comparable to a reduction of 3.5+0.2 in aUAS7 seen in
NB-UVB group in our study (amounting to UAS7 of 24.6). Moreover, patients receiving
more than licensed doses of AHI (more than 5 mg levocetirizine) were excluded from the
omalizumab study” 4. whereas, we included patients who were refractory to even 4 fold
increased dosages of AHI. Cruz et aP* reported a modest increase in geohelminth infections
in allergic patients receiving omalizumab. This may be of concern for use of omalizumab in
tropical countries where geohelminthic infestations are common. In contrast to omalizumab,
phototherapy is a time-tested therapeutic modality. Thus phototherapy appears to be a safer

and equally effective alternative for patients having refractory urticaria.

More than 80% of study cohort had positive ASST/APST at baseline, of which a significant
number became negative post treatment (64%, p<0.05), which reflects inhibition of serum
histamine releasing factors brought about by NB-UVB and PUVA. To the best of our
knowledge, effect of phototherapy on ASST/APST has not been studied previously; the
results observed by us are encouraging and further studies are required to study this aspect
more extensively. Huilan Z et al’ reported IgE sensitization to be higher in CU patients and

with 39 patients having levels more than normal, same held true for our study. There are no

previous studies documenting the effect of phototherapy on IgE levels in CU, although
similar studies have been performed in atopic dermatitis”’ and psoriasis”*® with variable
results. We noted a significant reduction in serum IgE levels post treatment in only PUVA
treated group; however, the number of patients with raised serum IgE levels did not alter
significantly post treatment in any of the groups. The exact mechanism by which PUVA

brings about this change in IgE levels needs to be explored further.

Circulating thyroid autoantibodies and clinical hypothyroid disease were noted in 28% and
20% of study cohort respectively and was significantly higher in comparison to that reported
previously.2? Autoimmunity and clinical hypothyroidism might have led to treatment
refractory, severe disease in our patients. Co-expression of allergic disease in CU patients is
known.*° A personal history of atopy was observed in 32% patients of our cohort, which
could be explained on basis of similar nature of both diseases with a predominant Th2

pathway.

There were no dropouts indicating efficacy, tolerability and patient acceptance of the
treatment provided. Common adverse effects included tanning and xerosis, which improved
considerably with liberal application of emollients and sunscreens beyond phototherapy
hours. Nausea and gastrointestinal adverse effects were reported only in PUVA group (24%).
Mean patient satisfaction scores of 7.6 and 7.9 for PUVA and NB-UVB respectively prove

patient acceptability, safety and efficacy of this treatment option for CRU.

Limitations

The limitation of the current study is shorter duration of follow-up. Longer follow-up period
is required to ascertain maintained efficacy and relapse rate. Though subjective improvement
perceived by the patient was assessed using patient satisfaction score, a specific quality of life
measurement score for urticaria would be better. Random sample-size estimation and absence

of pre-specified values of outcome measures are other limitations.

One of the perceived limitations of the current study is a lack of placebo group. However,
withholding a potentially effective treatment in patients of severe refractory urticaria could
not be ethically justified. Lack of placebo group did not allow us to definitely exclude the
possibility of spontaneous remission. But, all our patients had prolonged and severe disease
(mean disease duration > 34 months, mean continuous treatment duration > 25 months,
corticosteroid dependence and baseline aUAS7 >4.9) that exceeded the time window
normally associated with spontaneous remission. Hence, we can attribute significant

improvement observed in our study to phototherapy.

Conclusion

Both PUVA and NB-UVB work effectively in CRU. Overall, NB-UVB is easy to administer
and is devoid of gastrointestinal side effects. We propose that phototherapy is a safe,
effective and affordable treatment option for patients having steroid dependent antihistamine
refractory CU. It, therefore, should be employed before omalizumab, cyclosporine and other

immunosuppressants and should also be included in standard urticaria treatment guidelines.
