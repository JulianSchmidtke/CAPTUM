Background: Currently, severe allergic asthma and food allergy in children represent an important public health
problem with medical, psychosocial and economic impacts. Omalizumab is a humanized monoclonal anti-lgE
antibody, approved for refractory allergic asthma and chronic urticaria. It has been widely used in clinical practice as
add-on therapy in patients with severe uncontrolled allergic asthma. In recent years there has seen the emergence
of an allergic epidemic with increasing food allergy, which represents the main cause of anaphylaxis in children.
The standard of care for food allergy is strictly dietary allergen avoidance and emergency treatment, but recent
clinical trials have suggested that omalizumab may have a role to play as an adjuvant to oral immunotherapy (OIT).
We present a case series of patients treated at our institution with omalizumab for severe allergic asthma and food

Methods: Patients received omalizumab according to a standard reference nomogram after failing standard
therapies. In children with comorbid severe food allergy, omalizumab was administered in conjunction with an oral

Results: Omalizumab was effective in controlling symptoms of allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis and rhinosinusitis,
but not eosinophilic esophagitis, while aiding successful oral desensitization of comorbid severe food allergies.

Conclusions: Omalizumab appears to be an excellent therapeutic option in children with inadequately controlled
severe allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis and rhinosinusitis, with or without food allergy.

Backgrouds

Omalizumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody (mAb)
that binds to the Fce portion of the immunoglobulin (Ig)E
antibodies, reducing total IgE levels, preventing interaction
with the high-affinity receptors (FceRI) expressed on the
surface of target cells, receptor expression and interrupting
the resulting inflammatory cascade [1].

Omalizumab has been licensed since 2003 by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of
moderate-to-severe allergic asthma in adults and adolescents (212 years) with sensitization to a perennial allergen
and symptoms not adequately controlled by inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) [2]. In 2005, the European Medicines

Agency (EMA) approved it as add-on therapy for the
treatment of persistent severe allergic asthma not controlled by daily high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)
plus inhaled long-acting B2-agonist (LABA) therapy in
adults and adolescents (age > 12 years) [3]. Omalizumab
was subsequently approved by the EMA [4] and the FDA
[2] in children aged 6 to 12 years with severe persistent allergic uncontrolled asthma. Furthermore, in 2014, the
FDA and EMA endorsed the drug for the treatment of
spontaneous chronic urticaria in adult and adolescent patients (age>12years) with inadequate response to
H1-antihistamines [2, 5].

The clinical efficacy and safety of omalizumab have
already been extensively demonstrated in many studies
[6-29], including in pediatric patients. Several clinical
trials have also explored the use of the Omalizumab in
the treatment of other diseases in which IgE play a role

(such as allergic rhinitis, food and drugs allergy, anaphylaxis,
keratoconjunctivitis, urticaria, angioedema, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, atopic dermatitis, non-allergic
asthma, Churg-Strauss syndrome, nasal polyposis, chronic
rhinosinusitis, eosinophilic otitis media, bullous pemphigoid, contact dermatitis, mastocytosis) with promising results [30-32].

In this study, we present a case series of eight patients
treated with omalizumab for severe persistent asthma
and/or severe food allergy.

Patients and methods

All patients were followed at the Pediatric Allergy, University Hospital “Gaetano Martino” in Messina, Italy. At
the start of the study, previous and maintenance treatments, adverse events, comorbidities, specific and total
IgE levels, history of emergency room accesses and hospitalizations were recorded (Table 1). A skin prick test
(SPT) and asthma control test (ACT) were performed.
At each follow-up visit, anthropometric and clinical data,
of pulmonary function tests (PFTR), administered standard therapy together with any changes, and adverse
events were recorded (Table 2). Overall data on SPT
wheal diameter, total and specific IgE variation, treatment duration are reported in Table 3. Asthma diagnosis
and severity were periodically reassessed according to
GINA Guidelines [33]. Adverse drug reaction (ADR) to
omalizumab were registered at each visit according to
EMA guidelines [4].

All parents signed a written informed consent on behalf of their child. Patients with food allergy were treated
with omalizumab off-label. Therefore, the study design
was submitted to and approved by the Ethics Committee
of University.

Case presentations

Case 1

A 13-year-old boy had suffered from severe allergic
asthma since preschool age. He had house dust mite
(HDM) and olive pollen allergy detected by SPT (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus [DP] 9 mm, Dermatophagoides
farinae [DF] 7mm and Olive pollen 5mm) and specific
IgE levels (100, 82 and 68IU/mL, respectively), with high
total IgE (1003 IU/mL) levels and normal eosinophil count
(110/mmc) (Table 1). The pulmonary function tests
(PFTs) were constantly abnormal, with a forced expiratory
volume in 1s (FEV1) < 80% of the predicted value before
bronchodilation. He had poor disease control, despite
daily high-dose ICS plus inhaled LABA and leukotriene
receptor antagonist (LTRA), previous sublingual specific
immunotherapy (SLIT) with dust mite extract (continuously for 3 years from the age of 5), during which he experienced many exacerbations (Table 2).

Page 2 of 11

He also suffered from the age of 8 years from mild persistent allergic rhinitis treated with intranasal corticosteroids and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) confirmed by
endoscopic and histological findings.

In this context, SPT was performed and revealed a
sensitization to milk and soy (milk extract 8mm; Bos d
4=10mm; Bos d 5=7mm; Bos d 8=6mm; Prick by
prick [PBP] with fresh milk 10mm and soy [5 mm]).
The first approach to EoE included a semi-elemental
diet and a strict soy/milk avoidance which lead to symptomatic and histological relief. Due to the poor palatability, he suspended the diet after three months.

When he was 11 years old, he experienced worsening
asthmatic symptoms, requiring emergency room access
and hospitalizations. Therefore, he started therapy with
omalizumab (375 mg subcutaneously) every 2 weeks, according to the reference nomogram for body weight and
total IgE level [4]. Overall the patient received omalizumab for 18 months with clinical and spirometric improvement. After three months of therapy, the
long-term treatment with high-dose ICS plus inhaled
LABA and LTRA was gradually reduced until its suspension, at the 12th month of therapy with omalizumab
(Table 2). According to Global Initiative for Asthma
(GINA)-guided assessment [33], he continued to have
good asthma control over time with normal spirometric
parameters (FEV1 99%, forced expiratory flow at 2575% of the pulmonary volume [FEF25—75] 70%). Furthermore, he showed a reduction of the average wheal
diameter for mites and olive tree (DP 6mm, DF 5mm,
olive 3mm) serum IgE (sIgE) (DP 59.3 KU/L, DF 36.3
KUI/L, olive tree 1.41 KU/LI) with lower total IgE (490
IU /mL) (Table 3).

The treatment response in EoE was assessed by evaluating the change in clinical symptoms score (Pediatric
Eosinophilic Esophagitis Symptom Score [PEESS’ v2.0])
and by endoscopy with biopsy findings [34, 35]. There
was a non-significant histological change during omalizumab therapy despite a mild decrease in symptom
score. Therefore, he started oral viscous budesonide
(BUD) with clinical and histological relief but recurrence
of symptoms when steroids were discontinued.

Case 2

A 15-year-old boy presented with severe allergic asthma,
moderate persistent allergic rhinitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis. The rhinosinusitis symptoms were quite troublesome (visual analog scale [VAS] =5) despite long-term
therapy with nasal saline irrigation, oral antibiotic >12
weeks and intranasal corticosteroids. During the work-up
and according to the EPOS guidelines, cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, immunodeficiencies, anatomical
abnormalities and nasal polyposis were excluded [36].

Abbreviation: IgE immunoglobulin E

Asthma appeared in preschool age but worsened in
the recent years; it was not controlled by daily high-dose
ICS, inhaled LABA and LTRA. He had HDM and pellitory allergy detected by SPT (DP 5mm, DF 6mm and
pellitory 5 mm) with sIgE levels (100, 100 and 12 IU/mL,
respectively) and high total IgE (372 IU/mL). Spirometry
showed a persistent reversible airflow obstruction pattern (FEV1 70%, FEF25—75 < 50%). A SLIT with HDM
was attempted when he was 7 years old but discontinued
because of asthma exacerbations (Table 1).

Therefore, he started omalizumab (450 mg subcutaneously) every 4 weeks, according to the reference nomogram [4]. After nine months of therapy, he achieved
better asthma control with FEV1 > 80% and started the
ICS +LABA treatment step-down until its suspension.
He underwent omalizumab therapy for a total of 24
months, at the end of which he showed asthma remission and normal spirometric values (FEV1 98%, FEF25—

75 73%). At the end of the treatment, total IgE were 760
IU/mL and sIgE DP 100 KU/L, DF 100 KU/L, pellitory
3.85 KU/L (Tables 2 and 3). Under omalizumab he also
experienced an improvement in symptoms (VAS = 2)
and clinical signs of chronic rhinosinusitis, suggesting
the role of IgE in the pathogenesis of the mucosal inflammation as suggested by other studies [37].

Case 3

A 10-year-old boy with severe cow's milk allergy (CMA)
and moderate-severe allergic asthma was followed at our
allergy outpatient clinic.

Asthmatic symptoms, which started at the age of 4
years, were controlled at first by ICS at medium dosage
and LTRA, and then from high-dose ICS (fluticasone up
to 500 mcg/day) + LABA, with an FEV1 of 76%. He had
HDM, pellitory and cat allergy confirmed by SPT (DP 5
Crisafulli et al. Italian Journal of Pediatrics (2019) 45:13

mm, DF 4mm, pellitory 5mm, cat dander 4mm) with
sIgE levels (DP 23.4, DF 17.1, pellitory 20.7, cat dander
9.51 KU/L) and high total IgE (668 IU/mL) (Table 1).

The diagnosis of CMA was made at the age of 2
months and confirmed at further stages through SPT
(milk 16mm, Bos d 4= 13mm, Bos d 5=11mm, Bos d
8 = 12mm), sIgE (milk > 100 KU/L, Bos d 8 > 100 KU/L,
Bos d 4= 15.8 KU/L, Bos d 5 = 9.26 KU/L) and oral food
challenge (OFC) (Table 3).

Spontaneous remission of CMA did not occur over
time, and the child experienced four anaphylactic adverse reactions from accidental ingestion of foods containing hidden milk proteins and bronchospasm after
inhalation of powder containing cow’s milk proteins. At
the age of 10, after achieving better asthma control, he
started oral immunotherapy (OIT) to milk after a protocol already tested at our Centre [38] failed because of
anaphylaxis after 0.5 mL of milk.

Therefore, on the basis of recent evidence, he received
omalizumab in combination with oral milk desensitization
[39]. The protocol consisted of three steps:

1. Nine weeks of pre-treatment with omalizumab
(300 mg subcutaneously every two weeks according
to the reference nomogram).

2. A second phase (from 9th to 16th week)
characterized by the association of omalizumab and
OIT. Oral cow’s milk desensitization was performed
in 2 phases: a rush phase on the first day (starting
with 5 drops of milk, with increasing doses every
30 min to a maximum of 30 mL corresponding to
1000 mg of cow’s milk proteins) and a slow phase
with weekly increases in the dose of milk which, if
tolerated, was taken at home.

3. A “consolidation” phase (from 17th to 24th week) in
which omalizumab was discontinued and the
patient carried out only OIT with a weekly visit to
the Day-Hospital.

He presented an excellent response, achieving 140 mL
of milk during the third phase.

Unfortunately, two weeks after a viral, milk consumption in the same amounts previously tolerated triggered
life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring hospitalization.
This adverse reaction was probably worsened by infection, as reported in the literature [40]. The patient’s parents decided to discontinue OIT and resume a cow’s
milk protein-free diet. Evaluations performed after 6
months showed total IgE = 309 IU/mL with milk sIgE >
100 KU/L, Bos d 8>100 KU/L, Bos d 4= 20.3 KU/L,
Bos d 5 = 8.4 KU/L (Table 3).

Regarding allergic asthma, omalizumab therapy allowed
the step-down of ICS+LABA (starting from the 12th
week of anti-IgE treatment) until achieving its suspension.

He presented normal lung function parameters with sIgE
DP and DF > 100 KU/L (Table 1).

Case 4

A 9-year-old girl was admitted to the intensive care unit
with acute respiratory failure (ARF), pneumothorax
(PNX) and pneumomediastinum after a serious asthma attack. Asthma severity was underestimated and the symptoms undertreated, despite being diagnosed with allergic
asthma at the age of 5 (SPT DP 5mm, DF 3 mm, sIgE DP
62.8, DF 31.3 KU/L and total IgE 280 IU/mL) (Table 1). At
admission, chest radiography and computed tomography
(CT) scan documented bilateral apical PNX, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema extended to the
soft tissues of the thorax and neck.

After resolution of the ARF, the main causes of spontaneous secondary PNX and pneumomediastinum (such
as congenital malformations, foreign body inhalation
and/or toxic substances, cystic fibrosis, trauma, pneumonia, interstitiopathies) were reviewed, confirming the relationship with severe uncontrolled chronic asthma
(FEV1 61% of predicted).

The patient started high-dose ICS (fluticasone 500 mcg/
die) plus LABA (100 mcg/die) and LTRA (10 mg/die),
achieving partial control as shown by ACT and spirometry
at 4, 8 and 12 weeks (Table 2). Therefore, she started omalizumab (150mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks), according
to the reference nomogram [4] for 24 months. During
follow-up, there was a gradual improvement in respiratory
performances and inflammation conditions, shown by spirometry (3rd month: FEV1 67%, 6th month: FEV1 73%, 6th
month: FEV1 79%, 12th month: FEV1 85%) and reduction
in exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) before and after treatment
(35 vs 8 ppb). A reduction of total IgE (126 IU/mL) was also
observed with sIgE almost unchanged (DP 70, DF 30.9 KU/
mL) (Table 3). At the same time, it was possible to proceed
with the gradual step down of inhalation therapy (from
high-dose ICS + LABA + LTRA to low-dose ICS) (Table 2).

Case 5

A 7-year-old girl was referred to the allergy outpatient
Clinic for severe CMA, dating from the first year of life.
Food allergy was confirmed by SPT (milk 7 mm, Bos d 4
=6mm, Bos d 5=5mm, Bos d 8=7mm), sIgE (milk
20.9 KU/L, Bos d 8=18.1 KU/L, Bos d 4=5.73 KU/L,
Bos d 5 = 3.49 KU/L) and a positive OFC (resulting in
anaphylaxis after 4mL of fresh milk) (Table 1). At the
age of 6, she started OIT to milk following a protocol
already tested at our Centre [38], achieving the dose of
35mL after 12 months of therapy. However, she presented with anaphylaxis after 40 mL of milk, resulting in
interruption of OIT. A year later, following the pioneering work of Nadeau et al. [39] she started desensitization
to milk in combination with omalizumab therapy (75 mg
Crisafulli et al. Italian Journal of Pediatrics (2019) 45:13

every 4 weeks according to the reference nomogram [4])
following the protocol already described for patient
number 3. The girl was able to tolerate ordinary daily
milk amounts, but after 4weeks of food avoidance due
to personal considerations, she presented an adverse reaction characterized by urticaria and angioedema after
the introduction of 30mL of milk. She restarted rush
OIT lasting 2 days, after which she reintroduced milk
into her diet without any adverse reaction. Two months
after stopping OIT and 4 months from the last omalizumab injection, she is introducing milk and dairy products into her diet at least several days per week.

Alongside milk desensitization, there was a decline in
total IgE, sIgE (milk 8.93 KU/L, Bos d 8=5.18 KU/L,
Bos d 4 = 4.09 KU/L, Bos d 5 = 1.6 KU/L, total IgE 35 IU
/mL) and SPT mean wheal diameter (milk 4mm, Bos d
8 =4mm, Bos d 4=3 mm, Bos d 5 =2 mm) (Table 3).

Case 6
A 14-year-old boy with severe CMA and moderate-severe
allergic asthma was followed at our allergy outpatient
clinic.

His respiratory symptoms started in preschool, then
he developed allergy to HDM, cat and dog (SPT mean
wheal diameter DP 4mm, DF 3mm, cat 4mm, dog 5
mm, sIgE DP 1.18 KU/L, DF 1.12 KU/L, cat 1 KU/L,
dog 5.36 KU/L, with total IgE 597 IU/mL). Asthma was
controlled by high dose ICS plus LABA (Table 1).

CMA was diagnosed at the age of 10 months, confirmed by SPT (milk 8mm, Bos d 4= 13.5 mm, Bos d 5
=8mm, Bos d 8=11mm, PBP 11mm), sIgE (milk 90
KU/L, Bos d 8 62.3 KU/L, Bos d 4 62.5 KU/L, Bos d 5 =
36.6 KU/L), and OFC performed at pre-established intervals (Table 1). He followed a milk and dairy free diet but
presented two anaphylaxis episodes from accidental exposure to milk at the age of six and eight years.

OIT was attempted at the age of 13 but was unsuccessful due to adverse reactions and poor compliance. A
year later he underwent OIT plus omalizumab (450 mg
every 4 weeks according to the reference nomogram) [4].

The experimental protocol was modified a little from
the one given above, and characterized by:

1. First step: (0-8 weeks) pre-treatment with
omalizumab.

2. Second step: (8-48 weeks) combined therapy
(omalizumab plus OIT) with a rush desensitization
phase lasting 2 days and a slow phase with a
monthly dose increase (25% at a time) in the
outpatient clinic and continuing daily home intake
of the maximum tolerated milk amount.

3. Third step: (48-60 weeks) only OIT and
subsequently free diet with monthly follow-up.

Page 7 of 11

Although anti-IgE therapy was prolonged for a total of
48 weeks, milk desensitization failed. From the second
month of combined therapy, the patient experienced a
mild-to-moderate adverse reaction slowing escalation of
the milk dose. At the 52nd week of therapy, he presented
with anaphylaxis after 10 mL of milk and the study protocol was interrupted. This lack of success was also probably
due to the poor family adherence; in fact, the patient did
not regularly take milk at home, and sometimes the outpatient appointments were postponed. A year after stopping the study protocol, an increase both in total IgE (930
IU/mL) and sIgE (milk> 100 KU/L, Bos d 8>100 KU/L,
Bos d 4>100 KU/L, Bos d 5=69.3 KU/L) was observed.
However, during therapy with omalizumab, he showed
clinical improvement of asthma symptoms and respiratory
function parameters (FEV1 80%) with the chance to start
the step-down of inhalation therapy (from the third
month of treatment) (Table 2). Currently, the boy has mild
allergic asthma well controlled by low-dose ICS and continues a milk- and dairy-free diet.

Case 7

Severe CMA affected an eight-year-old boy from the age
of nine months. A last positive OFC was performed at
the age of two years, and then he continued a cow’s milk
proteins-free diet. He suffered from anaphylaxis at the
age of 5 because of accidental exposure to milk. During
his first outpatient visit, CMA was confirmed by SPT
(milk 7 mm, Bos d 4= 12mm, Bos d 5=6mm, Bos d 8
= 11mm, PBP 15mm), sIgE (milk 25.1 KU/L, Bos d 8 =
16 KU/L, Bos d 4=5.99 KU/L, Bos d 5=4.24 KU/L,
with total IgE 79.9 IU/mL), and a positive OFC (anaphylaxis after 3 mL of milk) (Table 1).

Milk OIT was proposed and started without success
because anaphylaxis occurred at 1.5 mL of milk.

Therefore, on the basis of scientific evidence [39] in a
patient at high risk of serious food adverse reactions and
refractory to traditional OIT [41], omalizumab-assisted
desensitization to milk was proposed and started.

The oral desensitization protocol to milk was similar
to the one already described for subject number 3 and
included pre-treatment with omalizumab (75 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 9 weeks according to reference nomogram [4]), a second phase of combined
therapy (omalizumab plus OIT) lasting 7 weeks and finally a third step during which the subject only underwent milk OIT. The results of the study protocol were
exceptional, and the boy was able to include milk and
dairy products into the diet at least several days per
week without any adverse event.

Moreover, a reduction of total and specific IgE levels was
observed (total IgE 71 IU/mL, milk 9 KU/L, Bos d 8 = 4.06
KUIL, Bos d 4 = 2.93 KU/L, Bos d 5 = 1.61 KU/L) (Table 3).

Case 8

An 11-year-old boy with allergic moderate-severe asthma,
mild-moderate persistent rhinitis, and severe CMA was
followed at our allergy outpatient clinic.

He had HDM, pellitory pollen and cat dander allergy
confirmed by SPT (DP 4mm, DF 5 mm, Parietaria judaica 5mm, cat dander 5mm) and sIgE (17,1 KU/L, 23.4
KU/L, 20.7 KU/L, and 9.51 KU/L respectively), with high
total IgE (972 1U/mL) levels. Asthma was not well controlled by ICS (fluticasone 500 mcg/die) plus LABA,
while rhinitis was treated with nasal corticosteroids and
oral antihistamines.

CMA was diagnosed at the age of 3 months and persisted over the years. The patient experienced 4 episodes
of anaphylaxis, after accidental exposure to traces of
cow's milk proteins, needing hospitalization. When he
was 8-years old, he started conventional OIT at another
Allergy Clinic, following a different protocol [42]. During
the rush phase, he presented with anaphylaxis after 3 mL
of milk diluted in 20mL of water and OIT was
discontinued.

At the age of 10, after reviewing SPT (milk 16mm,
Bos d 8=6mm, Bos d 4= 16mm, Bos d 5=21 mm) we
tried to restart conventional OIT [38] with bad results
(anaphylaxis after 4 drops of milk).

After a year, we reassessed allergy tests (SPT: Milk =
16mm, Bos d 4=11mm, Bos d5=12mm, Bos d 8=18
mm, PBP 17 mm; sIgE: milk > 100 KU/L, Bos d 8 > 100
KU/L, Bos d 4=15.8 KU/L, Bos d 5=9.26 KU/L) and
started omalizumab-assisted desensitization to milk.

He received omalizumab (300mg every 4 weeks according to the reference nomogram [4]) and OIT following the same protocol as patient number 6. He was able
to drink 180 mL of milk after stopping omalizumab but
experienced anaphylaxis again during a viral pharyngitis,
and the protocol was interrupted.

Asthma exacerbations reduced and spirometry improved (pre-FEV1 76% vs. post 89%) during anti-IgE
therapy. Therefore he started step-down of inhalation
therapy (currently he is on low-dose ICS).

Safety
In total, all of subjects in our series presented at least one
ADR during therapy. The most commonly reported ADRs
(N=7), were local reactions (pain, erythema, and edema
at the site of injection). Other adverse events were also reported, such as asthenia (N= 1), fever (N= 1), headache
(N= 4), and generalized malaise (N = 1) after drug administration. None of these adverse events required discontinuation of treatment or hospitalization. No case of
IgE-mediated adverse reaction or anaphylaxis has been reported. Regarding OIT, many adverse food reactions were
registered, as reported in Table 4.

Discussion

Of our series of eight subjects, six had moderate-severe
allergic asthma and, among these, four were not controlled or were only partially controlled by high-dose
ICS +LABA and had a significant reduction in FEV1.
Five patients had other comorbidities (IgE-mediated
food allergy, EoE, allergic rhinitis and rhinosinusitis).
Two subjects had only severe food allergy.

In the asthmatic patients, therapy with omalizumab
ranged from 16 to 104 weeks, but two subgroups could
be identified: those treated only for allergic asthma
(Group A, N= 3) and those who also had a food allergy
(Group B, N= 3). Omalizumab therapy in the three patients with moderate-severe asthma and concomitant
IgE-mediated CMA was started with the dual purpose of
achieving better asthma control and promoting milk
desensitization.

Patients in Group A had severe allergic asthma not
controlled by standard therapy (GINA STEP 4/5) [33].
All subjects achieved good asthma control after starting
anti-IgE therapy (Table 2). We proceeded to gradually
step down standard therapy, with an ICS minimum reduction of 50% until its complete suspension in two subjects. FEV1 improved at the end of the treatment in all
patients (Table 2).

Subjects in Group B had moderate-severe allergic
asthma partially or not controlled by standard therapy
(GINA STEP 4/5) and food allergy. All subjects achieved
good asthma control that allowed step down of standard
therapy and PFTR improvement.

In two patients in Group B, complete suspension of
standard asthma therapy was possible, despite the omalizumab therapy in this group, administered according to
the oral desensitization protocol, lasting less (16-48
weeks) than in Group A (78-104 weeks) (Tables 2 and 3).
Subjects also suffering from allergic rhinitis experienced
an improvement in nasal symptoms during therapy with
omalizumab, when evaluated by a total score of nasal
symptoms (TNSS) (weekly pre-treatment range 42-10 vs.
post-treatment 29-4). The subject with chronic rhinosinusitis presented a symptomatic improvement (pre-treatment VAS = 5 vs post-treatment VAS = 2).

Five patients suffered from food allergy (3 belonging
to the Group B with asthma comorbidity) and 2 subjects
(Group C) received the anti-IgE assisted OIT for food
allergy.

According to European Guidelines, all patients underwent allergy testing and OFC before starting the
desensitization protocol [43].

Omalizumab-assisted OIT had a variable duration depending on the protocol used and the emergence of adverse reactions. In Group B, two subjects achieved a
maintenance milk dose of 140mL and 180 mL, respectively, showing desensitization continued after omalizumab

discontinuation. However, both subjects presented an anaphylaxis episode after taking milk a few days after a viral
infection, suggesting the role of infectious diseases as a
trigger disrupting desensitization. The third subject suspended the omalizumab-assisted OIT after about 12
months because of anaphylaxis after the administration of
10 mL of milk. However, in this case, adherence to therapy
was not adequate, as regularity of home milk intakes had
not been followed.

In Group C, subjects were successfully desensitized to
milk, but we cannot predict if they will be tolerant lifelong. Furthermore, a reduction of total and specific IgE
(pre vs. post-treatment) was observed in the two subjects
who successfully completed the desensitization protocol.

This report suggests that omalizumab is an excellent
therapeutic option in subjects with severe allergic
asthma that remains uncontrolled despite high-dose ICS
lus other controller medications, as already widely veriied in other studies.

These findings suggest the potential role of omalizumab
to support oral desensitization in patients with IgE mediated
‘ood allergy. It could promote a reduction in adverse immune response to food, along with a lower risk of anaphylaxis and increased quality of life for children and their
milies. However, further studies are needed to confirm
these promising results. Currently, omalizumab is not aproved for the treatment of food allergy. No efficacy was
seen in EoE which has more complex pathogenesis. In
addition, we observed a clinical efficacy in treating allergic
rhinitis and rhinosinusitis. TNSS scores valuating nasal
symptoms (blockage, rhinorrhea, itching and sneezing) in
atients with allergic rhinitis were reduced thus suggesting
the role of omalizumab also on rhinitis-related symptoms.
In conclusion omalizumab represents the pivotal treatament

 

 

option for severe, uncontrolled asthma in childhood. It
could promote an effective treatment of IgE mediated food
allergy,and severe allergic rhinitis. However, large and well
controlled studies are awaited to confirm these promising
results.
