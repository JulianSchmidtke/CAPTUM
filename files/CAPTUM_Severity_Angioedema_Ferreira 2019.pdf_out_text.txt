Abstract

Background: Chronic urticaria is defined as the appearance of urticarial lesions and/or angioedema during a period
of more than six weeks. We aimed at developing the Portuguese version of the Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life
Questionnaire (CU-Q30L) and at testing its reliability and the content, construct and criterion validity.

Methods: The forward-backward approach to a linguistic equivalence was followed, after which a clinical review
and a cognitive debriefing with patients were performed. The intraclass correlation coefficient checked test-retest
reliability with patients filling the same questionnaire with one week apart and the Cronbach’s alpha indicator
assessed the internal consistency. Construct validity was tested by an exploratory factor analysis and by hypothesis
tests involving sociodemographic and clinical patient characteristics, including the urticaria control test (UCT). On
the other hand, criterion validity was tested through correlations with the Short-Form Health Survey SF-36, EQ-5D-5
L, and the Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI).

Results: A total of 162 patients from seven hospital units were included. The mean (standard deviation) age was
42.6 (13.3) and 81.6% were female. CU-Q20L was entirely filled by all respondents. Internal consistency was 0.947 for
the overall score, ranging from 0.661 (limits) to 0.899 (sleep problems) and the corresponding reproducibility
indicator was 0.910, based on 23 patients and ranging from 0.711 (swelling) and 0.957 (looks). Exploratory factor
analysis in general confirmed the original structure originally obtained by the authors. All CU-Q,0L dimensions were
highly correlated with DLQI Index and differentiated well between males and females, and between different levels
of wheals and pruritus. In addition, moderate negative correlations were found between Cu-Q,0L scores and the
dimensions from SF-36 and EQ-5D-5 L.

Conclusions: The satisfactory metric properties confirmed the cultural adaptation and validity of CU-Q,0L into
Portuguese population, providing the clinicians with a valid tool to evaluate the impact of chronic urticaria on
patient’s QoL and therefore adjust their treatment.

Trial registration number: Not applicable.

Background

Every chronic illness produces a significant impact on
patients’ life, affecting both physical and psychosocial
domains. Chronic urticaria (CU) can be defined as the
appearance of urticarial lesions (wheals) and/or angioedema during a period of more than six weeks [1-5].
There are major problems regarding etiology, pathogenic
mechanisms and pharmacological treatment of CU and
its management ultimately aims at preserving the wellbeing and the quality of life of patients.

In fact, chronic urticaria can lead to changes in sleep
patterns, daytime sleepiness, ability to concentrate, altered
perception of self-image, social isolation, psychological
changes and even anxiety and depression [6]. It also yields
relevant direct and indirect costs, including drugs, medical
appointments, emergency visits, hospitalization, absenteeism and presenteeism [7].

Few studies had addressed quality of life (QoL) in patients with chronic urticaria until 2005, when Baiardini
et al. created the Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire (CU-Q,oL) [1], an Italian measure specifically
designed for CU patients to express their perspectives.
Until then the QoL of patients with CU was only measured
through generic health status instruments such as the
Short-Form Health Survey SF-36 [8] or the Nottingham
Health Profile [9].

Although generic instruments can be used in all diseases and populations, enabling an easier comparison of
the impact of health states associated with various clinical conditions, they do not measure the precise burden
of a particular disease, and they may not be enough sensitive to changes in health status. Specific instruments,
on the other hand, are more sensitive to small differences in health and changes overtime, showing higher
‘ace validity, thus better supporting therapeutic decisions. For instance, the dimension ‘looks’ is never
addressed by generic instruments, in spite of being very
meaningful for patients with chronic urticaria. Thereore, the cultural adaptation of the CU-Q,oL to the
Portuguese reality was somehow urgent in order to
know the effective impact of CU in patients and thereore allow providers and researchers to compare their
results with those obtained in different countries and to
articipate in international studies.

There are no specific data for Portugal regarding the
incidence and/or prevalence of chronic urticaria but,
based on international data, it is estimated that CU
affects up to 1% of the Portuguese population at any
given time. Two thirds represent forms of chronic spontaneous urticaria [6, 10, 11], which can have a high impact on consumption of healthcare resources and direct
and indirect costs. According to the single study concerning costs in Portugal, which is on agreement with
international data, the average cost to treat a patient

 

 

Page 2 of 12

with severe chronic spontaneous urticaria is estimated to
be 6234€ over five years, of which 4220€ correspond to
National Health Service direct costs and the remaining
2014€ to out-of-pocket indirect costs [12]. A systematic
implementation of a valid and reliable measure of quality
of life may alert doctors and patients to a timely approach to the impact of the situation.

The aim of this study was to create a valid and reliable
questionnaire in European Portuguese from the original
CU-Q,oL, to measure the quality of life and the burden
experienced by individuals with chronic urticaria. For
this purpose, we (i) linguistically and culturally adapted
the CU-Q,oL from Italian to Portuguese; (ii) assessed reliability, validity, interpretability and acceptance of the
Portuguese version; and (iii) estimated the health-related
quality life of a sample of patients with chronic urticaria.

Methods

Linguistic and cultural adaptation

We followed the internationally defined methodology for
the linguistic and cultural adaptation for the validation
of outcome measures, as well as the author’s methodological proposal. Therefore, after the authors’ permission
for the creation of a Portuguese version of the CU-Q.oL,
we started with the translation of the Italian version to
Portuguese and followed the recommendations proposed
by the COSMIN checklist [13] and by the sequential approach [14].

This phase included the elaboration of two local independent versions from two experienced bilingual Portuguese translators who, based on the original Italian
questionnaire preformed forward translations into Portuguese. Both translations were merged in a reconciled
version drawn up between the translators and the study
team. Another local translator, bilingual Italian native
speaker, a researcher in the University of Coimbra, who
did not have any access to the original Italian version of
the questionnaire, then back translated this merged version. This back-translation was finally compared with
the original version to guarantee a semantic equivalence.

We also asked a clinician to perform a scientific review
of the final translation. This allergy hospital specialist
was asked to look at both versions and comment. Three
alternatives of answers were given to her: (i) if happy
with the translation, it was only required to use a check
sign to say it in the “comments section’; (ii) if terms
should have substantial corrections to add, she should
give a new proposal in the section “suggestions proposed”; and (iii) if assumed that there is more than one
correct form to translate the sentence, she should include her suggestion on the section “possible alternative
for further cognitive test”.

Next, we ran a cognitive debriefing meeting with 10
chronic urticarial patients. Our aim was to detect
Ferreira et al. Health and Quality of Life Outcomes (2019) 17:190

whether the Portuguese version we had was acceptable
by patients and whether its contents was understandable,
no ambiguous, no redundant and easy to fill. This sample of actual patients approximately respected the agegender distribution of the target patient group, with only
one exception: we forced to have patients from the lowest possible education level, as we assumed that if interpretation problems didn’t occur with this type of
patients they won’t occur with patients with higher education level.

At this phase, our main goal was to obtain a conceptual and linguistic version, equivalent to the Italian original. That is, a Portuguese version where the items
would have the same meaning and content as the corresponding items in the original version.

Study design

This was an observational multicenter study aimed at
validating a diagnostic scale and analyzing the healthrelated quality of life of a sample of patients. Dermatologists and imuno allergologists from seven dermatology
and imuno-allergology departments of four Portuguese
public hospitals from the areas of Lisbon, Coimbra and
Oporto conducted the study during regular medical appointments. The National Data Protection Agency and
the Ethics Committees of all hospitals approved the
study and all participants gave their informed consent
after previous information about the objective of this
study, its benefits, potential risks and possible discomfort. There was, under no circumstances, any interference with the health professional decision regarding the
best-suited medical approach to each patient.

Participants
We included consecutive patients from the different
units who (i) had at least 18 years of age, (ii) suffered
from chronic urticaria for at least six months, (iii) had
capacity to give consent to participate in the study, and
(iv) knew how to read, write and understand Portuguese.
Excluded were (i) unstable patients or with uncontrolled
symptoms and perceived by clinicians as not having ability to fill the measures, (ii) cognitively affected patients,
or (iii) who did not understand Portuguese.

After data collection, the information was registered in
a digital device without any identification of patients.
Data was analyzed and hypotheses were tested in
order to demonstrate the reliability and validity of the
Portuguese version of the CU-Q,oL.

Measurement instruments

In this study, health-related quality of life was measured
through specific and generic instruments. Specific
instruments included the Portuguese version of the CUQ,oL and the Dermatology Quality of Life Index

Page 3 of 12

(DLQI). Among the generic instruments we selected the
generic health status measure SF-36 and the health preference quality of life EQ-5D-5 L. Sociodemographic and
clinic data were also collected, including the measurement of the severity of the urticaria and its control by
the Urticaria Control Test (UCT).

e CU-Q,0L is the first disease-specific instrument
designed to measure the quality of life of patients
with chronic urticaria [1]. The authors of the
initial Italian version had the goal to create a selfadministered, easy and fast answering measurement
instrument to be filled without any assistance and to
be able to capture the physical, psychosocial and
practical aspects relevant to patients with chronic
urticaria [ 1]. It was initially created by professionals
and patients and consisted of 37 items with a recall
period of two weeks; the items emerged from experts
and researchers in immunology, dermatology and
immuno-allergology, as well as a panel of 60 patients
affected by CU. It was later reduced to 23 items
corresponding to an overall impairment score and six
dimensions: pruritus, swelling, impact on life activities,
sleep problems, limits, and looks, as follows:

 

Pruritus Sleep problems Looks
1 pruritus 11 ease of falling asleep 19 medication adverse
effects
2 wheals 12 walking up during 20 bothersome
the night
Swelling 13 daytime tiredness 21 embarrassing in

public

3 eyes swelling 14 ability to concentrate 22 use of cosmetics

4 lips swelling 15 nervousness 23 choice of clothes

Impact on life Limits
activities
5 work 16 bad mood

6 physical activities 17 limits in choosing food

7 quality of sleep —- 18 sport
8 free time
9 social relations

10 eating

 

Answering the questionnaire, patients express how
troubled they are, by scoring each item on a 5-point
Likert-type scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). For
each dimension, the corresponding items are summed to
obtain a score, which is converted to a scale from 0 to
100 through a linear transformation. Similar procedure
is applied to an overall score. Higher values always
Ferreira et al. Health and Quality of Life Outcomes (2019) 17:190

correspond to higher QoL impairment, which means
worse QoL [1].

In its original version, this measure showed good values
of convergent validity with SF-36, internal consistency
with Cronbach alpha scores between 0.65 and 0.83, reliability with good Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC)
for four items and greater or equal to 0.75 for the other
items and that is, standards of quality that ensure a good
measuring tool to evaluate the burden in chronic urticaria
patients. It has been translated and adapted in several languages, such as Brazilian-Portuguese [15], German [16],
Greek [17], Israeri [18], Persian [19], Polish [20], Spanish
(21], Thai [22], and Turkish [23].

e DLQI is a dermatology-specific questionnaire with
10 items [24] and assesses six different aspects that
may affect the patients’ QoL: symptoms and feelings,
daily activities, leisure activities, work or school,
personal relationships, and treatment. Higher
scores indicate a greater impairment in QoL [24].
Each of the 10 questions is scored from 0 (not at
all) to 3 (very much) and the overall DLQI score
is calculated by summing up the scores from each
question, resulting in a numeric score between 0
and 30. Higher scores indicate a greater impairment
in QoL. The impact of the DLQI scores on a patient’s
life is as follows: 0 to 1 = no effect; 2 to 5 = small
effect; 6 to 10 = moderate effect; 11 to 20 = very large
effect; 21 to 30 = extremely large effect.

e SF-36, with its 36 items, measures eight major
health dimensions, all of them on a scale of 0-100,
with the extreme anchors corresponding,
respectively, to death and perfect health status
[25, 26]. The effectiveness dimensions are physical
function, role limitations due to physical or
emotional problems, intensity and discomfort
caused by pain, general health, vitality, social
function, and mental health. Higher scores mean
a better perceived health status.

e EQ-5D-5L is a generic QoL instrument consisting
of five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual
activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression)
and a visual analogue scale (VAS) for rating health on
the precise day. Weighted scoring produces an EQ5D-5 L index score [27]. The EuroQoL Group has
approved the Portuguese version as well as the
corresponding value set [28].

e UCT isa patient-reported outcome instrument to
retrospectively assess urticaria control [29]. Each
item has five answer options (scored with 0 to 4
points). Low scores indicate high disease activity and
low disease control. Accordingly, the minimum and
maximum UCT scores are, respectively, 0 and 16,
with 16 points indicating complete disease control.

 

Page 4 of 12

The order of administration for the instruments was the
following: first, we asked patients for clinical information
regarding his/her chronic urticaria, before addressing their
assessment of the urticaria control (UCT); next, we
applied the preference quality of life measure EQ-5D-5L,
followed by the DLQI, the CU-Q,oL and the SF-36; at last,
we asked for sociodemographic variables.

Reliability

To address the reliability, we tested the intertemporal
stability and the internal consistency. The former was
tested using the ICC in a 1-week test-retest design with
no clinical intervention during this week. A score
smaller that 0.5 is considered weak, between 0.5 and
0.75 moderate, between 0.75 and 0.9 good, and larger
than 0.9 excellent [30].

On the other hand, the internal consistency, representing
the homogeneity among the individual items, was tested
using the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, which should have
scores between 0.7 and 0.9 [31].

The following two hypotheses were formulated:

H1: The Portuguese version of the CU-QooL shows
good internal consistency.

H2: The Portuguese version of the CU-Q:o0L shows
good intertemporal stability.

Validity

For a measure to be precise, it is essential that it
measures/evaluates what it is supposed to measure. In
what concerns the validity tests, we addressed the three
strands of content, construct, and criterion (31, 32]. The
content validity, measuring the relevance of the items,
has already been tested through the cognitive interviews
of 10 patients and with the reviews performed by
clinicians during the linguistic and cultural adaptation
phase.

The construct validity addresses the ability of the
instrument to measure theoretical concepts. Following
some authors [31, 32], we used the two major ways to test
the construct validity: structural validity and hypothesis
testing. The structural validity was tested by using
exploratory factor analyses. Hypotheses testing assumes
the formulation of several hypotheses with known groups
stratified by sociodemographic variables (sex, age, family
status, employment status and education level) and some
clinical variables (disease duration, angioedema, type and
severity of urticaria, comorbidities, type of treatment, and
control of urticaria). Student t-test and ANOVA were
used to test the CU-Q:oL scores differences on these
known groups.

The following three hypotheses were formulated:

Hg: Exploratory factor analysis replicates the original
structure of CU-Q,oL.
Ferreira et al. Health and Quality of Life Outcomes (2019) 17:190

Hy: CU-Q,oL is able to discriminate based on sociodemographic variables.

H;: CU-Q,0L is able to discriminate based on clinical
variables.

To test the criterion validity we used bivariate
statistical analyses (Pearson’s r correlation coefficients)
between the dimensions of the Portuguese version of the
CU-Q»oL and other measuring instruments. Correlations less than 0.3, between 0.3 and 0.5, and higher than
0.5 were defined as weak, moderate and strong, respectively [33].

These other instruments included the generic health
status instrument SF-36, the generic quality of life instrument EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L and the dermatologyspecific instrument DLQI. We expected to evidence the
similarities and differences between measured concepts.

The following three hypotheses were formulated:

H,: CU-Q,oL dimensions are correlated with the SF36 dimensions.

Hz: CU-QooL dimensions are correlated with the EQ5D-5 L.

Hg: CU-Q,0L dimensions are correlated with the
DLQI dimensions.

Taking into account that SF-36 is a generic health status
measure, a priori we do not expect to have large correlations with CU-QjoL. On the other hand, some significant
correlations are expected with both EQ-5D-5 L index and
VAS. Finally, because DLQI is a dermatology-specific
questionnaire we expect to have large correlations with
CU-Q,oL.

Statistical analysis

Floor and ceiling effects were checked on overall CUQ,ol score and dimensions. These effects exist whenever
more than 15% of the respondents lie, respectively, in
the lowest and the highest possible score [31, 32].

Results

Linguistic and cultural adaptation

During the forward-backward process, no major differences were found and, due to the layout of this
questionnaire, some minor changes were produced in
the Portuguese version after the comparison between
the backward version and the original. Clinical review
also yielded to minor changes in the Portuguese version. On the other hand, on the cognitive debriefing
meeting, no understandability, ambiguity or redundancy errors were mentioned. Only the wording of
some questions had to be changed in order to have a
more colloquial questions. At the end of this process,
a complete report was send to and approved by the
authors of CU-Q,oL.

Sample and reliability

A total of 162 patients from seven units were
included in this study. Table 1 presents the main
sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.

Mean (standard deviation) age was 42.6 (13.3), 81.6%
were female, 63.1% were married, 70.1% were employed,
and almost 35% had 5 to 9years of education. These
patients suffered from the disease in average for the last
5.6 years (median of 3 years). The main diagnosis was
chronic spontaneous urticaria (83.3%) and the most
frequent comorbidities were allergic rhinitis (26.5%),
drug allergies (19.8%), and thyroid disorders (17.3%). A
total of 81.5% of patients received antihistamines and
22.8% were on omalizumab.

Table 2 shows the distribution of the scores of CUQoL overall and dimensions’ scores, as well as reliability
indicators.

As presented in this table, pruritus has the highest
score and no CU-Q,oL dimension showed ceiling effect.
However, some dimensions showed important floor effect
(e.g., limits and looks), possibly justified by taking into account the sample characteristics. Internal consistency of
the overall score (Hj) was very good (0.947), with a small
exception for the dimension ‘limits’ (0.661), and ICC
showed a high reproducibility power, with a ICC for the
overall score equal to 0.910, ranging from 0.711 (swelling)
and 0.957 (looks) across dimensions.

Validity
Starting by the construct validity, in our case, to test the
structural validity, we opt by performing the exploratory
factor analysis with all the 23 items of the Cu-QooL.
Using a principal component analysis with Varimax rotation with Kaiser normalization, we selected five factors,
corresponding to 73.2% of variance explained. Table 3
presents the major results from this factor analysis.
Looking at the contents of these factors, we observed
that the original two factors ‘pruritus’ and ‘swelling’
appeared merged in one sole factor, and ‘sleep problems’
original factor maintains in this new _ structure.
Regarding the ‘impact on life activities’ factor, two items
did not show together with the original ones, but with
an acceptable rationale. They were the item 7 (quality of
sleep) which followed the other items of the ‘sleep’
factor, as well as item 16 (bad mood), and the item 10
(eating) that appeared in the new factor ‘limits’ together
with the item 17 (limits in choosing food) and the item
23 (choice of clothes). The remaining items formed the
‘looks’ factor also with item 18 (sport). At last, item 22
(use of cosmetics) appeared in the domain ‘impact on
life activities’ instead of in the domain ‘looks’ (H3).
Another way to test the construct validity is to address the
discriminative validations by looking at sociodemographic
and clinical variables. Table 4 shows the different CU-Q,oL

average scores for different sociodemographic and clinical
variables.

Regarding the sociodemographic variables and analyzing
hypothesis Hy, in general, CU-QoL differentiated well between males and females, with females always having
higher QoL impairment. However, it was not able to discriminate based on age or education.

On the other hand, in what concerns clinical variables
and hypothesis Hs, this measurement instrument also
differentiated well between different levels of severity of
pruritus and wheals, with most severe cases scored as
poor health. In addition, the presence of angioedema
and a poor urticarial control were perceived as higher
QoL impairment.

At last, Table 5 presents the correlations between CUQsoL overall and dimensions scores and the measurement of health status (SF-36), quality of life (EQ-5D-5
L), and a dermatology-specific questionnaire (DLQI).

As expected, looking at the correlations between CUQ,oL and SF-36 dimensions (hypothesis H¢), we notice
moderate negative correlations, especially for the overall
CU-QooL scores, for the ‘impact on life activities’ and
‘limits’ dimensions (SF-36 physical dimensions) and for
‘sleep problems’ dimension (SF-36 mental dimensions).
In addition, when CU-Q:0L dimensions are correlated
with both EQ-5D-5L index and VAS (hypothesis Hy),

Table 2 Distribution and reliability scores for CU-Q 0L

we showed moderate and large correlation, especially
with the overall CU-Q,oL and with ‘impact on life activities’ dimension. At last, all CU-Q,oL dimensions are
highly correlated with DLQI index (Hg).

Discussion

Cu-QooL is the first disease-specific measurement instrument to address the impact of chronic urticaria on
QoL. To create the Portuguese version we have followed
strict methodologies based on forward-backward translations, with content, construct and criterion validity, as
well as reliability tests.

The sample used to validate this version was formed
by 162 chronic urticaria patients from seven centers
dealing with urticaria patients from the main regions of
Portugal, assuring good country coverage. Among them,
23 patients participated in a test stability over time. The
sample with a mean age of 42.6 and female predominance
reflects the characteristics of the population attending the
chronic urticaria clinics, including in Portugal [34, 35]. All
patients considered the Portuguese version understandable
and without ambiguity.

Excellent reliability scores were found when performing
the internal consistency and when over time stability was
tested, even a little bit better than in other countries
{15, 16, 20-23]. Some variability may be accepted due

to the frequent changing of the disease activity over
days/weeks and, consequently, with some variability in
the interference on some aspects of the QoL.
Exploratory factor analysis revealed a very similar
structure comparable with the one presented by the
authors on its original version and explaining 73.2% of
the variance. The major discrepancy between the Italian
and the Portuguese CU-Q:oL factor structures resides
on the fact that ‘pruritus’ and ‘swelling’ domains did not
appear as two individual domains, encompassing a
‘symptoms’ domain. However, when comparing the
structure proposed by the original authors and by the
various countries’ culturally adapted versions, we also
evidence some differences. In fact, while the Spanish
(21] and the Turkish [23] versions retain the original
scales, the German [16], the Greek [17], the Hebrew [18]
and the Polish [20] versions show new six-scale structures, including dimensions as ‘functioning’ and ‘mental
status’. Brazilian [15] version determined a three-scale
structure formed by ‘sleep/mental status/eating’, ‘pruritus/impact on life activities’, and ‘swelling/limits/look’.”
Construct validity known-groups tests also revealed
the power of CU-Q:0L to be able to discriminate patients based on sociodemographic, namely with a higher

impact on QoL in the female population which is usually
described in other studies [1, 15, 16, 20, 22, 23], and certainly has to do with higher levels of pruritus and angioedema reported in this group of females (respectively
42.5 and 17.8, compared to 33.6 and 8.2 in males).

The item ‘looks’, encompasses particularly embarrassing
situations in public, use of cosmetics and choice of
clothes, has shown to have a more significant impact on
women and may have contributed significantly for the
difference of the burden of CU between genders. In
addition, when evaluated by another instrument, the
DLAQI, the impact of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU),
as well as psoriasis and other chronic skin diseases is also
significantly higher in females.

Clinical variables associated with more severe disease
were clearly correlated with a higher score in CU-Q,oL.
Severity of pruritus and the number of wheals in the
previous week, which together constitute one of the
scores more frequently used to asses disease severity in
Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU) (the UAS7 — urticaria activity score 7), as well as angioedema with unpredictable swellings that often occurs in exposed areas and
that may affect functional activities of patient and his life
within the society (speech, visual capacity, eating, walking

t: Student's t (2 alternatives); F: Fisher's F (3 or more alternatives)

or manual tasks) were very significantly correlated with
CU-Q.oL, as we might expect. Also, within the same
sense, the study showed very good correlation between
the score of the Cu-Q,oL and the UCT, that addresses
questions like how severe were the symptoms and signs of
CU (pruritus, wheals and swellings), how CU has interfered with the patient’s life, how much the treatment was
able/unable to control the symptoms of CU, although
UCT goes back to the previous four weeks [29].

The lack of effect of age and education on patients’
answers make us ensure that this measurement instrument
may be used irrespective of these sociodemographic
variables and that the burden of CSU is transversal to all
ages and levels of education.

Comparisons between CU-Q,oL with the scores from
DLQI, SF-36 and EQ-5D-5 L in the same population of
Portuguese patients showed expected results with very
good correlations between similar aspects evaluated by

these different PROs further strengthening the validity
of the measure obtained by the Portuguese version CUQooL.

Also, in this study we could confirm that Portuguese
results with the CU-Q:oL were in line with the results
obtained by the original and the different versions translated in different languages and used in different populations [15-23], therefore confirming that the burden of
CSU and its detrimental effect on the patients’ QoL is
transversal to all populations of the world were these
studies have been performed.

The possible limitation we may have in this study is
the sample size. Therefore, we plan to pursue the
implementation of the Portuguese version of the CUQoL in regular medical appointments and, later, with a
larger sample, to perform a confirmatory factor analysis
to test the replication of the major findings.

Conclusion

Our study showed that the Portuguese version of the
CU-Q,0L is semantically and culturally equivalent to the
original Italian version. The good performance of the
scale adapted into Portuguese, its short administration
time and highly cost-effective administration make the
Cu-Q,o0L a valid, reliable and useful tool for research
and standard clinical practice.
