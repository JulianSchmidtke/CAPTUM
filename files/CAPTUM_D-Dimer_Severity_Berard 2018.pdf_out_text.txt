Summary

Background Omalizumab is approved as an add-on therapy for the treatment of
chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in patients with inadequate response to H1antihistamine treatment. The urticaria control test (UCT) is a reliable, concise
tool developed as an alternative to the 7-day urticaria activity score (UAS7) — the
standard for CSU disease activity assessment.

Objectives This prospective, open-label, phase IV study evaluated the efficacy and
safety of omalizumab in French adult patients with CSU nonresponsive to H1antihistamine treatment.

Materials and

methods Patients [n= 136; stratified 1:2 (with

: without angioedema)] received omalizumab 300 mg subcutaneously

angiooedema
every 4 weeks for 12 weeks. Study assessments included UCT, UAS7, angiooedema activity score and p-dimer levels (exploratory objective).

Results At Week 12, 74-6% of the patients achieved disease control [UCT score > 12
(primary endpoint)] and 67:7% of patients showed well-controlled disease
(UAS7 < 6). There was a strong negative correlation between UCT score and UAS7
at Week 12 (Spearman’s correlation coefficient —0-839). Mean plasma p-dimer concentration was elevated at baseline (1002-1 ng mL~') and decreased notably at
Week 8 (455 ng mL~'). Among the nine patients with a very high baseline p-dimer
concentration (> 3000 ng mL~'), eight were responders (UAS7 < 6) at Week 12.
Conclusions Omalizumab was efficacious in patients with CSU nonresponsive to

 

H1-antihistamines. The UCT was a reliable tool for disease assessment and the
scores correlated well with UAS7. This study does not support the usefulness of
p-dimer to monitor long-term disease prognosis in adult urticaria; however, it

may indicate patients who respond to omalizumab.

Omalizumab in patients with antihistamine-resistant CSU, Bérard et al. 57

 

The urticaria control test (UCT) is a recently validated tool for disease control
assessment in patients with CSU.

Elevated plasma levels of p-dimer observed in some patients with CSU suggests a
potential role of p-dimer as a biomarker in CSU treatment response and prognosis.

This study does not support the usefulness of p-dimer to monitor long-term disease prognosis in adult urticaria; however, it may indicate patients who respond to

omalizumab.

 

 

 

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is characterized by the
spontaneous occurrence of transient, itchy recurrent weals that
persist for at least 6 weeks, with or without angioedema.'
CSU has an estimated point prevalence of approximately 0-5—
1%.* Its etiology and pathogenesis has not been completely
understood and several causative factors, including autoimmune processes, have been hypothesized.** Recent evidence
suggests a possible involvement of the coagulation cascade in
the pathogenesis of CSU as elevated plasma levels of thrombin
and p-dimer were observed in some patients.” ”

CSU is a debilitating disease that can severely impact patients’
quality of life (QoL).*” International guidelines recommend second-generation H1-antihistamines at licensed doses as first-line
therapy and to progressively increase the dosage up to fourfold,
in case of nonresponse.'° However, in about 10% of patients,
H1-antihistamines fail to achieve symptom control even at higher
doses and the patient requires additional medication.” Omalizumab, a humanized anti-immunoglobulin E (anti-IgE) monoclonal antibody, is recommended as the third-line treatment for
CSU, as an add-on to H1-antihistamines. Omalizumab binds to
the Fc region of free IgE and prevents it from binding to its highaffinity receptor (FceR1) on mast cells and basophils.'! The safety
and efficacy of omalizumab in the treatment of CSU were established in three phase III studies in patients with H1-antihistamine-refractory moderate-to-severe CSU. earl

In these pivotal studies, disease activity was assessed using
the 7-day urticaria activity score (UAS7) as recommended by
international guidelines.'° The UAS7 is a unified and simple
score that combines daily weal count and pruritus intensity.
Although UAS7 is a useful and widely used tool, it has some
limitations in that it is prospective, does not cover angiooedema and is difficult to evaluate if the patient forgets to
complete the diary on a daily basis.'°

Hence, the urticaria control test (UCT), a reliable and brief
tool, was developed to overcome the limitations of UAS7. The
UCT is the first validated and reliable patient-reported outcome (PRO) tool that retrospectively measures disease control

in patients with all types of chronic urticaria and through its

© 2018 British Association of Dermatologists

clear threshold of > 12 for well-controlled disease helps treatment decisions. Unlike UAS7, UCT has a 4-week recall period
and is independent of any previous patient presentations.'*
The SUNRISE study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy
of subcutaneous (s.c.) omalizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks in
French adult patients with CSU who had an inadequate
response to H1-antihistamine treatment. The recently validated
UCT was used to assess disease activity for the first time in
this prospective clinical study. Additionally, the present study
explored the relation between plasma p-dimer concentrations

and disease activity in patients with CSU.

Materials and methods

Study design and participants

SUNRISE (trial registration: EudraCT no. 2014-005424-97) was a
prospective, open-label, single-arm, nonrandomized, multicentre
(30 centres), phase IV study conducted in France. The study comprised a screening period, a 12-week treatment period and an
extension period (Fig. 1). Patients included in the study were
aged between 18 and 75 years and met all the following criteria
prior to enrolment: a diagnosis of CSU for > 6 months with an
inadequate response to nonsedating H1-antihistamines as evidenced by the presence of hives associated with itching for at
least six consecutive weeks at any time before enrolment despite
current use of H1-antihistamines; a UAS7 > 16 (equivalent to
moderate-to-severe CSU symptoms) and a UCT score < 8. Exclusion criteria included body weight < 40 kg (minimum age at
inclusion, 18 years); a clearly defined underlying cause for
chronic urticaria (e.g. physical urticaria); use of any H2-antihistamine or leukotriene receptor antagonist within 7 days preceding
the screening; presence of other diseases with similar signs of
urticaria or angioedema; evidence of parasitic infection and concomitant use of ciclosporin or any other immunosuppressive
agent within 30 days prior to screening. The detailed exclusion
criteria and the list of prohibited medications are provided in

Supplementary Appendix $1 (see Supporting Information).

Enrolled patients were stratified 1:2 (with

without angioedema) to represent general CSU epi
angiooedema :
demiology. All patients received three s.c. injections of omalizumab 300 mg (two injections of 150 mg each in the
deltoid region of the left and right arm or in the thigh) at 4week intervals at the study centre. Patients who had an adequate response to omalizumab at Week 12 (defined as
UCT = 8 or a UAS7 < 16 at 12 weeks or an improvement
> 10 points on the UAS7 between baseline and 12 weeks)
were allowed to continue treatment during the extension period (up to commercial availability of omalizumab in France: 3
Nov 2015).

All patients provided written informed consent. The study
protocol and all amendments were reviewed and approved by an
Independent Ethics Committee. The study was conducted

according to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Study objectives

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the proportion of patients with a UCT score > 12 (indicating a well-controlled urticaria) at Week 12. The secondary and exploratory
objectives have been described in Supplementary Appendix $2
(see Supporting Information).

Study assessments

All the PRO tools used by the patients were available in a
French version. The use of the available French version of the
UCT was permitted with fees to Moxie GmbH, Berlin, Germany, owners of the rights, for this study. The UCT was completed by the patients at baseline and prior to administration of
the study drug at Weeks 4, 8 and 12. The UCT score was

derived from four questions, each with five answer options

British Journal of Dermatology (2019) 180, pp56-66

(scored 0-4 points), where low points indicated high disease
activity and poor disease control (see Supplementary
Appendix $3, Supporting Information, for the UCT questionnaire). The minimum and maximum UCT scores were 0 and
16, respectively, with 16 indicating complete disease control.
Patients completed a diary that covered the UAS7 and angioedema activity score (AAS; in case of angioedema), once daily.
The diary was given to patients on Day —7, and complete diary
information was collected for the seven consecutive days prior
to the baseline visit and at Weeks 4, 8 and 12. The QoL assessments were performed at baseline and prior to administration
of the study drug at Weeks 4, 8 and 12. See Supplementary
Appendix $4 for details on UAS7, AAS, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), chronic urticaria QoL (CU-QoL) and angioedema QoL (AE-QoL) assessments; see Supporting Information.

The p-dimer concentration was determined at baseline and
Weeks 4 and 8. Blood levels of prothrombin factors 1 and 2,
hypersensitive C-reactive protein, and factors Va and XIla
were also assessed. Safety assessments consisted of collecting
all adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs along with their
severity and relationship to the study drug.

Statistical analysis

The sample size was based on the proportion of patients with
a UCT score = 12 for the full analysis set (FAS), assuming a
mean UCT score of 14 with a SD of 3, which corresponds to
an expected true proportion of 74-8% of patients achieving
disease control at 12 weeks. Based on a 95% confidence interval (CI), 110 patients were needed to achieve a disease control
success rate in the 66-6-82-9% range. Based on an assumption
that 10% of patients would not contribute values to the primary evaluation, 126 patients were planned to be enrolled. All

efficacy analyses were performed using a two-sided test at 5%

significance level. The primary analysis variable was the pro
portion of patients disease control (UCT

score > 12).

The proportion of patients achieving disease control at

achieving

Week 12 was calculated and presented with corresponding
95% CIs using the Clopper-Pearson method (exact binomial).
Success of disease control was considered to have been
achieved if the observed proportion of patients achieving disease control at Week 12 fell within the 66-6-82-9% range.
Missing UCT scores at Week 12 were imputed using the lastobservation-carried-forward method. The correlation between
p-dimer concentration at baseline and the UCT score and
UAS7 at Week 8 was presented using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and scatter plots. The FAS, which included all
patients who provided signed informed consent and received
at least one dose of omalizumab, was used to analyse the effi
cacy and safety data.

Results

Of the 156 patients screened, 136 were enrolled and received
at least one dose of omalizumab; 124 patients completed the
core period of 12 weeks, and 12 patients discontinued the

study (Fig. 2). The most common reason for discontinuation

 

was protocol deviation (n = 6, 4:4%, Fig. 2). The mean (+
SD) age of the study population was 44-4 + 12-7 years and
women comprised 77-9% of this population (Table 1). The
median (range) number of previous CSU medications was 2-0
(1-5) (Table 2); the most frequent were H1-antihistamines
and antileukotrienes. During the study, 50-7% of patients used
at least one concomitant medication for CSU. The most common category of concomitant medications (taken by 59-6% of

patients) was second-generation antihistamines (Table 3).

Quality of life

There was a notable improvement in the Qol of patients with
CSU after 12 weeks of omalizumab treatment. Although
patients with angioedema had higher CU-QoL and DLQI
scores at baseline than those without angioedema, the
improvement in scores was similar in both groups at Week 12
(Table 4) after treatment with omalizumab. The UCT score
was negatively correlated with CU-QoL and DLQI scores at
Week 12 (Table 5).

Angioedema-related assessments

In patients with angioedema, the total AE-QoL score
decreased and the AAS improved from baseline to Week 12
with omalizumab (both P < 0-0001; Table 4). The UCT score
was negatively correlated with AE-QoL and AAS at Week 12

(Table 5).

Safety

The mean duration of exposure to omalizumab during the

 

core treatment period was 11-93 + 1-72 (range 4-1—-14-1)
weeks. Most patients (93-4%) received a total of three
injections as the approved dose of 300 mg was administered s.c. every 4 weeks over a period of 3 months, and
the mean cumulative dose was 869-12 + 122-63 mg. The
mean duration of exposure to omalizumab was
19-11 + 5-46 (range 4:1—29-1) weeks from baseline up to
the end of the study. No death or episode of anaphylactic

shock were reported during the study. A total of five

Discussion

The results of the SUNRISE study confirm the efficacy of omalizumab 300 mg s.c. in controlling the symptoms and in
improving the QoL in French patients with moderate-to-severe
CSU nonresponsive to Hl-antihistamine treatment. Indeed,
two-thirds of our patients achieved a UAS7 < 6 at Week 12 of
omalizumab treatment, indicative of well-controlled disease,

which is comparable with the data observed in the three pivotal studies (52-66% of patients with a UAS7 < 6).'* '*
SUNRISE is the first prospective study that investigated the
utility of the UCT in patients with CSU treated with omalizumab. Overall, 74-6% of patients in our study achieved a
UCT score > 12 with omalizumab treatment. Our results confirm that the UCT is a reliable tool to measure disease control,
consistent with the findings from a previous study from Thailand in 169 patients with chronic urticaria.'* Urticaria symptoms vary greatly from one day to another, and the disease

condition at the time of presentation to the physician is rarely

representative of actual disease status.'” Therefore, it is important to have retrospective, easy-to-use PRO tools such as the
UCT.

Taken together, the UAS7 and UCT scores confirm the efficacy of omalizumab in these patients with moderate-to-severe
CSU nonresponsive to H1-antihistamines. Interestingly, a significant negative correlation was observed between the UCT
score and UAS7, with a consistent variation between the two
scores in a majority of patients, reinforcing the correlation
between the two.

Another interesting finding is that omalizumab was equally
efficacious in patients with or without angioedema as shown
by the comparable change in UCT score and UAS7 in both
groups at Week 12. Angioedema is fairly common in patients
with CSU (33-67%); it adversely affects the patient’s QoL and
is also associated with increased disease duration and worse
prognosis.” In the present study, 61% of patients had angioedema at baseline with an increased AE-QoL total score, which
significantly decreased at Week 12 along with the AAS. These
results are in line with the findings of the X-ACT study, which
showed the efficacy of omalizumab in patients with moderate
to-severe CSU symptoms and angioedema nonresponsive to

high doses of antihistamine treatment.!” In addition, as
expected, our patients had a severe QoL impairment at baseline as evidenced by the high CU-QoL, DLQI and AE-QoL
scores. Treatment with omalizumab for 12 weeks resulted in a
significant improvement of all QoL scores. Moreover, these
scores negatively correlated with the UCT scores, further confirming the reliability of the UCT. Overall, these results from
the SUNRISE study suggest that UCT can be used as an alternative to UAS7, for example, in new patients or in those who
did not fill in their UAS7 before the consultation and in
patients with angioedema whose disease activity cannot be
measured by UAS7.

Several pathways have been suggested to explain omalizumab’s mechanism of action in urticaria; however, the
mechanism is not yet fully understood. The major effect of

omalizumab in patients with CSU is considered to result from

the downregulation of high-affinity IgE receptors on mast cells
and basophils, leading to a reduction in the release of inflammatory mediators from these cells.°?' The 2017 study by
Deza et al. demonstrated downregulation of FceRI, a high-affinity IgE receptor, with omalizumab treatment.”” Other effects,
including those on the coagulation cascade leading to a
marked reduction in p-dimer plasma levels, have also been
suggested.”"7? Furthermore, high p-dimer levels have been
found to be associated with poor response to antihistamines
and ciclosporin in patients with CSU.”

Recently, Asero et al. observed elevated baseline p-dimer
levels in 59% of patients with severe CSU, and a dramatic
decrease in the levels in some patients who responded to
omalizumab treatment, suggesting a possible effect of omalizumab on coagulation activation and fibrin degradation in a
subset of patients with CSU.’ Consistent with the published
literature, elevated baseline p-dimer levels were observed in
patients from the SUNRISE study. A fast normalization in
plasma p-dimer levels was observed with omalizumab as early
as Week 4, with a further decrease until Week 8. There was
no meaningful correlation between Week 12 UCT or UAS7
scores and baseline p-dimer concentrations. However, in a
small subset of patients (10 of 136) with very high baseline
p-dimer levels (> 3000 ng mL™'), most had disease control at
Week 12. Future studies may help us to better understand the
link between p-dimer and clinical response with omalizumab.

This study has some limitations including its open-label nature and lack of a control group. Although H1-antihistamine
treatment was to be at a stable dose for the duration of the
treatment period per protocol, patients had the option to
decrease the dosage if needed. As any change in dose was not
actively monitored, we cannot conclude on the adaptation of
the Hl-antihistamine following improvement in urticaria.
Moreover, the study was conducted only in France, possibly
limiting the generalizability of the results. Overall, these data
further confirm the efficacy of omalizumab in patients with
CSU with inadequate response to H1-antihistamine treatment
and highlight the reliability of the UCT as a disease control
tool in these patients. Omalizumab was well tolerated, and the
safety results were consistent with the established safety profile.

The use of the UCT should be recommended in routine
clinical practice in order to assess efficacy and response to any
urticaria treatment. Results demonstrate that p-dimers are elevated in some patients and change in response to treatment.
This study does not support the usefulness of p-dimer as a
marker of disease activity in adult urticaria; however, it may
represent a useful tool to indicate patients who respond to

omalizumab.
