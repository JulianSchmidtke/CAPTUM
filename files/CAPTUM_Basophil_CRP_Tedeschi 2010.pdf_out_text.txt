Summary

Background Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is an endopeptidase produced by many
inflammatory cells that has been found in increased amounts in plasma from patients with
chronic urticaria (CU).

Objective To evaluate plasma levels of MMP-9 and its tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1
(TIMP-1) in CU patients in relation with disease severity, C-reactive protein (CRP) and
circulating histamine-releasing factors.

Methods Fifty-two consecutive CU patients were included in the study and disease activity
was graded from 0 to 3. Plasma MMP-9, TIMP-1 and CRP levels were measured by enzyme
immunoassays. Circulating histamine-releasing factors were assessed using in vivo
(autologous serum skin test) and in vitro (basophil histamine release) tests. Seven CU patients
were studied both during active disease and during remission. Thirty healthy subjects were
used as normal controls.

Results Plasma levels of MMP-9, TIMP-1 and CRP were significantly higher in CU patients
than in healthy controls (P= 0.0001, 0.003 and 0.005, respectively) and a trend towards a
higher MMP-9/TIMP-1 molar ratio was found (P= 0.051). A significant correlation was found
between plasma MMP-9 levels and urticaria severity score (r= 0.48, P<0.0001). CRP levels
correlated with MMP-9 levels (r= 0.37, P=0.008) and CU severity score (r= 0.52, P= 0.0001),
but not with TIMP-1 (r=0.13) concentrations. MMP-9, TIMP-1 and CRP plasma levels and
MMP-9/TIMP-1 molar ratio did not differ in patients either with or without an evidence of
circulating histamine-releasing factors. Seven patients evaluated during remission showed a
significant reduction of MMP-9 and CRP plasma levels.
Conclusion Plasma levels of MMP-9 and its inhibitor TIMP-1 are increased in CU patients.
MMP-9 levels are associated with disease severity and CRP levels, but not with skin reactivity
to autologous serum and with circulating histamine-releasing factors. These findings suggest
that in CU there is an ongoing inflammatory process independent of the presence of
circulating histamine-releasing factors.

Introduction

Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9, gelatinase B) is a

zinc-dependent endopeptidase,

tissue remodelling and degradation of the extracellular

matrix [1, 2]. It is secreted as a 92kDa zymogen (proMMP), which is activated by a variety of proteinases
and inhibited by specific tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and by «2-macroglobulin [3, 4].
Increased plasma levels of MMP-9 have been found in

that is responsible for the

patients with chronic urticaria (CU) and have been shown
to be associated with the disease severity [5]. The main
cellular source of MMP-9 in CU has not been defined, but
it has been suggested that it could be derived at least in
part by degranulating mast cells. In fact, according to
Kessel et al. [5], the correlation between urticaria severity
and the circulating MMP-9 suggests a relationship between MMP-9 levels and cutaneous mast cell degranulation. In vitro experiments have shown that human mast
cells derived from peripheral blood can release MMP-9 on
contact with activated T cells and a similar mechanism
might be operating in CU [6]. The sites of wealing in CU
patients are characterized by a perivascular infiltrate of
lymphocytes (mainly of the CD4* type), monocytes,
neutrophils and eosinophils recalling the late-phase antigen-induced reaction [7-10]. It has been hypothesized
that activated CD4* T cells might reside in close proximity
to mast cells and induce mast cell degranulation by
cell-cell contact thus contributing to the appearance of
urticaria symptoms. In the last two decades, it has been
demonstrated that CU is often an autoimmune disorder
due to histamine-releasing autoantibodies, namely autoantibodies directed against the o-subunit of the highaffinity IgE receptor or against IgE [11, 12]. However,
histamine-releasing autoantibodies can be detected in
about 30-50% of CU patients, and the mechanism operating in the other cases still has to be defined [13]. Direct
stimulation by activated T cells might be an alternative
mechanism of mast cell degranulation independent of the
presence of histamine-releasing autoantibodies [6, 14].
The aim of this study was to evaluate MMP-9 and
TIMP-1 levels in a population of CU patients in relation
to the presence of circulating histamine-releasing factors,
as assessed in vivo by autologous serum skin test (ASST)
and in vitro by basophil histamine release assay (BHR),
and to C-reactive protein (CRP) plasma concentrations.

Subjects and methods

Subjects

Fifty-two consecutive patients with chronic ordinary
urticaria (CU) (14 males and 38 females, mean age 42.7
years) were evaluated at the allergy centres of Ospedale
Maggiore Policlinico of Milano and Clinica S. Carlo,
Paderno Dugnano, Italy, and selected for the study. CU
was diagnosed on the basis of the recurrence of spontaneous weals with or without angioedema for >6 weeks.
Patients with physical urticaria were excluded. All
patients had active urticaria at the time of the study.
Disease activity was estimated according to the number
of weals present at the time when blood samples from
these 52 patients were collected, as described previously
by Sabroe et al. [15]: 1-10 small (<3cm in diameter)
weals = grade 1 (mild); 10-50 small weals or 1-10 large

weals = grade 2 (moderate); and > 50 small weals or > 10
large weals = grade 3 (severe). An intradermal test with
0.05 mL of fresh autologous serum (ASST) was carried out
at least 5 days after stopping the antihistamine therapy
(cetirizine, levocetirizine, loratadine, desloratadine or
fexofenadine in all cases). ASST was performed following
the method by Sabroe et al. [16], reading the weal and
flare reaction at 30 min. Intradermal injection of saline
solution (0.9% weight/volume NaCl) was performed as a
negative control and skin prick test with 10mg/mL
histamine as positive control. Patients showing a red weal
with a diameter at least 1.5mm greater than the control
saline solution were considered positive.

At the time of blood sampling, none of the patients had
associated chronic inflammatory disorders, hepatitis C or
an history of recent acute infectious disease. In seven
patients, blood samples were taken during active disease
and during remission. All subjects participating in the
study gave their informed consent to ASST and peripheral
blood collection for BHR, MMP-9, TIMP1 and CRP determinations. Thirty healthy subjects (12 males and 18
females, mean age 42.3 years) served as a control group
for serum and plasma measurements. The study was
approved by the local Institutional Review Board.

Matrix metalloproteinase-9 and tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinase-1 determinations

Blood samples for MMP-9 and TIMP-1 determinations
were collected using heparin as an anticoagulant and were
centrifuged (15min at 1200g) within 30min after removal. The samples were then stored at —20°C until
assayed. MMP-9 concentration was measured using a
sandwich enzyme immunoassay manufactured by R&D
Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA) using two monoclonal
and polyclonal antibodies specific for MMP-9. The sensitivity of the assay is 0.156ng/mL. Plasma TIMP-1 concentration was measured using a sandwich enzyme
immunoassay manufactured by R&D Systems. The assay
used a solid-phase bound monoclonal antibody specific
for TIMP-1 and an enzyme-linked polyclonal antibody
specific for TIMP-1; the sensitivity is 0.156ng/mL. The
intra- and inter-assay variability was lower than 10% for
both MMP-9 and TIMP-1 methods. The molar ratio
between MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels was calculated for
each patient assuming a molecular weight of 92 kDa for
MMP-9 and 28 kDa for TIMP-1.

C-reactive protein determination

CRP plasma concentration was measured using a sandwich enzyme immunoassay (Zymutest CRP, Hyphen
BioMed, Neuville-sur-Oise, France). Intra- and inter-assay
variability was lower than 11%.

Basophil histamine release assay

Leucocyte suspensions from normal blood donors were
prepared by dextran sedimentation of peripheral venous
blood, anticoagulated with 0.01 mM EDTA and mixed with
6% dextran in saline solution (Plander 70, Fresenius Kabi
Italia, Isola della Scala, Verona, Italy) and 30 mm dextrose
(Sigma Chemicals, St Louis, MO, USA). The cells were
allowed to settle for 60-90 min at room temperature,
according to Lichtenstein and Osler [17]. The leucocyterich plasma was aspirated and centrifuged at 300g for
15min at 4°C, and the cell button was washed twice in
Tyrode's buffer, pH 7.4, containing (mm) 140 NaCl, 5.5
dextrose, 2.7 KCI, 0.36 NaH,PO, and 12 NaHCO3. Leucocytes (with about 7 x 10* basophils) were then resuspended
in 100 uL volume of Tyrode’s buffer with 1.8 mm CaCl, and
0.5mm MgCl, and incubated with 100uL of the serum
under examination, making a final volume of 200 uL.
After incubation for 40min at 37°C, the reaction was
stopped by the addition of 800uL of ice-cold buffer
solution and centrifugation at 1000g for 10 min at 4°C.
After centrifugation, the supernatants were aspirated,
mixed with an equal volume of 6% HCI0, and centrifuged
at 1000 g for 10 min at 4°C. Histamine concentration in
the supernatants was measured by an automated fluorometric method, according to Ruff et al. [18] Spontaneous
histamine release was evaluated by measuring the histamine concentration in the supernatant of unstimulated
cells, incubated for 40min at 37°C. Total histamine
content was obtained by adding 100 uL of 6% HClO, to
100 pL of cell suspension. Net histamine release was
calculated as a percentage of total histamine content, after
the subtraction of spontaneous release. A 5% release cutoff value was used, as described previously [19]. Sera were
tested with leucocyte suspensions from three normal
donors whose basophils were shown previously to release
30% of the total histamine content on challenge with an
optimal dose of goat polyclonal anti-human IgE (10 pg/
mL, Sigma Chemicals). In order to detect the presence of
functionally active anti-FceRI autoantibodies, basophil
histamine release was also evaluated after the stripping
of membrane-bound IgE with 10mmol/L lactic acid
(pH 3.9, incubation for 3.5 min at room temperature), a
procedure that allows dissociation of FceRI-bound IgE
without damaging basophil functional activity [20]. One
assay per serum was performed to detect the histaminereleasing activity. Histamine-release assay was carried out
using the same sera used for ASST.

 

Statistical analysis

 

Results were expressed as mean+SEM and were logtransformed before analysis because they were positively
skewed. Differences between means were assessed by
Student’s t-test for unpaired values, and correlation was

assessed by the Pearson’s test. The correlation with urticaria clinical score was assessed by the Spearman’s rank
test. P-values lower than 0.05 were considered significant.

Results

Plasma levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were higher in CU
patients than in healthy controls (mean+SEM: 51.9+7.5
vs. 23.3+1.9ng/mL, P=0.0001 and 63.9+2.7 vs.
52.8+1.9 ng/mL, P=0.003, respectively) (Figs 1 and 2).
MMP-9/TIMP-1 molar ratio was higher in patients than in
controls, although the difference did not reach statistical
significance (0.24+0.03 vs. 0.16+0.03, P=0.051) (Fig. 3).
MMP-9 levels paralleled the severity of CU, and a significant correlation was found between plasma concentrations and the clinical score (r=0.48, P<0.0001) (Fig.
4). Also, MMP-9/TIMP-1 molar ratio was associated with
urticaria severity (r= 0.34, P=0.011). TIMP-1 levels were
not associated with disease severity (r=0.18, P, NS), and
no significant differences were found between patients
with different degrees of urticaria severity. Because of the
limited sample supply, CRP plasma levels were determined
in 50 of 52 CU patients and were significantly higher than
those found in healthy controls (2.98+0.68 pg/mL, range
0.21-18.66 vs. 0.7140.8 g/mL, range 0.10-1.60 pg/mL,
P=0.005). A significant correlation was found between
MMP-9 and CRP plasma levels (r=0.37, P=0.008), but
not between TIMP-1 and CRP plasma levels (r=0.13, P,
NS). CRP levels were also associated with CU severity
(r=0.52, P<0.0001).

In the seven patients observed during CU exacerbation
and during remission, MMP-9 and CRP plasma levels
significantly decreased during remission (MMP-9 from

basophil-bound IgE; however, an increase in histamine
release after stripping of membrane-bound IgE was found
in three patients who already tested weakly positive (from
5.8640.46 to 12.56+2.79%). None of the sera from the 30
healthy subjects caused histamine release above 5% of
total histamine content (maximum release 3.1%). MMP-9,
TIMP-1 and CRP plasma levels as well as MMP-9/TIMP- 1
molar ratio were not significantly different in BHRpositive and BHR-negative patients (Table 2). In BHRpositive patients, no significant correlation was found
between percentage of histamine release and urticaria
severity score, MMP-9 levels or TIMP-1 levels.

 

 

 

Discussion

The present study shows that plasma levels of MMP-9 and
TIMP-1 are significantly higher in CU patients than in
normal subjects. MMP-9 levels as well as MMP-9/TIMP
molar ratio paralleled the severity of CU, and a significan
correlation was found between plasma concentrations and
clinical score. In contrast, TIMP-1 levels were not associated with disease severity and no significant differences
were found between patients with different degrees o
urticaria severity. Although plasma levels of both MMP-9
and TIMP-1 are elevated in CU patients, it appears that the
former is increased to a greater extent than the latter,
suggesting that the increased release of MMP-9 in CU
patients is not balanced by an adequate release of the
natural inhibitor TIMP-1. Accordingly, the MMP-9/TIMP-1
molar ratio was higher in CU patients than in norma
subjects, but the difference was not statistically significant. These findings are in agreement with the observations of Kessel et al. [5], who found increased plasma

levels of MMP-9 in CU patients and observed a good
correlation with the clinical severity score. Antiga et al.
[21] found increased MMP-9 plasma levels in patients
with chronic autoimmune urticaria (i.e. with positive
ASST), but not in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria
(ie. with negative ASST). While confirming the higher
plasma levels of MMP-9 in CU patients when compared
with healthy controls, Altrichter et al. [22] failed to find a
positive correlation with disease activity, although a slight
and not significant tendency to higher MMP-9 levels in
patients with more severe disease was observed. Interestingly, these authors found higher plasma MMP-9 levels in
CU patients with elevated CRP serum levels than in CU
patients with normal CRP serum concentrations. Furthermore, Altrichter et al. [22] observed no significant difference between ASST-positive and ASST-negative patients
regarding plasma MMP-9 levels, in agreement with our
findings. The results of our study also indicate that CU
patients have raised CRP plasma levels that correlate with
disease severity, but not with the presence of circulating
histamine-releasing factors. In fact, CRP plasma levels
were not significantly different in subsets of CU patients

testing positive or negative on ASST and BHR. Indeed, CU
is associated with an increase in an inflammatory biomarker as CRP independently from the presence of detectable
circulating histamine-releasing factors. Also, MMP-9
plasma levels were found to correlate with the severity
score and CRP plasma levels, but not with the presence of
histamine-releasing factors, as assessed by ASST and
BHR. Interestingly, in the seven CU patients evaluated
during activity and remission, both MMP-9 and CRP
plasma levels significantly decreased during remission. It
is conceivable that the elevated MMP-9 plasma levels
reflect the inflammatory process occurring in CU patients
independently from the presence of circulating histaminereleasing factors. This view is in line with the presence of a
cutaneous cellular infiltrate consisting mainly of neutrophils, eosinophils and T lymphocytes in CU patients either
with or without evidence of circulating histamine-releasing autoantibodies [9]. So far, the main cellular source of
MMP-9 in CU has not been defined, although it has been
demonstrated that several cell types detected in CU skin
infiltrate are able to produce and release it. MMP-9 can be
secreted as a 92 kDa zymogen (pro-MMP) by monocytes,

macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells and T
lymphocytes [6, 23-25]. TIMP-1, an inducible protein that
forms non-covalent complexes with MMPs, blocking the
access of substrates to the MMP catalytic site, is also
synthesized by many cells and tissues [4, 26]. Many
physiological functions of TIMP-1 are linked to the functions of MMPs and an altered balance of MMP and TIMP
production has been described in pathological conditions
such as arthritis, tumour growth and metastasis [26]. The
balance between MMP-9 and TIMP-1 is also altered in CU
patients because MMP-9 is increased to a greater extent
than TIMP-1, thereby contributing to the creation of a
pro-inflammatory environment.

Whatever the cellular source of MMP-9 and TIMP-1, the
data of the present study support the concept that CU is an
inflammatory disorder that may, or may not, be associated
with circulating histamine-releasing autoantibodies. In
some CU patients, namely in those with ASST and BHR
positivity, mast cell activation can be primarily ascribed to
histamine-releasing autoantibodies; in the other patients
with negative ASST and BHR, skin inflammation might be
driven by cell-mediated mechanisms. In this respect, a
role for T cells has been hypothesized following the in
vitro observation that they have the capacity to activate
mast cells directly by cell-to-cell contact [5, 14]. Although
direct activation by T cells has been demonstrated for
human mast cells derived from peripheral blood [6], but
not yet for skin mast cells, Kessel et al. [5] have suggested
that activated CD4" T cells that reside in close apposition
to cutaneous mast cell might cause mast cell degranulation and secretion of MMP-9. Further support for a
possible role of T cells in CU pathophysiology stems from
the observation of a positive correlation between a marker
of T-cell activation (the soluble IL-2 receptor) and the
mast cell-derived tryptase in CU patients [27].
