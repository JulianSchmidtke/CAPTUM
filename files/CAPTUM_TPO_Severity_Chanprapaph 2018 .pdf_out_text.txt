Background. Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is autoimmune in nature and associated with thyroid autoimmunity (TA), but
evidence on autoimmunity in relation to CSU progression and prognosis is limited. We evaluated whether TA and autoimmunity
in CSU are correlated with disease severity, therapeutic response, and time to remission and establish an association between
CSU characteristics linked to thyroid autoantibody. Methods. Medical records of patients diagnosed with urticaria attending
outpatient dermatology clinic at a university-based hospital from 2013 to 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Data on the clinical
characteristics, laboratory investigations particularly thyroid antibody titers, autologous serum skin test (ASST) and autologous
plasma skin test (APST) results and their link to disease severity, treatments, and time to remission of CSU patients were analyzed.
Results. Of 1,096 patients with urticaria, 60.2% had CSU. Three-hundred patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria for CSU with
complete thyroid antibody testing. Positive TA was significantly associated with female gender and age > 35 years (p = 0.008).
Antithyroid peroxidase (anti-T'PO)-positive patients suffered from CSU longer than 12 and 18 months compared to anti-TPOnegative patients (100.0% vs. 82.6%, p = 0.042, and 100.0% vs. 75.9% p = 0.020, respectively). The presence of urticarial attacks > 4
days/week was significantly seen in ASST and APST-positive patients compared to those without (84.6% vs. 61.3%, p = 0.011, and
85.3% vs. 61.8%, p = 0.006, respectively). Positive APST patients were more difficult to treat than those with negative results (61.2%
vs. 37.8%, p = 0.017). Conclusions. Antithyroid peroxidase is a predictor of time to remission, while autologous skin testing is linked
to disease severity (ASST and APST) and therapeutic response (APST) in CSU patients.

cutaneous disorder with an estimated prevalence of 8-10% of
the general population [4]. CSU has major undesirable effects

Thyroid autoimmunity (TA) is characterized by the production of thyroid autoantibodies and lymphocytic infiltration
into the thyroid glands. It is the most common organspecific disorder affecting approximately 5% of the general
population [1, 2]. Positive thyroid autoantibody is essential
for the diagnosis of TA. As the exact pathogenesis is unclear,
hereditary and environmental factors appear to be fundamental processes of TA [1].

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is defined as the
presences of recurrent wheals and flare for a duration of 6
weeks independent of external stimuli [3]. CSU is a common

and significantly impacts the quality of life, mainly due to
the high disease activity, sleep deprivation, and psychiatric
comorbidity. Therefore, determining factors linking to the
severe and resistant cases of CSU is important, as it allows
physicians to be more aggressive on their management plans.
Majority of cases with CSU have unknown etiology with
approximately 30-40% have autoimmune pathogenesis [5].
Assessing for autoreactivity in-vivo via autologous serum
skin test (ASST) and autologous plasma skin test (APST)
and in-vitro through basophil histamine release and basophil
activation test (BAT) are widely applied. While there is
evidence to show that BAT with or without the combination
of ASST can identify patients with more severe CSU [6, 7],
there is limited data on whether these results can predict
therapeutic response and time to remission in CSU. Coexistence of CSU with major autoimmune diseases has been
well documented, particularly autoimmune thyroid diseases
(AITD) [8]. The prevalence of positive thyroid autoantibodies in patients with urticaria is significantly higher than
nonurticaria controls [1]. Likewise, a recent population-based
study has shown that patients with AITD has higher rate of
CSU [9].While the association between TA and CSU is well
known and is one of the clinical association that contribute
to autoimmune hypothesis [6], the relationship between
antithyroid antibody and the progression and prognosis of
CSU is largely unknown. The objective of this study is to
determine the association between TA and autoimmunity of
CSU in relation to CSU disease severity, therapeutic response,
and time to remission and establish an association between
CSU characteristics linked to thyroid autoantibody.

2. Material and Methods

2.1. Study Design. A retrospective study was conducted in
a university-based hospital (Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol
University, Bangkok, Thailand). The medical records of all
patients diagnosed with urticaria visiting outpatient dermatologic clinic from January 2013 to May 2017 were retrieved
and analyzed. The study was approved from the Mahidol
University Institution Review Board (IRB) for human subject
research (protocol number 076036). Informed consent was
exempted by the board due to the retrospective nature of the
study.

2.2. Subjects. Individuals > 15 years of age who met the
diagnostic criteria of CSU, having recurrent wheals and
flare of less than 24 hours occurring at least 2 times per
week for 6 weeks without identifiable causes, were enrolled
in the study. Patients with inducible urticaria (ie., physical, pressure, cholinergic, cold, drug-induced, and acute
urticaria) were excluded. Cases suspected for or had skin
biopsy-proven urticarial vasculitis were also excluded from
the study. Patients lacking information on both autoimmune
thyroid antibodies, including anti-TPO and anti-Tg, were
excluded.

2.3. Protocol. Medical record forms were collected for
clinical and laboratory information. Data were entered
into a database program (Microsoft Excel 2013; Microsoft
Corp, Redmond, Washington). Clinical parameters involving
patients’ gender, age, duration of disease, previous history
of AITDs, atopy, systemic symptoms (i.e. angioedema, anaphylaxis), dermographism together with disease severity,
therapeutic response, and time to remission were collected.
Patients were evaluated for disease severity focusing on duration and frequency of daily attacks, wheal size and number,
severity of itch, impairment of work, and disturbance of sleep.
Therapeutic response was determined by treatment regimens
used, detailed types and dosages of antihistamines, and

other medications (H2-receptor antagonist, antileukotrienes,
cyclosporin A, omalizumab) were reviewed. Individuals
unresponsive to the standard doses of the second generation
Hl-antihistamines were categorized as difficult-to-treat cases.
The length of disease duration after treatment was recorded
and remission rate at 12 and 18 months were calculated. The
duration from the onset of CSU with the presence of thyroid
autoantibody to the development of AITD was evaluated. A
review of laboratory tests related to urticaria were conducted
(ie. Complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR), antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-TPO, anti-Tg, urine
analysis (UA), and stool exam). ANA was performed by indirect immunofluorescent technique (EUROPattern®, Euroimmun AG, Luebeck, Germany), a positive test was considered
by titer >1:80. Anti-TPO and anti-TG were performed by
electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (Elecsys®, Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Results were
positive if anti-TPO titer > 34 IU/mL or anti-TG > 15
IU/mL. Patients were categorized as having TA if at least
one anti-thyroid antibody was positive. Those with TA
were further evaluated for thyroid function test (TFT).
TFT (Abbott Diagnostics, Lake Forest, IL, USA), included
thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH, reference range, 0.354.94 ulU/mL), free triiodothyronine (FT3, reference range,
171-3.71 pg/mL), and free thyroxine (FT4, reference range,
0.7-L48 ng/dL). AITDs were diagnosed by endocrinologists. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis was diagnosed based on the
demonstration of circulating thyroid antibodies and diffuse
thyroid enlargement or reduced echogenicity on thyroid
ultrasonography. The diagnosis of Graves’ disease relies on
persistent hyperthyroidism with positive thyroid antibody
and/or increase vascularization on thyroid sonogram. The
diagnosis of subclinical thyroid diseases was made when
serum free T4 and free T3 levels remain within their respective reference ranges with the presence of abnormal TSH
levels.

Regarding skin testing, ASST and APST were utilized as
an in-vivo test to diagnose chronic autoimmune urticaria
(CAU). Antihistamines were withheld 7 days prior to testing.
Ten milliliters of venous blood were drawn to prepare the
autologous serum and plasma. To perform the skin testing,
0.05 ml of the autologous serum and plasma were injected
intradermally into the volar side of each forearm. A negative
control was done by using the same technique with 0.05 ml
of normal saline (NSS). Skin test reading was performed 30
minutes after the injections. ASST and APST were considered
positive with induction of wheal diameter exceeded that of
NSS by 1.5 mm.

2.4. Statistical Analysis. Statistical analyses were conducted
by STATA statistical software version 13 (Stata Corp LP,
College station, TX, USA). To test for associations, the
statistical methods such as Pearson's Chi-squared test and
Fisher’s exact test were used for categorical variables, while
Student's t-test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test were operated
for continuous variables with normal and non-normal distribution, respectively. Statistical significance was considered
when p-value < 0.05.

3. Results

Medical records of 1,096 patients diagnosed with urticaria
were retrospectively reviewed, 463 patients were excluded
due to the diagnosis of acute urticaria, urticarial vasculitis,
inducible urticaria. Six-hundred sixty patients satisfied the
diagnostic criteria for CSU (60.2%), while 360 patients were
excluded due to lack of one or both thyroid antibody results,
giving a total of 300 study participants fulfilling the study
inclusion criteria.

3.1. Patient Demographics. The majority of patients were
female (84.7%). Female gender was associated with TA,
elevated anti-TPO level, and elevated anti-Tg level with
statistical significance (p = 0.003, p = 0.010, and p = 0.024,
respectively). The mean age of CSU onset was 41.3 + 14.9
years. Positive TA was significantly associated with CSU onset
after 35 years of age compared to earlier age onset (75%
vs 57.6%, p = 0.008). Fifty-four patients suffered from CSU
with the presence of TA at latter onset. Of which 22.2%
(12 patients) had AITDs consisting of Graves’ disease 11.1%
(6 patients), Hashimoto's thyroid disease 5.6 % (3 patients),
subclinical hypothyroidism 3.7% (2 patients), and subclinical
hyperthyroidism 1.9% (1 patient). The association between
the onset of CSU and positive anti-Tg followed a similar
direction (78.2% vs. 58.1%, respectively, p = 0.006). The
same trend was shown for positive anti-TPO but without
statistical significance (69.8% vs. 60.1%, p = 0.187). The disease
duration ranged from 1.5-360 months (median 4 months).
For atopic diathesis, allergic rhinitis was the most frequently
reported (54.9%). The occurrences of patients with history of
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug hypersensitivity, atopy,
and dermographism, although not statistically significant,
were higher in patients with TA. The parameters for CSU
severity including frequency of attacks, wheal size, number of
wheals, severity of itch, impairment of work, and disturbance
of sleep were reported in percentage in Table 1.

In contrast to TA positivity, higher percent of CAU
patients developed CSU before or at the age of 35 years
compared to non-CAU (62.4% vs. 37.5%, p = 0.027). With
statistical difference, approximately 64% of ASST-positive
patients had history of atopy in comparison to 36.4% of ASSTnegative patients (p = 0.032). The presence of angioedema
was more commonly noted in patients with CAU, ASST and
APST positivity compared to those without CAU, or with
negative ASST and APST (p = 0.058, p = 0.183, and p = 0.085,
respectively), shown in Table 2.

 

 

3.2. Laboratory Analyses. Details of related laboratory findings are shown in Table 1. Anti-TPO and anti-Tg revealed
positive for 17.7% and 18.3%, respectively. Twenty-four percent had either anti-TPO or anti-Tg positivity while both
tests were positive in 36 patients. (Table 2, Figures 1 and
2). The frequency of high-titer-ANA-positive patients was
significantly correlated with higher frequency of TA, positive
anti-TPO, and positive anti-Tg (p = 0.015, p = 0.002, and
Pp = 0.046, respectively). The frequency of patients showing
elevated ESR was significantly higher in patients with TA and

anti-TPO positivity than those without (p = 0.035, p = 0.024,
respectively).

Autologous skin testing was carried out in 125 CSU
patients, 101 (80.8%) including 88 females (87.1%) and 13
males (12.9%) has positive results (Table 2, Figure 1). Both
tests were positive in 79 patients (Figure 3). ASST and
APST were positive in 91(72.8%) and 88 (70.4%) patients,
respectively (Figures 1 and 3).The median time to perform
the skin tests was 13 months (range 1.5-365 months) after
CSU onset. There was no statistically significant association
between TA and CAU (p = 0.316) (Tables 1 and 2).

3.3. Thyroid Autoimmunity in Patients with CSU. Of 300
patients, high anti-TPO and anti-Tg were detected in 53 and
55 patients, respectively, and both thyroid autoantibodies
were elevated in 12% (Figure 2). Seventy-two (24%) patients
with positivity to any thyroid autoantibodie(s) were diagnosed with TA and were subsequently evaluated for TFT. At
the median time of 5 months from the CSU onset, AITDs
were established in 10 patients (patient number 8, 10-12,
and 14-18). By periodically repeating TFT, two more patients
(patient number 9 and 13) were diagnosed with AITDs at the
median time of 21 months from CSU onset. AITDs which
corresponded to 15.3% (18/72; excluding patient number 3
due to negative thyroid autoantibodies) of patients showed
positivity to either anti-TPO or anti-Tg. Seven patients
suffered from AITDs prior to the onset of CSU (patient
number 1-7). Information of CSU patients with AITDs is
demonstrated in Table 3. All patients with AITDs were
female. Graves’ disease was the most common, followed by
Hashimoto’s disease. Other diagnoses included subclinical
hypothyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism, and primary
hypothyroidism.

 

3.4. Thyroid Autoantibodies and Autoimmunity in CSU as a
Predictor of CSU Prognosis

3.4.1. Disease Severity. Generally, previously mentioned clinical parameters (see Methods) for CSU severity were not
statistically different between patients with TA and the
presence of anti-TPO and anti-Tg compared to those
without.

As shown in Table 2, urticarial attacks > 4 days/week
was more frequently reported in ASST- and APST-positive
patients compared to ASST- and APST-negative patients
(84.6% vs. 61.3%, p = 0.011, and 85.3% vs. 61.8%, p = 0.006).
CAU patients had greater percentage of attacks by CSU
> 4 days/week than non-CAU patients but the statistical
significance was not reached (p = 0.086). Likewise, 73.9% of
patients with CAU experienced the number of wheals > 7
lesions/day compared to 42.9% of those without (p = 0.051).
n addition, the mean wheal diameter induced by autologous
plasma was significantly associated with number of wheals >
7 lesions/day (9.4 mm vs. 7.9 mm, p = 0.037). Other clinical
and laboratory indicators for severity including wheal size,
severity of itch and disturbance of sleep were not significantly
correlated with either the presence of CAU, positive ASST, or
positive APST.

3.4.2. Therapeutic Response. Second-generation H1-antihistamines exceeding standard dosages either given singly
or in combination with other Hl-antihistamine(s) were
administered in over half of the patients (57.0%) while the
rest were controlled with standard-dose-H1-antihistamine
(Table 1). Cyclosporin A, omalizumab, monteleukast, and
H2-receptor antagonist were prescribed in 2, 1, 3, and 17
patients, respectively. The presence of TA, anti-TPO, or
anti-Tg did not significantly influence therapeutic response
(p = 0.667, p = 0.296, and p = 0.819, respectively).

In terms of CAU, patients with positive APST had
higher frequency of commencing second generation Hlantihistamine(s) exceeding standard dosages compared to
negative APST (61.2% vs. 37.8%, p = 0.017). The association
of CAU and difficult-to-treat cases showed similar pattern
but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.069), however,

3.4.3. Time to Remission. As shown in Table 1, 85.5% and
80.2% suffered from persistent CSU of more than 12 and
18 months, respectively. Patients with TA had active disease
longer than 12 and 18 months after therapy compared to those
without (93.3% vs. 83.2% and 92.0% and 76.3%, respectively)
though the statistical difference was not reached (p = 0.240
and p = 0.088, respectively). A similar pattern was observed in
anti-Tg-positive and anti-Tg-negative group. However, antiTPO-positive patients were significantly more prevalent in
attaining persistent disease longer than 12 and 18 months
(100% vs. 82.6%, p = 0.042 and 100% vs. 75.9%, p = 0.020,
respectively).

The percentages of patients with active CSU at 12 or 18
months, in CAU or non-CAU group, in ASST-positive or
ASST-negative group, or in APST-positive or APST-negative
group were not significantly different (Table 2).

4. Discussion

The clinical spectrum and outcome of patients with urticaria
is variable, hence, multiple factors may be involved in the
clinical and prognostic polymorphism. Early predictions
on CSU as to whom would be expected to have severe,
difficult-to-treat and/or long-lasting disease is desirable for
proper patient education and appropriate management plans,
therefore, our study is among the few to evaluate these factors
in association to TA and autoimmunity in CSU.

Of 1,096 patients, 60.2% fulfilled the criteria for the
diagnosis of CSU. The prevalence corresponds to the previous
reports of 56-93%. The frequency of TA was 24.0% (17.7%
for anti-TPO and 18.3% for anti-Tg) and 6.3% had AITDs
(Figure 1). Literature reports on the prevalence of TA ranged
from 4.3-57%, among this 5-10% have clinically apparent
thyroid disease [10, 11]. In a national survey of normal Thai
atients, anti-TPO and anti-Tg were positive in 8.9% and
12.3%, respectively [11]. Our study confirms higher prevalence
of TA in the CSU population. We also highlight that AITDs
could manifest as early as 9 years prior to or up to 5 years
following CSU onset (Table 3). More importantly, many
atients were diagnosed by subsequent TFT evaluation. We
emphasize that periodic evaluation of TFT is crucial in
CSU patients showing positive thyroid autoantibodies. The
definite mechanism behind the association between TA and
urticaria remains to be determined. However, postulated
hypothesis for autoimmune CSU involves two mechanisms:
type I and II autoimmunity [12]. In type I autoimmune
CSU, IgE autoantibodies bind to high affinity mast cell
receptor. Anti-TPO is one of the most common CSUassociated autoallergen identified [13]. In type II autoimmune
CSU, particularly autoimmunity type IIb, IgG autoantibody
is responsible for mast cell degranulation via activation of
high-affinity IgE receptor. The definitive diagnosis of this
type relies on positive autologous skin test and/or BAT and
histamine release test [13]. Evidence have shown that there
is a strong link between elevated levels of IgG antithyroid
antibodies and CSU [14]. Therefore, autoimmune CSU in our
subpopulation could possibly be classified as autoimmunity
type IIb. Genetic and environmental factors could also be
attributed. Another possible pathogenesis is that antithyroid
drugs, ie., methimazole, carbimazole, or propylthiouracil,
may cause itching and urticaria as seen in several patients
in the present study commencing these medication prior
to the onset of CSU (Table 3) [15]. Moreover, exposure
to specific circulating antigen particularly as a result of
autoimmune thyroid damage, anti-TPO IgE is produced
and may potentially induce urticarial symptoms, mast cell
sensitization and degranulation [16]. Nevertheless, to date,
there is insufficient evidence to prove that thyroid autoantibodies are pathogenic for CSU and studies have failed to
demonstrate cross-reactivity between antithyroid antibody

and other autoantibodies in CSU. In addition, antithyroid
antibodies alone are not capable of inducing mast cell
activation [17].

In agreement with other reports, TA is more prevalent in

females (female: male 5.5:1) [18-20]. The proposed mechanisms for female preponderance may involve the underlying
state of inflammation driven by adipokines, especially leptin,
TNF-a, and IL-6, and several receptors including Toll-like
receptors on thyrocytes. Because leptin levels are higher in
females, the function of thyrocytes in innate immunity fails
to act properly against triggers such as viruses, bacteria, and
stress. This then contributes to the initiation step to break
tolerance to thyroid self-antigens [19]. The mean age onset
of our patients was 41.3 + 14.9 years. This was similar to
that demonstrated in the literature [18, 20]. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first to report the statistically
significant association between the presence of TA and the
age of CSU onset older than 35 years. Regarding ANA testing,
the percentage of patients showing positive ANA titer >1:320
was slightly lower than that of a recent report (17.5%) [20].
This difference can be partially justified by different groups
of population and ethnicity. Of note, our study highlights
the significant correlation between TA and positive hightiter ANA among CSU patients. This supports earlier studies
in CSU showing the association between ANA and TA [21,
22]. It is believed that the presence of non-organ-specific
autoantibodies such as ANA, may demonstrate a polyclonally
accelerated production of autoantibodies by immune cells
and also thyrocytes [22]. However, the presence of ANA titer
= 1:320 can be found in 1.4% of the healthy population [23].
Moreover, of 32 patients with positive high-titer ANA, only
2 were diagnosed with lupus erythematosus. Therefore, the
presence of positive ANA may not necessarily be pathologic
and the clinical significance of ANA positivity remains to be
determined.
Our findings suggested that early age onset of before
35 years may predict autoimmune basis of CSU. This is
compatible with the earlier study reporting that patients
with CAU were relatively younger than non-CAU patients
[24]. Sharing IgE-mediated mechanism, CSU is believed to
be associated with allergic dysentery. We found a strong
association between atopy and ASST positivity. Reports in the
literature are mostly but not always consistent with this [24,
25]. Regarding ANA positivity, although strong association
was lacking, it was more prevalent in CAU patients. Larger
number of participants may yield more apparent results.

Our study demonstrated a relatively higher frequency
of CAU patients (80.8%) and also ASST (72.8%) and APST
positivity (70.4%) compared to previous literature [25-27].
However, similar to our findings, reports of considerably
high positivity for ASST (66%) and APST (86%) have been
demonstrated [28, 29]. An explanation for these discrepancies could be from differences in the study population, patient
selection, and criteria adopted to score the test [30]. Unlike
some reports, we did not find an association between positive
autologous skin testing and the presence of antithyroid antibodies [18, 31]. However, our finding is consistent with those
of Kocatiirk, Yadav, and Alpay et al. [32-34]. Therefore, the
association between CAU and TA remains controversial and

 

 

 
BioMed Research International

requires further validation. The presence of TA or positive
anti-TPO could serve as a predictor for elevated ESR but not
for other clinical parameters. We believe that it is appropriate
to monitor ESR in patients with CSU which represents a
chronic inflammatory condition. Our study showed that at
the end of 12 months, symptoms of CSU persisted in 85.5%
of participants and 80.2% existed after 18 months. These
figures are relatively high compared to previous reports [27,
35, 36]. This could be due to the high referral rate and more
severe and persistent CSU patients sent to our specialized
outpatient clinic. Of the thyroid antibodies, anti-TPO alone
played a significant role in predicting persistent disease of
CSU. An explanation to longer CSU duration related to
thyroid antibody remains unclear. A possible mechanism is
that long-lasting CSU may result from prolonged T-cell stimulation followed by extended polyclonal activation and the
production of various inflammatory mediators. This could
possibly induce the production of other autoantibodies such
as anti-TPO. Toubi et al. also found that thyroid antibody is
associated with CSU disease duration [27]. In our study, only
anti-TPO, not anti-Tg, predicted longer disease duration.
Anti-TPO is indeed more sensitive and specific than antiTg for TA [37]. Moreover, anti-TPO also has superiority
over anti-Tg for detecting AITDs such as Graves’ disease
and Hashimoto thyroiditis [38]. In addition, autoantibodies
against the complement controller domain of TPO can
activate complement through the classical pathway and raise
C4a levels at baseline normalized in remission after treatment
with levothyroxine. However, the potential role of anti-TPO
in the pathogenesis of CSU remains to be determined [39].

The current study reinforced previous findings that ASST
and/or APST could serve as a predictor for CSU severity
including higher wheal number and more frequent attacks
[26, 40, 41]. Interestingly, not only is the skin testing associated with CSU activity, but the wheal diameter could predict
disease severity as well. Although, autologous skin testing
did not show benefit in predicting disease duration, our
results proved that APST can be used as a potential marker
to predict difficult-to-treat cases requiring antihistamines
exceeding standard dosing. Our results are in line with that
of Staubach et al. proving that ASST positive patients were
ikely to use more antihistaminic medication than ASST
negative patients [42]. Viswanathan et al. also demonstrated
that commercially available basophil histamine release assay
had strong association to refractoriness of antihistamines
20]. There is controversy regarding the advantage of APST
and ASST over the other. Few studies have shown that
APST gave higher percentage of positive result than ASST
as coagulation factors in plasma might have a pivotal role in
athogenesis and severity of CSU [29, 43], whereas others
have shown indifferences between them [44, 45]. Based on
our finding, we believe that APST could be a parameter to
redict therapeutic response in CSU; however, more research
is needed to validate this finding

The limitation of this study includes its retrospective
nature. Subjective evaluation of medical record was performed rather than using a validated instrument for disease
severity such as the urticaria activity score [46]. Autoimmune
CSU was confirmed by positive ASST and APST results, while

 

 

 

 

il

BAT and histamine release test was not applied. Moreover,
this study lacked the standard protocol for management.
Step-wise algorithm for the treatment of CSU was not given
to all patients; e.g., some patients were utilizing 2x daily
antihistamine or more than one type of antihistamine, rather
than the current recommended 4x dosing [46]. Finally, all
patients were collected from a single center at a tertiary institution which may represent a more severe subgroup of CSU
due to referral bias. However, the large sample size and the
unified protocol for evaluation for all parameters conduced
in this study should give more information regarding TA
and autoimmunity in CSU linked to the disease severity and
prognosis in CSU. Nevertheless, future prospective work is
warranted to confirm our results.

In conclusion, we demonstrate that anti-TPO can potentially indicate longer CSU disease duration while autoimmunity in CSU can predict disease severity and therapeutic
response. We recommend evaluating thyroid antibodies in
patients with CSU particularly in females, patients > 35 years
of age. Moreover, in all CSU patients especially < 35 years old,
autologous skin testing is highly suggested.
