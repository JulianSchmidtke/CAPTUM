The potential role of omalizumab in the
treatment of chronic urticaria

Treatment of chronic urticaria refractory to antihistamines presents a challenge to
both people affected with the disease as well as the physicians who treat them.
Omalizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IgE, has emerged as one potential
solution to this challenge. In several clinical trials published between 2011 and 2013,
omalizumab significantly reduced or eliminated symptoms of chronic urticaria. The
optimal dose for chronic urticaria is 300 mg administered every 4 weeks, a dose that
differs from those used in asthma, which are based on the patient’s weight and IgE
level. Omalizumab does not appear to cause lasting symptom remission, and the ideal
duration of treatment for chronic urticaria has not been defined.

Introduction to chronic urticaria

Chronic urticaria is defined as hives on most
days of the week for more than 6 weeks Q.
Approximately 20% of cases are due to
physical stimuli, and of the remainder, the
majority are considered to be idiopathic (2).
In half of the cases, there is evidence for an
autoimmune process, based on a positive
autologous serum skin test, basophil histamine release or basophil activation testing,
but the evidence that chronic urticaria is
an ‘autoimmune’ disease is controversial (3).
Approximately 3% of the population suffers
from chronic urticaria at some point in their
lives [4]. The EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF/WAO
Urticaria Treatment Guidelines recommend
initial treatment with standard doses of
nonsedating antihistamines, and increased
doses up to four-times the standard in those
who do not respond to standard doses [5].
Depending on the population studied and
dose of antihistamines used, approximately
10-50% of cases of chronic urticaria will
not respond to antihistamines [6,7]. For those
patients, the guidelines recommend addition
of leukotriene receptor antagonist or changing the nonsedating antihistamine, and use
of steroids for flares for 3-7 days at a time [5].

However, the toxicity of corticosteroids
makes them undesirable for long-term treatment [8]. If patients are still symptomatic,
immunomodulatory treatment with cyclosporine or dapsone is recommended in the
EAACI guidelines. Omalizumab (Xolair®,
Genentech Inc., CA, USA) is also mentioned
as an option for treatment. A position paper
rom the World Allergy Organization pubished in 2012 makes similar recommendations (9). A recent review article proposes
‘step-up/step-down’ treatment for those who
have failed other treatments, specifically,
cyclosporine and omalizumab comprise the
ourth step in the treatment approach [10].

 

n March 2014, omalizumab was approved
in Europe and in the USA as add-on therapy for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria in adults and adolescents with
inadequate response to H1-antihistamine
treatment [11].

Immunomodulatory treatment with cyclosporine has the greatest quantity of published
data, and the evidence was outlined in a recent
review article [12]. Another immunomodulatory treatment with success in urticaria is mycophenolate mofetil (13,14). There is also evidence
for efficacy of other anti-inflammatory and

immunomodulatory treatments including sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate in treatment of chronic urticaria [15,16]. However, each of these
medications have significant limitations, including slow
onset of action of weeks to months with sulfasalazine,
hydroxychloroquine and dapsone, and potentially serious side effects that require intensive monitoring including hypertension and renal failure with cyclosporine, and
teratogenicity with mycophenolate mofetil [12,17]. Thus,
omalizumab is an attractive treatment option, given its
relatively benign side-effect profile and generally rapid
onset of action.

Introduction to omalizumab

Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal
antibody to IgE. It was created by inserting a mouse
complementarity-determining region of monoclonal
anti-IgE onto the consensus sequence of human IgGl.
Omalizumab binds to IgE at the CH3 domain, which
is the same epitope that binds to the a-chain of FceRI,
the high-affinity IgE receptor. Thus, omalizumab forms
complexes with circulating, non-receptor-bound IgE
and once IgE is bound to omalizumab, it cannot bind.
to its receptor [18]. For this reason, omalizumab does
not induce spontaneous histamine release from surfacebound IgE on basophils and mast cells. Complexes of
IgE and omalizumab are primarily heterotrimers. By
binding up free IgE, omalizumab decreases the availability of IgE to bind to IgE receptors. IgE bound to
FceRI stabliizes the FceRI on mast cells and basophils.
A loss of free IgE able to bind to FceRI thus results in
decreased expression of high-affinity IgE receptors on
mast cells and basophils [19]. After 3 months of treatment with anti-IgE antibody in 15 atopic patients, free
IgE decreased to 1% of prior levels and FceRI levels
decreased from 220,000 to 8300 receptors per basophil, which is approximately 4% of pretreatment levels.
In a subset of these patients, this decrease in number
occurred over only 3 days [20]. A similar effect on skin
mast cells was demonstrated in three patients with allergic rhinitis undergoing intradermal skin testing and
subsequent skin biopsy. Compared with controls, those
treated with omalizumab had decreased skin mast cell
expression of FceRI, as measured by the expression of
the a-chain, at 70 and 196 days of omalizumab treatment, as well as decreased wheal size in response to
the allergen {21}. A decrease in receptor numbers then
decreases release of mediators and subsequent allergic
inflammation [22]. All of the studies on omalizumab’s
mechanism of action have been performed in atopic
patients, and since most patients with chronic urticaria
are not atopic, the exact mechanism of omalizumab’s
action in chronic urticaria is unknown. In the studies
of omalizumab in chronic urticaria, the drug is slowly

absorbed, reaching peak concentrations at 7-8 days,
and its terminal half-life is 19-22 days (23).

Clinical efficacy of omalizumab in chronic
urticaria

While omalizumab has been FDA approved for treatment of allergic asthma since 2003, the first case report
of omalizumab’s use in chronic urticaria was not published until 2006. This report noted improvement of
cold-induced urticaria in a 12-year-old child after initiation of omalizumab for allergic asthma, with complete resolution of symptoms after 5 months of treatment (24]. The next year, a case series of three patients
with chronic idiopathic urticaria was published. Their
symptoms previously were resistant to antihistamines
and antileukotrienes, but resolved with omalizumab,
and two out of the three experienced resolution within
1 week of starting treatment (25). Following the initial case reports, in 2008, Kaplan’s proof-of-concept
study examined the use of omalizumab in 12 chronic
urticaria patients whose symptoms were refractory to
antihistamines [26]. It found that omalizumab administered by asthma dosing tables that adjusted the dose
for weight and initial IgE levels (from 75 to 375 mg
administered every 2—4 weeks) for 16 weeks resulted
ina significant reduction in symptoms, with mean
urticaria activity scores dropping from a baseline of
75 to 2.6 in the final 4 weeks of treatment [26]. In
this study, 58% of patients had complete resolution
of symptoms and 92% had some symptom improvement. Rescue medication use decreased and quality
of life also improved with treatment. All patients in

 

this study had positive ‘autoimmune’ markers, defined.
by a positive autologous serum skin test and basophil
histamine release [26].

Two Phase II studies published in 2011 examined
the use of omalizumab versus placebo in larger populations of patients with chronic urticaria. In the first,
Maurer examined a specific and unusual subset of
patients with chronic urticaria who demonstrated IgE
autoantibodies to thyroperoxidase and had symptoms
refractory to antihistamines (27]. In this study, 49 subjects were treated with either omalizumab or placebo for
24 weeks, with dosing based on asthma dosing tables
that adjusted the dose for weight and initial IgE levels
(from 75 to 375 mg administered every 2—4 weeks).
Of the subjects treated with omalizumab, symptoms
measured by the urticarial activity score over 7 days
(UAS7) were significantly reduced from baseline compared with placebo (reduction of 17.8 vs 7.9). In addition, 19 out of the 27, or 70% of, subjects treated with
omalizumab experienced complete resolution of their
urticaria symptoms, compared with one out of 22, or
4.5% of, placebo-treated subjects.

The potential role of omalizumab in the treatment of chronic urticaria. Drug Evaluation

While the two prior studies treated subjects with
chronic urticaria with doses of omalizumab based on
asthma dosing tables, those tables were developed for
an atopic population that typically has elevated IgE
levels. Chronic urticaria patients typically have normal IgE levels and the need for adjustment of dosing
based on IgE levels was not clear. The second Phase II
study published in 2011 was Saini’s dose-ranging study
of omalizumab in 90 subjects with chronic idiopathic
urticaria refractory to antihistamines. This study
examined the effect of omalizumab 75, 300, 600 mg or
placebo administered as a one-time dose on symptoms
4 weeks later [23]. There was a significant improvement
in symptoms at 4 weeks in both the 300- and 6000-mg
groups, with the 300-mg group reducing urticarial
activity scores by 19.9 and the 600-mg group reducing urticarial activity scores by 14.6, both significantly
more than the reduction of 6.9 in the placebo group.
More than half of the patients in the 300- and 600-mg
groups reported a >50% symptom improvement from
baseline, and a 100% symptom improvement was
noted in 36% of the 300-mg and 28.6% of the 600-mg
treatment groups. Furthermore, symptoms improved
rapidly within the first 1-2 weeks after administration
of omalizumab (23). It is worth noting that this study
did not select for patients with ‘autoimmune’ urticaria
or patients with potentially pathologic IgE, as the prior
studies did, but demonstrated efficacy of omalizumab
in a general population of chronic urticaria patients.
This suggested a broader applicability of this treatment, but optimal dosing and duration of treatment
was unknown.

Two Phase III studies examined the use of omalizumab to treat chronic urticaria in larger populations
over longer periods of time. Maurer examined the use of
omalizumab in 323 patients with chronic urticaria who
were symptomatic despite standard doses of H1-antihistamines (28). This study compared omalizumab 75,
150 and 300 mg to placebo, administered every 4 weeks
for 12 weeks (three total injections). There was a signif
icant decrease in itch severity score as well as the weekly
urticarial activity score (UAS7) in both the 150- and
300-mg groups. The 150-mg group had a decrease of
8.1 in itch severity score and a decrease of 17.1 in UAS7
from baseline, and the 300-mg group had a decrease
of 9.8 in itch severity score and a decrease of 21.8 in
UAS7 from baseline. By the end of treatment, 43%
in the 150-mg group and 66% in the 300-mg group
achieved a minimal symptom level of UAS7 <6. All
subjects were followed for an additional 16 weeks after
treatment was stopped, and symptom scores gradually
increased over time in all groups, and by the end of the
follow-up, period scores in the treatment groups were
similar to the placebo group’s [28]. Kaplan’s Phase III

study is the largest and longest published to date, and
it assessed the effect of omalizumab 300 mg administered every 4 weeks for 24 weeks (six total injections) in
336 subjects, with a follow-up period of 16 weeks [29].
The population in this study included relatively more
severely affected subjects compared with Maurer’s
study. These subjects had all failed to achieve symptom
control with greater than standard H1-antihistamines,
plus H2-antihistamines and/or leukotriene receptor
antagonists. It demonstrated a significant reduction in
itch severity of 8.5 after 12 weeks, with similar effect
at 24 weeks. Symptom remission, defined as a UAS7
of 0, occurred in a third of subjects by 12 weeks, and
reduction of symptoms to a negligible amount, defined
as a UAS7 <6 occurred in half of all patients [29]. During the follow-up period, symptom scores gradually
increased, and reached placebo score levels by the end
of the 16 weeks of follow-up. This study demonstrated
omalizumab’s efficacy in a more severely affected population of subjects with chronic urticaria, who had failed
second- and third-line treatments.

In addition to clinical efficacy, most of the trials
have examined the impact of omalizumab on quality
of life, which is an important patient-related outcome
in chronic urticaria [30]. Mean Dermatology Quality
of Life Index (DQLI) scores significantly improved
from baseline to week 12 in Kaplan’s 2008 study, and
there were statistically significant differences in DQLI
between the omalizumab and placebo groups in Maurer’s 2011 and 2013 studies, as well as Kaplan’s 2013
study [27-29]. Significant changes were also observed
in the Skindex 29 and urticaria-specific quality-of-life
questionnaire, the Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life
Questionnaire (CU-Q,oL) [27.28]. For a summary of
this section, please see Table 1.

Safety & tolerability of omalizumab

In the published studies on chronic urticaria, omalizumab was generally well tolerated, without serious
adverse events compared with placebo. The risk of anaphylaxis with omalizumab is listed as a black-box warning on the US prescribing information for omalizumab,
due to 0.1% frequency of anaphylaxis attributed to the
medication in premarketing studies and to 0.2% frequency in postmarketing studies on asthma [31]. However, no anaphylactic reactions were reported in the
Phase II or III trials (23,27-29]. Furthermore, no patients
developed anti-omalizumab antibodies after 40 weeks
in Kaplan’s study 29). The omalizumab prescribing
information also notes that malignancies occurred
with greater frequency in patients treated with omalizumab (0.5%) versus placebo (0.2%) in premarketing
studies in asthma, with follow-up generally <1 year (31).
However, no malignancies have been reported in the

In addition, further studies on asthma patients have not

up for 9-11 months [35]. This population was a
severely affected one, with 13 out of 16 patients haying required oral steroids to control their symptoms
in the past. In this study, 88% of subjects improved
after six injections of omalizumab, with ten out of 16
(62%) achieving remission after one injection, four
out of 16 (25%) achieving remission after 2—6 injections, and two patients not improving after two doses
and discontinuing treatment. Dosing was spread out
to every 6-8 weeks ifimprovement occurred; however,
this resulted in flares of symptoms in two patients.
In follow-up, of the 14 patients who achieved initial
remission with omalizumab, four patients (29%)
remained in remission despite no further omalizumab
for 9 months, seven patients (50%) continued on
omalizumab with continued control of symptoms, and.
three (22%) who initially responded to omalizumab
developed symptoms refractory to omalizumab {35}.
This suggests that a subset of patients may be able to
stop omalizumab after a short period of time, but that
most patients will need to continue treatment for continued symptom control. It is concerning that in this
retrospective, open-label study, a minority of patients
who initially responded to omalizumab seemed to
become refractory to it, which was not noted in the
Phase III clinical trials.

Lefévre et al. retrospectively analyzed 15 patients
with chronic urticaria treated with omalizumab
150-300 mg every 4 weeks, who were followed for
up to 37 months of treatment [36]. One patient had
no improvement after 2 months and stopped, but
all others had symptom improvement and were followed for between 2 and 37 months, with an average
of 15.53 months of observation. During this time,
none of the patients could maintain symptom control
with antihistamines or immunosuppressants alone,
and symptom scores increased in the week prior to
omalizumab administration. This study suggests
that treatment for over a year with omalizumab is
sufficient to control symptoms, but it does suggest
that omalizumab does not cause remission in most
patients even after 1.25 years of treatment in most
patients. Taken together, these two studies suggest
that long-term treatment with omalizumab may help
with symptom control in those who initially respond
to treatment, but attempts to spread out treatments
or stop treatments will generally result in symptom
flares.

Patient-related outcomes

Subjects with chronic urticaria treated with omalizumab have experienced significant improvements
in their quality of life in the published trials. Future
studies should continue to examine multiple measures

of quality of life including DQLI and CU-Q,oL,
as well as other patient-related outcomes including reductions in antihistamine use and need for
corticosteroids.

Populations to treat

While the clinical trials suggest that omalizumab is an
effective treatment for most patients with chronic urticaria, predicting which patients may respond to omalizumab is not possible at this point. A small subset of
patients with chronic idiopathic/spontaneous urticaria
seems to not respond to omalizumab at all, and how
to identify this group of patients is not clear. While
the initial proof-of-concept study in 2008 only looked
at patients with ‘autoimmune’ urticaria, defined as a
positive autologous serum skin test or presence of antiIgE receptor antibodies, omalizumab’s efficacy is not
limited to this subset of patients and the Phase III trials
did not report results of these ‘autoimmune’ tests for
urticaria. It appears that this is not an important distinction in determining who will respond to treatment
among patients with chronic idiopathic/spontaneous
urticaria.

The efficacy of omalizumab for physical urticaria is
also unclear. While the first case report outlined omalizumab’s success in cold urticaria, the Phase II and III
clinical trials have focused on patients with idiopathic/
spontaneous chronic urticaria. It is unknown whether
the efficacy of omalizumab in these trials translates
to patients with primarily physical urticarias. Case
reports are conflicting, as there have been case reports
that suggested omalizumab reduced symptoms of
cold, solar, cholinergic and delayed pressure urticaria,
but other case reports have noted lack of improvement
of solar and cholinergic urticaria after treatment with
omalizumab (37). Thus, due to lack of quality data, at
this point, it is not possible to extrapolate the efficacy
of omalizumab in chronic idiopathic/spontaneous
urticaria to physical urticaria.

Certain populations have not been included in clinical trials, including pregnant women and. children,
and the effect of omalizumab is unknown in these
populations. Chronic urticaria most commonly affects
women in between their 30s and 40s, a time during
which childbearing can be a consideration, but the
effect of omalizumab on chronic urticaria in women
who are trying to conceive, pregnant or nursing has
not been studied in clinical trials. There is an ongoing database of women treated with omalizumab for
asthma before or during pregnancy, but it does not
include women treated for chronic urticaria [38]. Omalizumab has also not been studied in young children
with chronic urticaria, as most studies used a cutoff
age of 12 or 18 years.

Conclusion

Chronic urticaria refractory to treatment with antihistamines has been a challenging condition for both
patients affected by the disease and physicians treating them, due to the toxicities of second- and thirdline treatments and limited data available on them.
In the clinical trials published, omalizumab dosed at
300 mg every 4 weeks seems to be an ideal treatment
for antihistamine refractory chronic urticaria, with
most patients responding to treatment with minimal side effects. In the future, assessment of optimal
duration of treatment, as well as the efficacy of omalizumab in subtypes of chronic physical urticarias that
were not previously studied and populations previously
excluded from clinical trials should help guide further
treatment.
