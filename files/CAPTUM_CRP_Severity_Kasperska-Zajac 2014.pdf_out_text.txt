Background. The platelet parameters and C-reactive protein (CRP) are markers reflecting a systemic inflammatory response. Among
those, CRP is one of the major proteins helpful in determination of severity/activity of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). Aim.
To determine relationships between platelet activation indices and serum concentration of CRP, the best marker of acute phase
response, and their potential clinical use in CSU patients. Methods. Mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width
(PDW), and platelet count as well as serum CRP concentration were measured in CSU patients, showing different degrees of
urticarial severity, and in the healthy subjects. Results. No significant differences were found in MPV and PDW between CSU
group and the healthy subjects. The platelet count was significantly higher in moderate-severe CSU than that of the controls and
mild CSU patients. Serum CRP concentrations were significantly higher in CSU patients as compared with the healthy subjects
and significantly correlated with the platelet count in CSU patients. Conclusions. Acute phase response in CSU is associated with
the increased number of circulating platelets in patients with more severe symptoms. It seems that simple determination of platelet
size indices is not a reliable indicator of CSU severity/activity.

 

1. Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is an inflammatory
disease, characterized by acute phase response (APR) [1, 2].
In many cases it may be caused by an interactive combination
of immune, genetic, and environmental factors, including
infections [3-5]. In addition, the altered function of the
neuroendocrine-immune system has been recognized in
CSU pathogenesis [6, 7].

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker of systemic CSU
activity, reflecting the systemic effects of inflammatory mediators, associated with the disease, including IL-6 [8, 9].

Similarly to CRP, the platelet parameters are markers reflecting the systemic inflammatory response and

activity/severity of many diseases [10-12]. Moreover, such
cells play an important and active role in the immuneinflammatory response [13]. Platelet volume indices, such
as mean platelet volume (MPV), an indicator of platelet
size, and platelet distribution width (PDW), an index of
platelet size heterogeneity, have been shown to be the markers
of platelet function and activation [10-12]. Higher MPV
was associated with low-grade inflammatory conditions
and a variety of risk factors of cardiovascular disorders
[10, 14].

On the one hand, CSU is associated with an increased
level of CRP and IL-6, parallel to the disease severity/activity
{9, 15]. Interestingly, it is known that IL-6 stimulates the
synthesis of CRP and thrombocytosis [16, 17]. Data regarding
platelet activation markers in CSU are scarce and contradictory [15, 18-21]. Taken together, it seems reasonable to
determine the relationships between the platelet characteristics (count, MPV, and PDW) and serum concentration of
CRP, the best marker of acute phase response, as well as their
potential clinical use in CSU patients.

2. Material and Methods

Sixty-six patients (20 men and 46 women; median age
38 years) with active chronic spontaneous urticaria of 12
months mean disease duration (range 4-52 months) were
selected for the study. Physical urticaria was studied by
history and/or diagnostic tests (3 patients had concomitant
dermographism).

Urticaria activity score (UAS) was estimated during four
days and on the day of blood sampling: (no wheals = 0,
1-10 wheals = 1, 11-50 wheals = 2, >50 wheals = 3) and
pruritus intensity (no = 0, mild = 1, moderate = 2, and
severe = 3). UAS scores were as follows: daily (minimum = 0;
maximum = 6) and four days by adding the daily score values
(minimum = 0; maximum = 24) [22]. The UAS was graded
as follows: 0-8 (mild), 9-16 (moderate), and 17-24 (severe).
Our study comprised 28 patients with mild and 38 patients
with moderate-severe urticaria symptoms as per the four days
UAS. Each patient underwent the following investigations:
routine laboratory tests (full blood count, urine analysis, ESR,
C-reactive protein, serum glucose, hepatic functions, and
creatinine), immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE) and
complement in serum/plasma, stool (for parasites), hepatitis
serology (anti-HCV, HBsAg), antinuclear and anti-thyroid
microsomal antibodies, thyroid function and H. pylori tests,
and abdominal ultrasonography.

None of the examined subjects had taken any oral
corticosteroids or antidepressants within 8 weeks or antihistamines within at least 4 days before the study. Autologous
serum skin test (ASST) [4] and other investigations had been
performed to exclude any known causes of the diseases or
the concomitant diseases. Among those, routine dental and
ENT consultations were performed to exclude the infectious
foci. The diseases/conditions and drugs, which are known
to be associated with changes in platelet function, have
been excluded, including smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, coronary, peripheral arterial disease, valvular
heart disease, stroke and pulmonary embolism, and autoimmune diseases. There were no differences in cholesterol levels
between the groups.

The control group consisted of 36 sex-, age-, and BMI
(<25) matched healthy subjects. None of the controls took any
medication for at least 14 days before the study.

The Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Silesia
approved the study.

3. Blood Collection
Fasting blood samples containing tripotassium ethylenedi
aminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were obtained between 7 and
9a.m. by antecubital puncture. Analyses were performed

BioMed Research International

immediately after sampling to prevent in vitro platelet activation.

4. Assay of CRP

Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were assayed
using Cobas 6000 analyzer with c501 module (Roche,
Switzerland).

5. Assay of the Platelet Count and Indices

The platelet count, mean platelet volume (MPV), and platelet
distribution width (PDW) were analyzed using Sysmex XT2000i automated hematology analyzer (Sysmex, Japan).

5.1. Statistical Analysis. Results are expressed as median
and interquartile ranges. Because data were not distributed
normally, nonparametric tests were used. Kruskal-Wallis
variance analysis was used to screen differences between the
groups. Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare data
between the patient groups and the normal subjects. Spearman’s rank test was used for correlations. The probability
value of P < .05 was assumed significant.

6. Results

6.1. Platelet Count and Indices. The comparison of platelet
parameters of CSU patients and the healthy subjects is
presented in Table 1.

No significant differences were found in MPV and PDW
between CSU groups and the healthy subjects. There were
no significant differences in platelet count between the CSU
patients (as a whole) and the healthy subjects. However,
platelet count was significantly higher in moderate-severe
CSU than those of the controls and mild CSU patients.

6.2. Serum CRP Concentration. The comparison of laboratory parameters of CSU patients and the healthy subjects is
presented in Table 1.

Serum CRP concentrations were significantly higher in
CSU patients as compared with the healthy subjects. In
addition, there were significant differences in serum CRP
concentrations between patients with mild and moderatesevere CSU as well as the healthy subjects.

No significant differences in serum CRP concentrations
between ASST(+) and ASST(—) CSU patients were observed.

6.3. Associations. The correlation in CSU patients and the
controls is presented in Table 2. Serum CRP concentration
significantly correlated with platelet count in CSU patients.
Significant correlations were found between MPV, PDW, and
platelet count in the healthy subjects. In addition, significant
correlation was shown between platelet count and PDW in
SCU group.

Also there were no significant correlations between the
disease duration and CRP, the platelet indices (platelet count,
MPV, and PDW).

7. Discussion

As expected, we confirmed the previous findings indicating
that patients with CSU, particularly those with a more
severe disease, show signs of the low-grade inflammation as
supported by the elevated concentration of CRP in serum
15, 23, 24].

It has been reported that platelet count is not increased in
CSU [18]. Unfortunately, the patients were not divided by the
disease activity/severity. Similarly, there were no differences
in platelet count in other studies [15, 19]. In the present study,
ike in the previous one, there was no significant difference
in platelet count between CSU patients (as a whole) and
the controls. However, the platelet count was elevated in
moderate-severe CSU, as compared to mild CSU and the
controls. Similarly, mean platelet number was significantly
igher in children with CSU when compared to the healthy
children [20].

In our study, patients with mild and moderate-severe
CSU showed all values of the platelet count within the normal
range. Interestingly, the platelet count correlated with serum
CRP concentration, a marker of urticarial inflammation,
which is known as parallel to the disease severity/activity,
thus probably reflecting the same characteristic of the inflammatory response in CSU.

Inflammatory thrombocytosis is thought to be related to
acute phase reactants, which may act through thrombopoietin (TPO) to increase the platelet count [17]. It has been

 

hypothesized that, in inflammatory states and malignant
diseases, thrombocytosis might be mediated through an IL6-induced increase in TPO levels [16, 17]. It is well known
that CSU is associated with activation of APR and increased
concentration of IL-6. Our study showed significant correlation between platelet count and serum concentration of CRP,
the best marker of APR stimulated by IL-6.

It is recognized that an inverse relationship occurs
normally between MPV and the platelet count in healthy
subjects, which was also confirmed in our control group [25].
In contrast there was no significant correlation between the
two parameters in CSU patients, characterized by increased
platelet count.

The similar MPV in mild and more severe CSU patients
as well as in healthy subjects observed in our study is not
consistent with those indicated by other studies. In contrast,
the previous reports showed that MPV is increased [15, 19] or
decreased [20] in CSU patients.

MPV vas significantly lower in children with CSU when
compared to healthy children [22].

On the other hand, it has been reported that antihistamines-resistant CSU was characterized by higher MPV and
statistically significant elevation of liver transaminases, which
may be related to hepatic fat accumulation [19]. However, it
as been demonstrated that patients with nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease had higher MPV [26].

Magen et al. collected prospective data for 373 CSU
patients and 46 healthy controls, suggesting that increased
MPV may be an indicator for increased disease activity/severity in CSU patients with ASST-positive response,
but not in ASST-negative group [15]. In this study, antiTPO and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies were positive in
34.6% and 19.3% of patients with positive and 21.8% and
4% negative ASST, respectively [15]. Interestingly, it has
been demonstrated thatmean platelet volume (MPV) was
increased and correlated only with anti-thyroid peroxidase
(TPO) antibodies as well as MPV values were increased after
subclinical hypothyroidic patients became euthyroid [27, 28].
n contrast, we showed that MPV and PDW values did not
differ significantly between CSU patients, regardless of the
disease activity/severity and ASST response as well as when

 

 
compared with the healthy subjects. Our sample size was
smaller than that of Magen et al. [15]. In addition, our patient
had no thyroid antibodies and normal transaminases level
as compared with healthy subjects. However, in the previous
study the percentage of patients with thyroid autoimmunity
was similar in the CSU groups with positive and negative
response to ASST [15]. The reason for such discrepancy is
unclear and all our attempts of explanation have been merely
speculative.

The variances between the studies on platelet indices in
CSU may result from different criteria used to classify the
patients and/or from the technical reasons. Although results
of studies evaluating MPV and PDW in various diseases
point to some potential usefulness in the clinical practice,
there are several limitations which depend on the number
of technical criteria, including time and method of analysis,
or anticoagulant used [11]. In addition, the conflicting data
regarding MPV and PDW in CSU may be due to the failure
to rule out confounding factors (especially in retrospectives
analysis), including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, obesity, arterial diseases, and autoimmune diseases [2934]. Currently, almost all diseases may increase or decrease
MPV/PDW; therefore, it is difficult if not practically impossible to exclude all MPV-related diseases and conditions
35].

Since the conflicting data do exist, some extensive multicenter studies should be performed to resolve the controversy.

MPV and PDW, commonly used as a measure of
atelet size, indicate the rate of platelet production and
atelet activation. Increased MPV and PDW may indicate
enhanced platelet activation in CSU, which is in contrast
with previous observation regarding the systemic release of
atelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin, the indices of
atelet activation [18], and in agreement with the study
by Chandrashekar et al. [21]. Very importantly, both the
rothrombotic condition and the hypercoagulable state are
not the established features of CSU. It has been demonstrated that SCU is associated with activation of the extrinsic (tissue factor) pathway and fibrinolysis with no features of the intrinsic pathway activation and thrombophilia
36, 37].

The previous studies did not provide any information
regarding relationship between the platelet size indices and
CRP concentration in CSU patients. We found that MPV and
PDW did not correlate with serum CRP concentration in
CSU groups.

 

 

 

71. Limitations of the Analysis. The main limitation of our
study was the relatively small sample size which was due
to more homogeneous group of patients. Nevertheless, we
were able to detect some statistically significant differences in
platelet count, between CSU patients and the healthy subjects
as well as to detect an activity/severity-dependent diversity of
the platelet count.

The strength of our analysis was the consistent and
comparable group of CSU patients and the well-matched
controls.

7.2. Clinical Implications. MPV and PDW values were statistically similar between the healthy subjects and patients
with mild and moderate-severe CSU, effecting in failure to
detect patients with more severe symptoms. The platelet
count was higher in moderate-severe CSU patients, although
all values were found within the normal lab range. So far,
apart from CRP, none of the parameters seems effective and
reliable enough to distinguish more severe CSU from milder
CSU throughout numerous cases. Although the significance
of MPV and PDW, as an important predictor for many
diseases, is increasing, it is still the subject of debate and
relevant experience is scarce, especially in CSU. Comparison
of platelet size indices with other potential biomarkers is
needed to characterize comprehensively its potential use in
monitoring the CSU patients.

73. Conclusions. MPV and PDW values of symptomatic
patients with mild and moderate-severe CSU were not
markedly distinct from those of the control group. Moreover,
we found that MPV and PDW were not correlated with serum
CRP concentration in the groups. However, we found higher
platelet count in CSU patients with more severe disease
activity and a positive correlation between the platelet count
and serum CRP concentration. Therefore, we suggest that
acute phase response in CSU is associated with the increased
number of circulating platelets in patients with more severe
symptoms.

It seems that simple determination of the platelet size
indices is not a reliable indicator of CSU severity/activity and
appears useless as a confirmatory test for CRP.

However, due to the conflicting data regarding platelet
function/activation, it is needed to perform further investigations, comprising larger groups of patients in order to assess
the clinical usefulness and validity of the platelet count and
indices for evaluation of the disease activity/severity in CSU.
