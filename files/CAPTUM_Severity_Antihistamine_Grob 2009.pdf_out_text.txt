How to prescribe antihistamines for chronic idiopathic urticaria:

desloratadine daily vs PRN and quality of life

Background: Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) impairs quality of life (QoL).
Currently, no consensus exists regarding how second-generation Hj-antihistamines (proven to control CIU symptoms) should be taken long-term: as daily
treatment or only when symptoms return (PRN). We sought to determine which
regimen improves or better maintains QoL in CIU: desloratadine (DL) daily or
PRN.

Methods: Subjects with CIU initially responding to DL 5 mg/day for 4 weeks
were randomized for an additional 8 weeks, to DL 5 mg/day (arm 1: ‘continuous’, 2 = 46) or to DL only on days when urticarial wheals were present (arm 2:
“PRN”, = 60). To ensure blinding, treatment was presented in both arms as a
combination of daily treatment (arm 1: DL; arm 2: placebo), plus a “rescue”
tablet (arm 1: placebo; arm 2: DL) to be taken only in case of symptoms. The

Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is a dermatologic
disorder characterized by the spontaneous occurrence of
erythematous wheals and intense itch (pruritus), with or
without angioedema, every day or nearly every day for
2 6 weeks (1, 2). It affects between 0.1% and 3% of the
population in the United States and Europe (3, 4).

The impact of CIU on patients’ lives is often underappreciated, as disease severity assessments are traditionally based on such factors as threat to life and functional
disabilities (5, 6). However, the perceptions of patients
may differ significantly from those of their health care
providers. The concept of health-related quality of life
(QoL) refers to a patient’s perception of the impact of an
illness, including its treatment, on daily life (7). It
encompasses physical, emotional, and social well-being
and limitations of daily activities (8, 9).

The chronic discomfort, anxiety, social impairment,
and other consequences of wheals and pruritus (e.g. lack
of quality sleep, insomnia, irritability, and depression)
and the unpredictable, relapsing nature of CIU can
significantly affect patient QoL (5, 6, 10). O'Donnell et al.
(8) concluded that the overall QoL impact on patients

with CIU was as severe as that reported by patients with
ischemic heart disease. A more recent study found that
health status (i.e. physical functioning, bodily pain,
general health, and emotional well-being) and subjective
satisfaction with factors such as sleep, mood, self-confidence, work, eating behavior, and resistance to stress
were significantly lower in subjects with CIU compared
with those with respiratory allergy (11).

Subject-reported QoL is an important outcome in
clinical trials and is especially relevant when evaluating
the effectiveness of CIU treatment (6, 10). With CIU, as
there are no fixed lesions permitting standard measurements over time, patient perception and QoL assessment
may be more meaningful to physicians in determining
choice of therapy than a measure of the reduction in the
number and size of transient wheals that appear in
different places on the body (12).

Second-generation H,-antihistamines are first-line
treatment for CIU, based on their proven efficacy and
superior safety profile compared with first-generation
agents (10, 13). Desloratadine, a newer, nonsedating
oral antihistamine with potent peripheral H,-receptor

antagonism, has been shown to reduce pruritus and to
improve CIU-impaired QoL in several randomized,
placebo-controlled, 6-week clinical trials. Evidence of
the positive effects of desloratadine on QoL can be found
in a number of clinical trials that measured the drug’s
efficacy using the validated Dermatology Life Quality
Index (DLQIJ) and the VQ-Dermato assessment tools — as
well as in scores for total symptoms, pruritus, and
number and size of wheals (14-17).

Certain guidelines recommend continuous treatment
with antihistamines to achieve lasting and complete
remission of lesions, followed by discontinuation of
treatment (with dose tapering if necessary) (13). However,
there is a lack of published data regarding the best
treatment regimen to maintain therapeutic result once
CIU symptoms have been controlled initially with daily
continuous antihistamine treatment.

This study was thus designed to determine the best
strategy for prescribing antihistamines after a good initial
response: continuing daily antihistamine for a few months
or switching to a PRN regimen, using antihistamines only
when urticarial symptoms develop.

Methods
Objectives

In patients with CIU responding to a short-term course of daily
desloratadine therapy, the objective of this study was to determine
whether continuing daily desloratadine treatment or switching to a
PRN desloratadine regimen was the better method to maintain or
improve QoL in subjects with CIU.

Subjects

Subjects aged > 18 years, in general good health, and with a= 6-week
history of CIU (pruritus and wheals) prior to Visit 1 were eligible
for the study. Women of childbearing age had to be using an
acceptable form of contraception prior to enrolment. Subjects were
excluded from the study if they were pregnant or nursing, had
asthma requiring chronic inhaled or systemic corticosteroids, had
been injected with corticosteroids within 90 days of baseline, or
had been hospitalized for CIU within 3 months before Visit 1.
Treatment with investigational drugs was prohibited for 30 days
before Visit 1 or for 90 days in the case of investigational antibodies
for asthma or allergic rhinitis. Medications prohibited during the
study included corticosteroids, antihistamines, leukotriene inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tricyclic or tetracyclic
antidepressants, and histamine H>-receptor antagonists. Additional
reasons for exclusion were known hypersensitivity to desloratadine
or any of its excipients, treatment with immunosuppressive drugs,
clinically important systemic disease that might interfere with the
evaluation of CIU or compromise subject safety, the presence of
affective or intellectual disorders that might invalidate informed
consent and history of noncompliance with medications or treatment protocols.

Ethics approval was obtained from the Consultant Committee for
the Protection of Persons in Biomedical Research (Marseille,
France), and the trial was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent amend
606

ments and Good Clinical Practice principles. All subjects provided
written informed consent before study initiation.

Study design

This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted
in 35 centers in France. All subjects received desloratadine (Aerius;
Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ, USA) 5 mg once daily for
28 days (between Visits 1 and 2). Subjects responding to treatment
(no or only mild overall CIU) were randomized to two arms for
2 months (between Visits 2 and 4). Subjects in arm 1 received
desloratadine once daily (‘continuous treatment’), and those in arm
2 received desloratadine which was to be taken only when the
patients had urticarial wheals (PRN treatment’). To ensure blinding, we could not compare a treatment given daily and a treatment
only in case of symptoms. The treatment was thus presented to all
patients as a double prescription: one tablet, to be taken every day
in the evening, plus an additional tablet to be taken only in cases of
symptoms, presented as ‘rescue’ treatment. In arm | (n = 46), daily
treatment was desloratadine 5 mg once daily, and rescue treatment
was placebo. In arm 2 (n = 60), daily treatment was placebo, and
rescue treatment was desloratadine 5 mg. During a 2-month followup period (between Visits 4 and 5), all subjects received desloratadine 5 mg PRN for symptom relapse, with no scheduled daily dose
(Fig. 1).

One hundred twenty-nine subjects were enrolled in the study and
were included in the global population at Visit 1. Between Visits |
and 2, three subjects withdrew prematurely (two were lost to followup and one withdrew for personal reasons). Among the 126 subjects
in the global population at Visit 2 (prior to randomization), 15
‘nonresponders’ and five ‘responders’ were not randomized into the
comparative phase due to withdrawal from the study (m = 2),
adverse event (AE) (n = 1) or lack of treatment efficacy (n = 2),
leaving 106 randomized subjects as the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. In the ITT population, eight subjects withdrew during the
comparative phase with no final assessment, four had major protocol deviations, and three had missing values for the main evaluation criteria, leaving 91 subjects to comprise the per-protocol (PP)
population (Fig. 2).

At Visit 1, a clinical history, including a detailed account of
allergy and skin disease during the past 5 years and medications
taken to treat CIU outbreaks, was taken. Both investigators and
subjects evaluated the overall condition of the subjects’ CIU. At
Visit 2 (beginning of comparative phase), subjects who met the
efficacy criteria and responded to treatment were randomized 3 : 2
by computer-generated allocation code into the two treatment arms:

subjects in the desloratadine daily treatment group. Subjects recorded pruritus severity, rescue medication usage, changes in concomitant therapies, and any health-related events in daily diaries.
Beginning at Visit 4 (initiation of 2-month follow-up period), subjects noted use of desloratadine PRN. A virtual “Visit 4.1” included
data from all randomized subjects who continued until Visit 4 plus
subjects who withdrew from the study between Visits 2 and 4 and
who had a final evaluation performed at withdrawal. Visit 5 was the
last visit of the follow-up period.

Efficacy and safety assessments

The primary efficacy parameters were changes in the VQ-Dermato
and DLQI scores between Visits 2 and 4. These two dermatologyspecific QoL questionnaires were administered at Visits 1 through 4
to assess the effects of treatment on QoL. Both instruments have
been validated in subjects with CIU (12, 18, 19). The VQ-Dermato,
designed to assess QoL outcomes in French-speaking patients,
measures QoL of the preceding 4 weeks (12, 19). It comprises 28
items in 7 domains: self-perception, daily living activities, mood
state, social functioning, leisure activities, treatment-induced
restrictions and physical discomfort (12). Questions are weighted
equally, and each dimension score ranges from 0 (best QoL) to 100
(poorest QoL). An overall score (VQ-Dermato Global Index) can
be calculated from the 7 domains (19).

The DLQI measures QoL during the preceding 7 days and
comprises 10 equally weighted items that evaluate the impact of
dermatologic diseases on itchiness/soreness/pain, embarrassment,

interference with shopping, choice of clothing, social leisure, difficulty with sports, difficulty with work or study, problems with
partner, sexual difficulties, and problems at home due to treatment
(18). Individual items are scored on a scale of 0 (least impairment)
to 3 (worst impairment), with the total DLQI score ranging from 0
to 30 (higher score indicating greater QoL impairment) (18). For
this study, a validated French translation of the DLQI was used.
Secondary efficacy parameters for the randomization period
(Visits 2-4) included average use of rescue (PRN) desloratadine or
placebo, change in pruritus symptoms and in overall condition of
CIU, discontinuations due to treatment failure, investigator's
assessment of response to therapy, and quality of disease control. In
a separate assessment, both investigators and subjects used the
following scale to evaluate CIU overall condition: 0 = none (no
signs/symptoms were evident), | = mild (signs/symptoms were
clearly present but minimal awareness; easily tolerated),
2 = moderate (definite awareness of signs/symptoms; bothersome
but tolerable), and 3 = severe (signs/symptoms were hard to tolerate; interfered with activities of daily living and/or sleeping).
Responders were subjects with a score of 0 or 1. The evaluation of
overall condition included the entire time period since the preceding
visit or the 7 days before the first evaluation. Daily pruritus severity
was scored in subject diaries as no, light, moderate, or severe pruritus. Investigators assessed response to therapy at Visits 2 and 4,
based on the subjects’ condition at the time of evaluation compared
with their condition prior to starting treatment. A 5-point scale that
ranged from | = complete relief to 5 = treatment failure was utilized. Secondary efficacy parameters for the follow-up period (Visits
4-5) included disease-free period after 3 months of daily treatment
(from time of onset of first pruritus outbreak), the percentage of
subjects free of symptoms 2 months after Visit 4, and average
desloratadine rescue intake (time between Visit 4 and first date
subject noted desloratadine rescue intake in diary).
At each visit after Visit 1, investigators questioned and/or
examined subjects for evidence of AEs. The safety population included all subjects who received the study drug beginning at Visit 1.

Statistical analyses

For the randomized, comparative phase of the study (Visit 2-4),
both the ITT and PP populations were analyzed. The ITT population included all subjects randomized at Visit 2; the PP population
included all subjects randomized at Visit 2 for whom a final evaluation was performed and who had no major protocol deviations
between Visits 2 and 4. The changes in scores between visits for the
PP population were standardized with the following formulas to
take into account the different levels of QoL at randomization:

Data were analyzed using sas software (version 8.2). For all tests,
the « risk was set to 0.05, and a 2-sided approach was used. For
multiple testing, Bonferroni’s corrections were performed. Qualitative variables were frequency, percentage, and 95% confidence
interval (CI), and quantitative data were described by
mean + standard deviation (SD) and 95% CI.

Changes from Visit 2 to Visit 4 in VQ-Dermato and DLQI scores,
the overall condition of CIU, pruritus symptoms, and the investigator’s assessment of response to therapy were assessed using the
Mann-Whitney test. A Student’s ¢ test was used to compare average
PRN medication use and average treatment consumption between
Visits 2 and 5 among treatment groups. The percentage of symptom-free subjects 2 months after Visit 4, quality of disease control,
and discontinuations due to treatment failure were compared between groups using the Chi-square test. Finally, the disease-free
period after 3 months of daily treatment was estimated using the
Kaplan—Meier method, and between-group comparisons were made
using the log-rank test.

Results
Baseline characteristics

In the global population at Visit 1 (N = 129), the mean
age was 43.6 + 13.7 years, 63.6% of subjects were
female, and 69% had a CIU duration of <5 years.
Nearly 52% were treated with antihistamines; 53.5% had
moderate CIU, and 21.7% of subjects had severe CIU.
Compared with the randomized population (n = 106) at
Visit 2, nonresponders (n = 15) were older, had a longer
duration and greater severity of CIU, and were less likely
to have been treated with antihistamines.

At Visit 1, the 2 randomized treatment groups in the
ITT population were comparable in demographic and
clinical characteristics (Table 1). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups for
the scores of any individual item on the VQ-Dermato or
the DLQI at Visit 1.

Efficacy analyses

VQ-Dermato. In the ITT population, daily desloratadine
therapy led to statistically significant improvements in the

compared with desloratadine PRN: P = 0.001 at Visit 3,
P = 0.016 at Visit 4, and P = 0.034 at Visit 4.1 (Fig. 3).
Results for the PP population are shown in Table 2.

The QoL dimensions with a statistically significant
difference in favor of desloratadine daily vs desloratadine
PRN at Visits 3 and 4 were daily living activity
(P = 0.005 and P = 0.007, respectively), mood state
(P = 0.003 and P = 0.005, respectively), and social
functioning (P = 0.040 and P = 0.044, respectively).
A similar significant difference was noted at Visit 3 for
physical discomfort (P = 0.002) (Fig. 4). Results in the
PP population were similar to those in the ITT population for Visits 3 and 4, except for physical discomfort, for
which no significant difference appeared between groups
at Visit 4.

DLQI. In the ITT population, significant improvements
in the DLQI score were seen in the desloratadine daily
group vs the desloratadine PRN group at Visit 3
(P = 0.001). This difference was not significant at Visit
4 (Table 3). Similar observations were noted for the PP
population (Table 2);

Secondary efficacy analyses during the randomized treatment period (2 months between Visits 2 and 4). Subjects
taking desloratadine daily had a significantly lower mean
number of days with moderate or severe pruritus (than
those taking desloratadine PRN [6.3 + 9.6 vs
12.7 + 13.3 days, respectively; P = 0.012)]). The CIU
score increased (worsened) in the desloratadine PRN
group by 0.23 + 0.7 and remained unchanged in the
desloratadine daily group, but this difference was not
statistically significant. Treatment failure (measured by
use of prohibited medications) was reported in two
subjects in the desloratadine PRN group but in no
subject in the desloratadine daily group. At Visit 4, there
was a trend toward more subjects given desloratadine
daily achieving complete relief [m = 21; 52.5% (95% CI:
36.1-68.5%)] than those given desloratadine PRN
[n = 16; 30.8% (95% CI: 18.7-45.1%; P = 0.097)].

Secondary efficacy analyses during the follow-up period
(2 months between Visits 4 and 5). There was no
statistically significant difference in the median time to
onset of the first moderate or severe pruritus event
between subjects given desloratadine PRN (4 days) and
subjects given desloratadine daily (3 days). Between Visits
4 and 5, when all subjects received desloratadine only for
symptom relapse, the CIU score decreased (improved) in
the group that had previously received desloratadine
PRN (-0.22 + 0.62) and increased (worsened) in the
group that had previously received desloratadine daily
(0.21 + 1.13; P = 0.037). Among the ITT population,
77.2% of subjects (n = 68), including 71.4% (n = 35) in
the PRN group and 84.6% (n = 33) in the daily group
took desloratadine rescue medication during the followup period. The median time to rescue-desloratadine

Safety

No serious AEs occurred during the study period. Among
the global population (VN = 129), 41 subjects (31.8%)
reported at least one AE. Among the randomized
population, 35 subjects (33%) — 19 in the desloratadine
PRN group and 16 in the desloratadine daily group —
experienced AEs. The most frequent AEs reported among
the randomized population were nasopharyngitis (6.7%)
and headache (5.7%). Adverse events prompted three
withdrawals from the study prior to randomization (one
for ‘aggravated condition’ considered unlikely due to
study drug; one for malaise/dizziness, nausea, fatigue,
and decreased vigilance; and one for weight gain, both
considered probably related to study drug).

Discussion

Most therapeutic CIU trials have studied short-term
efficacy, and no evidence-based information about the
best way to use antihistamines in the long-term management of this chronic disease had been previously
published. This study is the first to assess how the secondgeneration antihistamine desloratadine should be administered over the long-term course of chronic CIU. These
results, although limited to desloratadine, may be applicable to other second-generation antihistamines; however, differences in the pharmacology of various
antihistamines may lead to results different from those
of the current study (20, 21).

Our study is also the second controlled trial to use QoL
as the main outcome measure (22). Quality-of-life measures are particularly relevant in assessing the results of
CIU treatment because they provide a comprehensive
evaluation of the impact of the disease and its treatment

from the patient’s perspective. New guidelines from the
dermatology section of the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology and the Global Allergy
and Asthma European Network note that health-related
QoL should be used as a primary outcome measure in
clinical trials (10). An increasing amount of clinical
evidence has shown that from the patient’s perspective,
the negative impact of CIU on QoL is similar to or
greater than that of other, more severe, chronic dermatologic disorders, such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis
(5, 6, 8, 11, 19).

General measures of health status and health-related
QoL (e.g. the Nottingham Health Profile and the Medical
Outcomes Study Short Form 36) are useful for comparing
QoL impairment across different conditions, but they do
not address areas of relevance to particular diseases (6,
12). Disease-specific QoL instruments are more sensitive
to changes and are therefore more useful in evaluating the
impact of treatments (6). The psychometric properties of
QoL instruments are intrinsic to the language and culture
of the populations in which they were created and
validated (6). The choice of an instrument for a given
purpose in a specific population is a key issue. Therefore,
we used two instruments specific for skin disorders, a
French translation of the DLQI and the VQ-Dermato,
which was validated in a French population.

Second-generation H,-antihistamines such as desloratadine have proven efficacy in reducing the CIU symptoms
of pruritus and wheal and flare. In three randomized,
placebo-controlled studies, daily treatment with desloratadine 5 mg significantly reduced the detrimental impact
of CIU on daily activities and sleep (14-16). This in turn
led to improved QoL, as measured by the DLQI (14, 15,
17) or a 5-question shortened version of the DLQI (23).
Increased QoL in CIU has also been demonstrated with
other second-generation antihistamines (22, 24, 25).
However, most therapeutic trials using H,-antihistamines
have only addressed short-term efficacy, even though
CIU is a chronic disease which has to be managed over
the long-term. Our study was designed to provide health
care providers with information adapted for the chronic
nature of CIU.

In this study, there was a significant advantage of daily
treatment of CIU with desloratadine over PRN usage in
maintaining the QoL benefit achieved after an initial
month of daily desloratadine treatment indeed at the end
of the first month of randomized treatment the advantage was demonstrated in terms of changes in the
VQ-Dermato Global Index scores and in several individual dimension scores (i.e. daily living activity, mood state,
social functioning, and physical discomfort). The differences were still significant at the end of the second month.
The DLQI results confirmed these findings, although the
difference detected by the DLQI at the end of the first
month was no longer significant at the end of the second
month of randomized treatment.

Second-generation antihistamines offer an advantage to
physicians and patients concerned with improving overall
QoL. These agents have a lower propensity to cross
the blood-brain barrier, and, therefore, some such as
desloratadine, have rates of somnolence and anticholinergic effects similar to that of placebo. In our study, only
one subject withdrew for reasons of decreased vigilance
possibly as a result of desloratadine treatment. However,

the most frequently reported AEs were nasopharyngitis
and headache, which did not prompt withdrawal from the
study. No severe AEs or deaths were reported.

For reasons of considerable initial improvement in
both VQ-Dermato and DLQI scores after the first month
of treatment (randomization), no major improvements
were expected after randomization; only decreases, maintenance, or slight improvements in QoL were expected to
occur. However, both instruments showed statistically
significant differences in scores in the desloratadine daily
treatment group vs the desloratadine PRN group. The
benefit at Visits 4 and 4.1 was significant only with the
VQ-Dermato, which showed that this instrument was
more sensitive to minor changes in QoL than the DLQI.

The VQ-Dermato is the first reliable dermatologyspecific QoL instrument generated and validated in
France (12). The DLQI was generated and validated in
the United Kingdom; its French translation has been
cross-validated. The higher sensitivity of the VQ-Dermato
may be because it was developed and validated in
the culture and population in which the current trial
was conducted, in addition to its greater number of
questions.

The superiority of desloratadine daily treatment, as
shown by the two QoL instruments, was confirmed by the
results of secondary analyses using other criteria. Subjects
in the daily treatment group experienced fewer days with
moderate or severe pruritus, had a higher percentage of
complete relief at the end of the randomized treatment
period, and were less likely to use rescue medication.

Desloratadine daily vs PRN for improving QoL in CIU

After Visit 4, when all subjects took desloratadine
PRN, there was an apparently paradoxical worsening of
QoL in those who had taken desloratadine daily vs an
improvement in those who had taken desloratadine PRN.
This may be explained by the fact that a subject’s
estimation of his QoL is relative to his previous status. In
subjects previously under continuous treatment, taking a
medication PRN can be viewed as a worsening compared
with the previous better control of CIU, while subjects
already under a PRN regimen may tend to adapt better to
incomplete disease control results over time.

Conclusion

This randomized study of desloratadine, with QoL as a
main outcome measure, demonstrated that once control
of CIU symptoms is obtained with daily treatment,
continuous therapy (whether or not the patient is showing
symptoms) preserves patient QoL better over the long
term as compared with than PRN treatment only given
only at symptom flare-up. The results provide useful
therapeutic information to help physicians manage their
patients with CIU.
