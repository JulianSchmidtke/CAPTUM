Abstract

Background: Patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) have been reported to experience increased disease activity in response to the oral intake of hot pepper (Capsicum spp.). As of now, it is unclear how common this is.

Objective: We assessed patients with CSU for the prevalence of disease worsening after the intake of hot pepper and characterized its effects on their urticaria.

Methods: A questionnaire-based survey study in adult patients with CSU and a history of hot pepper consumption was
carried out at a reference center for urticaria in Turkey. CSU patients who had co-existing chronic inducible urticaria were
excluded from the study.

Results: Of the eighty-five patients with CSU included in this study, 46% (39 of 85) reported worsening of their urticaria
after consuming hot pepper. Demographic features, duration of CSU and control status of urticaria were not different
between patients who experienced worsening of their urticaria after the intake of hot pepper and those who did not. In
affected patients, worsening of their symptoms started 1.2 + 1.2 hours after the intake of hot pepper and lasted for 3.3 +
6.8 hours. Symptoms disappeared significantly faster in patients who took antihistamines after worsening of their urticaria
with hot pepper (0.7 + 0.6 vs. 5.8 + 8.8 hours; p = 0.003).

Conclusions: Worsening of urticaria is common and relevant in patients with CSU in Turkey. Further studies are needed
to explore if this is also the case in other geographical regions and to identify and characterize the underlying mechanisms.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common and
debilitating skin disorder characterized by recurrent transient
and itchy wheals (hives), angioedema, or both for more than
6 weeks.’ The signs and symptoms of CSU result from the
degranulation of skin mast cells and the release of histamine
and other pro-inflammatory mediators. Most CSU patients
have mast cell-activating IgG auto-antibodies and/or IgE
auto-antibodies, which are held to be involved in the degranulation of their skin mast cells.** Chronic infections, drugs,
food intolerance and stress can lead to increased disease
activity in CSU patients,*° although the precise mechanisms
are unclear. One possible explanation for this is that mast cell

activators linked to these conditions such as complement components or neuropeptides decrease the degranulation threshold of skin mast cells. Alternatively, these signals, alone or in
combination, may directly degranulate skin mast cells. Either
way, further research is needed to clarify the complex pathogenesis of CSU and to identify and characterize its various
aspects.'°

The notion that several neuropeptides such as substance P
are involved in the pathogenesis of CSU is supported by several independent lines of evidence.” Stress can exacerbate CSU,
and stress is linked to the release of substance P by cutaneous sensory nerves.* In the skin, mast cells and sensory nerve

endings are in close anatomical relation and interact with
each other by several mediators including substance P. Substance P can degranulate skin mast cells and alter their threshold to activation.'"” The release of histamine, tryptase, IL-31
and leukotrienes from mast cells induces the release of neuropeptides from skin nerves, which creates a positive feedback mechanism for further mast cell activation.’ Activated
skin mast cells can release substance P, which increases this
feedback even more.'*"” Patients with CSU have increased
responsiveness to neuropeptides.''!* Substance P has been
shown to be elevated in patients with CSU, and substance
P levels are linked to CSU disease activity.’ As of now, however, there is no direct evidence that neuropeptides contribute to the pathogenesis of CSU, and their role and relevance
in the development of urticaria signs and symptoms remains
unclear.

Capsaicin, the natural pungent in hot pepper (Capsicum
spp.),°° acts on transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)
receptors on sensory nerves and induces the release of substance P and other neuropeptides.”’” Activation of TRPV1
receptors on sensory nerves is responsible for the burning
sensation that occurs upon skin and mucosal contact with
capsaicin.” Cases of increased disease activity in patients with
CSU following oral intake of hot pepper have been reported.”
As of now, it is unclear how common this is, and the effects
of hot pepper consumption in patients with CSU remain ill
characterized. Therefore, in this study, we assessed CSU patients for the effects of intake of hot pepper on their disease.
Specifically, we determined the prevalence of hot pepperinduced worsening of CSU. We did this for two reasons. First,
we wanted to provide, for the first time, data that can help to
counsel CSU patients on the risk of worsening of their CSU
after hot pepper consumption. Second, oral provocation
with hot pepper may serve, in future studies in selected patients, as a model for the induction of CSU symptoms and the
investigation of its underlying mechanisms and the effects of
treatment.

Patients and Methods
Patients and study conduct

This was a questionnaire-based survey study that was carried out at the urticaria reference center of Erciyes University,
Allergy-Immunology Clinic, Turkey during May and August
2018. We included 85 consecutive eligible patients admitted
to the outpatient clinic of our center. Inclusion criteria included 1) diagnosis of CSU, 2) hot pepper consumption history
during CSU, 3) informed consent, and 4) age of 18 years or
older. CSU patients who had co-existing chronic inducible urticaria (as diagnosed by a positive history of physical triggers
confirmed with provocation testing) or a history of anaphylaxis after intake of hot pepper were excluded from the study.
This study was approved by the institutional ethical committee
(Erciyes University Medical Ethical Committee, decision no:
2018/541).

Disease control and treatment history
Disease control was measured either with the urticaria control test (UCT = 12 defined as controlled-disease) or in-clinic

UAS with regard to the preceding day (range 0-6, UAS < 1 defined as controlled-disease).””° Treatment history of the patients was obtained from the questionnaire and/or the clinical
charts.

Assessment of the effects of hot pepper intake

The effects of consuming hot pepper were assessed retrospectively, by the use of a questionnaire that consisted of 16
questions that focused on CSU disease activity, clinical manifestation and impact. Worsening of urticaria was defined as
either 1) the development of novel urticarial signs and symptoms or 2) substantial worsening of existing signs and symptoms of CSU, within 3 hours after hot pepper intake. If a
patient reported worsening of urticaria at least once after hot
pepper intake at anytime, they were asked about 1) which
urticarial signs and symptoms worsened (itch, wheals, angioedema, and burning sensation), 2) the reproducibility of
this response (every time, sometimes, rarely after hot pepper
intake), 3) the amount of hot pepper intake that led to worsening of urticaria (low, high), 4) the elapsed time from hot
pepper intake to the beginning of the signs and symptoms,
5) antihistamine use after worsening of urticaria, 6) elapsed
time for the resolution of the symptoms (with/without antihistamines), and 7) possible other similar triggers. Also, patients
who reported worsening of their urticaria after hot pepper
intake were asked to compare the severity of signs and symptoms before and after hot pepper intake and to quantify this
change with the help of a numerical rating scale (NRS) from 1
(very minor change in the severity of signs and symptoms) to 10
(extreme change in the severity of signs and symptoms).

 

 

Statistics

Data were entered into Statistical Package for Social Sciences software version 17.0 (SPSS Inc.; Chicago, IL, USA), and
analyses were made using the same software program. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to compute the distribution of
numerical variables; parametric variables were presented as
mean + standard deviation and non-parametric variables were
presented as median (interquartile range). When comparing
continuous variables, an independent sample t test was used for
parametric values and the Mann-Whitney U test for non-parametric values. Chi-square test was used to for the comparison of
categorical variables. p < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
Patient characteristics and treatment history

Sixty-two (73%) of the 85 patients with CSU included in
this study were female, the mean age was 39.1 + 11.9 (Table 1).
Four patients had co-existing atopic disease, and 6 had a comorbid autoimmune disease. The mean duration of urticaria
was 3.9 + 4.4 years. Seventy-three (89%) of patients were on
active treatment for their CSU at the time of the study; 31 patients (38%) received standard dosed sgAHs, 18 patients (22%)
were on higher than standard-dosed sgAHs, and 24 patients
(29%) received omalizumab. At the time of study, 75% (55 of
73) of the patients who were treated with any of these treatment options and none of the patients without any treatment
had controlled-disease (UCT = 12 and/or in-clinic UAS < 1).

Worsening of urticaria with hot pepper is frequent in patients
with CSU

Almost half of our patients (39 of 85, 46%) reported worsening of their urticaria after consuming hot pepper. The demographic features, duration of CSU and control status of urticaria
were not different between patients who reported worsening
of their urticaria after the intake of hot pepper and those who
did not (Table 1). The signs and symptoms of CSU that were
most commonly induced or exacerbated after hot pepper intake were itchy wheals without angioedema (77%), followed by
wheals with angioedema (3.5%), and angioedema only (2.4%).
In addition, almost half of our patients (49%) experienced a
burning sensation of the skin after hot pepper consumption.
Fourteen patients with worsening of their urticaria after hot
pepper intake reported similar worsening of urticaria with
other spices. The mean increase in the severity of signs and
symptoms after hot pepper intake was 3.9 + 2.2 points on the
10 point NRS.

Worsening of urticaria with hot pepper is relevant in patients
with CSU

Most patients with worsening of CSU after hot pepper
intake (28 of 39, 72%) reported that this happens every time
they eat hot pepper, whereas only 10 (25.6%) and one (2.6%)
patient reported that this happens only sometimes and rarely
after consuming hot pepper, respectively.

Most of the patients with worsening of CSU after hot pepper intake reported that low amounts of pepper were sufficient
to worsen their disease. Only 9 of 39 intolerant CSU patients
(23.1%) reported worsening of the symptoms only when consuming high amounts of hot pepper. Twenty-four of the 28
CSU patients, who had worsening of symptoms every time after

hot pepper intake, reported that even low amounts of hot pepper was enough for this to happen (Figure 1).

Figure 3. In the skin, mast cells and sensory nerve endings are in close anatomical relation and interact with each other by
several mediators. Most of these mediators’ receptors have downstream signals ending with activation of transient receptor
potential channels. Capsaicin acts on TRPV1 channels on sensory nerves and induces the release of neuropeptides. Although
it was shown that TRPV1 is also expressed on skin mast cells, it is still unknown whether capsaicin may directly stimulate skin
mast cells.

Worsening of urticaria with hot pepper responds well to antihistamines

Worsening of urticaria in affected patients started 1.2 + 1.2
hours after the intake of hot pepper and lasted for 3.3 + 6.8
hours. Twenty-one patients reported that they used additional
AHs besides their regular treatments to treat the worsening of
their urticaria, whereas 14 patients did not. The mean increase
in the severity of signs and symptoms after hot pepper intake
were similar in both groups (4 + 2.1 vs. 3.9 + 2.1 NRS points,
p = 0.99); however, symptoms disappeared significantly faster
in patients who took AHs as compared to those who did not
(0.7 + 0.6 vs. 5.8 + 8.8 hours; p = 0.003) (Figure 2).

Discussion

In this study, we found that one of two patients with CSU
who consume hot pepper, experience worsening of their urticaria after doing so. This was largely independent of the amount
of hot pepper consumed and responded well to antihistamines.

Adverse reactions and intolerance to foods are frequently
described by patients with CSU. Sanchez et al showed that
66% of CSU patients reported at least one adverse reaction to
foods.* They also found that 29% and 22% of the patients self
reported exacerbation of CSU after eating sauces and spicy
foods, respectively. In our study, 46% (39 of 85) of the patients
reported worsening of urticaria after hot pepper intake. More
importantly, 24 of them reported worsening of urticaria every
time they consumed hot pepper, even with low amounts.

At present, we can only speculate on the underlying mechanisms of worsening of urticaria in CSU patients after the
intake of hot pepper. Previous studies revealed that food-induced urticarial reactions in patients with CSU are rarely IgEmediated, as shown by the absence of specific IgE or negative
skin prick tests.%?”7 As we did not perform hot pepper skin
prick tests or measurements of specific IgE, the mechanism of
hot pepper-induced exacerbation of urticaria in our patients
remains to be clarified. Our patients did not have a history of
prior allergic reactions to hot pepper and showed occurrence
of urticarial symptoms without hot pepper intake, which argues against hot pepper allergy and suggests that patients
who had worsening of urticaria after hot pepper intake had a
non-IgE-mediated reaction to hot pepper.

The most likely explanation, from our point of view, is that
hot pepper acts as an aggravating factor that induces the degranulation of skin mast cells and/or decreases their degranulation threshold.”**

Hot pepper contains high amounts of capsaicin,” an irritant that produces a burning sensation upon skin and mucosal
contact. The most frequent adverse effects of treatment with
topical capsaicin formulations are application-site burning,
pain, erythema and itch.” These effects of capsaicin are held
to be due to the release of neuropeptides like substance P??
from sensory nerves via the activation of TRPV1 channels,
which are also expressed on mast cells. Sensory nerves of the
skin, via release of substance P and other mechanisms, can
induce the degranulation of skin mast cells and alter their
activation threshold (Figure 3).'°*° Interestingly, several cases
of urticarial skin reactions, ie. wheal development, to direct
and prolonged contact with hot pepper have been reported.*!*

APJAI

In our study, the development of wheals in response to hot
epper consumption was experienced by 4 of 5 pepper-intolerant patients with CSU.

This study has some limitations: First, its results may be
affected by its single center nature. The consumption of hot
epper and the frequency of hot pepper intolerance may be
different in other geographical regions with different dietary
habits. Also, patients without hot pepper intolerance may have
been unwilling to consent and participate in this study, thereby
introducing a selection bias. Finally, in this study, we did not
erform double blind placebo-controlled oral challenge tests
with hot pepper to confirm the patient-reported information
obtained. We are planning to do this in future studies.

In conclusion, hot pepper-driven worsening of urticaria is
common and relevant in patients with chronic spontaneous
urticaria who consume hot pepper. Further studies should
confirm this finding in larger and ideally global patient populations and address the underlying mechanisms. Our results
should encourage physicians who treat patients with CSU
to make them aware of the possibility that the intake of hot
pepper can aggravate their urticaria and to advise them to
abstain from its consumption if it does. Also, standardized
oral provocation tests with hot pepper or capsaicin, in patients
with CSU and a history of hot pepper-induced worsening of
urticaria, may be a suitable model to test the efficacy of novel
treatment options in preventing CSU exacerbations.
