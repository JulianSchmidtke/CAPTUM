Abstract

Background: The Helicobacter pylori infection is linked to
chronic urticaria in nearly 60% of patients. We studied clinicoepidemiologic features in patients with chronic urticaria
with and without H. pylori infection. Methods: Endoscopic
antral biopsy for the rapid urease test (RUT) and histopathology, and serum IgG ELISA for H. pylori infection were performed in 150 patients (male:female ratio 1:2.4) of chronic
urticaria aged 18-68 years. Clinicoepidemiologic features including age, gender, age of onset and duration, frequency
and distribution of wheals, urticaria severity score, and systemic symptoms were analyzed in patients with and without
H. pylori. The results of serum IgG ELISA for H. pylori were
compared with 106 age- and gender-matched healthy adult
controls, Results: The RUT in 84 patients (56%), histopathology in 76 patients (50.6%), and H. pylori |gG ELISA in 94 patients (62.6%) were positive. H. pylori IgG ELISA was positive
only in 35 (33%) controls, suggesting that chronic urticaria
patients were more likely to have asymptomatic H. pylori in
fection than normal controls. Although not statistically significant, patients with H. pylori had a higher mean urticaria
severity score, number of urticaria/angioedema episodes
per year, and involvement of more body sites, particularly
the scalp, palms, and soles. The constitutional or gastrointestinal symptoms were statistically higher in patients with H.
pylori infection than those without it. Conclusion: A subset
of chronic urticaria patients appears to have asymptomatic
H. pylori infection. However, its implications in chronicity, recurrences, the severity of urticaria, other systemic manifestations, and management remains conjectural in view of 33%
of controls also having positive H. pylori ELISA and the endemicity of infection in developing countries.

cantly affects quality of life. It affects women more often
than men and usual onset is between 20 and 40 years of
age [1-3]. Its etiology often remains unestablished despite extensive investigative workup rendering causespecific management difficult. Foods, drugs, inhalants,
systemic diseases, autoimmunity, and stress have frequently been implicated [4]. Focal bacterial and viral and
parasitic infections have also been implicated at a rate as
high as 43% of urticaria patients, and treating them empirically remains an unsubstantiated method in urticaria
management [5, 6]. Helicobacter pylori infection has also
been linked to chronic urticaria wherein it has been implicated in 60% of chronic urticaria patients in one study,
while associated gastritis was present in about 71% of 68
patients in another study [7-9]. Although it may not establish a causal relationship, H. pylori eradication treatment leads to the remission of urticaria in up to 80% of
patients, including antihistamine-unresponsive cases [7,
9-13]. A recent meta-analysis of studies comparing the
prevalence of H. pylori infection in chronic urticaria patients and controls suggested that H. pylori infection is
significantly, though weekly, associated with an increased
risk of chronic urticaria [14]. In contrast, studies have
found that evidence for a reported benefit of H. pylori
eradication was weak and conflicting, eradication therapy
may itself trigger urticaria, and the stated benefits might
have been from eradication of other undiagnosed/asymptomatic infections [15, 16].

Various mechanisms have been speculated to explain
the possible association of H. pylori with chronic urticaria [9-11, 16-18]. H. pylori is suggested to increase the secretion of gastric acid and pepsin, which induces active
inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract leading to the
recruitment of neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes, which release a family of histamine-releasing factors that induce mast cell degranulation. This might also
facilitate the absorption of antigens or unmasking of existing antigens triggering urticaria. H. pylori as an antigen
may also induce the expression of certain epitopes on endothelial cell adhesion molecules. H. pylori is also speculated to produce IgE antibodies by its cross-reaction with
parietal cells that may encourage the release of histamine
in the skin, causing wheal formation [2, 19]. The antibodies (IgG, IgA) also demonstrated against 19-kDa H. pylori protein probably contribute to the pathogenesis of
chronic urticaria by excessive consumption of complement. Juhlin [20] suggested that impairment of both food
processing and mucosal barrier function of the alimentary tract due to H. pylori infection perhaps creates conditions for food allergens to enter the blood stream facili

tated by inflammatory lesions of the intestinal tract. However, its significance in severity, recurrences, and
chronicity of urticaria remains uncertain and lacks consensus in general as H. pylori is also considered to be gastrointestinal commensal, and prevalence did not differ
from that of control groups in some of the studies [2125]. We performed this study with the objective of studying clinicoepidemiologic features in patients with chronic urticaria with or without H. pylori infection. The information will have a bearing on prescriptions of antihistamines in super pharmacologic doses or other immunemodulating drugs in the long-term management of urticaria, as their use based on clinical symptoms alone may
sometimes be considered unjustified.

Materials and Methods

One hundred and fifty patients (male:female ratio 43:107) aged
18-68 years with chronic urticaria, and 106 age- and gendermatched healthy adult controls (male:female ratio 31:75) not on
any medication were studied during April 2015 and March 2016.
Patients with physical urticaria, urticarial vasculitis, acute urticaria, concomitant medical and surgical diseases contraindicating upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, treatment with proton pump inhibitors/antibiotics in the preceding 4 weeks, as well as pregnant
or lactating women were excluded from the study. Subjects with
systemic diseases/infections known to cause urticaria and physical
urticaria were excluded by detailed clinical history/examinations,
provocation tests, and other relevant investigations, such as complete hemogram, thyroid and hepatorenal function tests, fasting
blood glucose estimation, ASO titer, rheumatoid factor, HbsAg,
urinalysis, and stool microscopy for ova/cysts. The urticaria activity was graded as mild, moderate, and severe on the basis of the
modified urticaria activity score (UAS; Table 1) [26]. An episode
of urticaria was defined as several days of urticaria signs and symp

scalp in all 4 groups. The involvement of the scalp, mouth,
tongue, palms, and soles was less frequent in group D patients by comparison. The mean UAS values (5.31 + 1.65,

Discussion

The demographic profile of the 150 patients in this
study corroborates with descriptions in the dermatology
literature [1-3]. An etiopathogenetic link between H. pylori infection and chronic urticaria and possible improvements after its eradication has been demonstrated. Chiu
et al. [27] studied 25 patients with chronic urticaria and
detected H. pylori in 14 (56%) patients, suggesting its possible role in the course of chronic urticaria irrespective of
different virulent genotypes. Sadighha et al. [9] noted that
IgG antibodies against H. pylori were positive in 74.6% of
75 chronic urticaria patients as compared to 56% of the
control group. Valsecchi and Pigatto [17] reported a high
prevalence of H. pylori infection in chronic urticaria patients by circulating IgG antibodies against the bacterium
and positive urea breath tests in 62% of cases. In our
study, RUT was positive in 84 patients (56%), histopathology in 76 (50.6%), and H. pylori IgG ELISA in 94
(62.6%). In comparison, H. pylori IgG ELISA was positive
in only 35 controls (33%), suggesting that the chronic urticaria patients were more likely to harbor H. pylori infection than normal controls (OR 3.39, 95% CI 2.15-5.76).
However, the significance of H. pylori in etiopathogenesis
or severity of chronic urticaria remains debatable. The
severity of urticaria varies and is often more severe in patients with H. pylori infection and said to improve or
show a better therapeutic response to antihistamines after
eradication therapy. However, researchers have also
shown no significant etiologic correlation between the
two, or therapeutic improvement of urticarial symptoms
following eradication therapy [21-24]. Abdou et al. [10]
assessed the prevalence of H. pylori infection in 35 patients of chronic urticaria and 10 normal control subjects.
They did not find a statistically significant difference for
the presence of H. pylori in the 2 groups (57 vs. 40%).
Nevertheless, the severity of urticarial symptoms was
greater in 20 H. pylori-positive patients than in 15 H. pylori-negative patients. We also made similar observations
wherein it was noted that of 133 patients with a moderate
UAS (3-5) to severe UAS (6-7), 109 (81.95%) were positive for H. pylori and had a greater mean number of episodes per year of urticaria and/or angioedema and sites
involved when compared with group D patients. However, a greater number (96 vs. 15) of patients with positive
test results had a significantly higher (p < 0.05) mean
number of systemic symptoms than patients with negative results. Furthermore, the prevalence of H. pylori-associated gastrointestinal symptoms remains variable,
from being symptomatic to the complete absence of

symptoms [2, 8, 10, 28]. In their 57% urticaria patients
with positive H. pylori, Abdou et al. [10] reported no gastric symptoms. In contrast, Wedi et al. [8] noted a high
prevalence of H. pylori gastritis and 47% of patients
showed elevated H. pylori-specific IgA and/or IgG antibodies. In our 126 patients with positive H. pylori tests,
only 41 (32.5%) had gastrointestinal symptoms, such as
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or indigestion, while the majority (85, 67.5%) were completely asymptomatic, making the clinical detection of this infection difficult. Overall, the urticaria activity was higher
with a statistically significant association of systemic
symptoms and involvement of the scalp, palms, and soles
in patients with H. pylori infection compared to patients
without it.

Limitations

The cross-sectional nature of study and absence of assessment of urticaria activity after H. pylori eradication
are the main limitations of this study. Also, the control
group could not be subjected to endoscopy for RUT and
histopathologic analysis. The worldwide endemic nature
of H. pylori infection, particularly in developing countries
with a low socioeconomic status, poor sanitation and water hygiene, and overcrowding remains another confounding factor.

Conclusion

A subset of patients with chronic urticaria possibly
harbors asymptomatic H. pylori infection. How it influences the chronicity, recurrences, severity, or other manifestations of urticaria/angioedema, and its remission after eradication therapy, remains conjectural given that
33% of controls were also H. pylori ELISA-positive and
the high endemicity of infection in developing countries
in general. More systematic and better-designed future
studies with a large number of patients and long-term
follow-up may perhaps resolve some of these issues.
