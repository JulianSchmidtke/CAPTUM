What is already known about this topic? Omalizumab is safe and efficacious in the treatment of chronic idiopathic
urticaria/chronic spontaneous urticaria (CIU/CSU). Different background therapies were used in the 3 phase III clinical

trials in patients with refractory CIU/CSU.

What does this article add to our knowledge? Findings from this post hoc analysis indicate similar efficacy with

omalizumab 300 mg in patients with CIU/CSU regardless of the background therapy for urticaria. The safety profile was
similar to that in allergic asthma.

How does this study impact current management guidelines? The study results support the use of omalizumab in
refractory patients with CIU/CSU without concerns for previous background therapies. No dose-related adverse effects
and no new safety concerns have been identified with the pooled data set.

 

BACKGROUND: Data from the 3 omalizumab pivotal trials in
patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria/chronic spontaneous
urticaria (CIU/CSU) represent the largest database of patients
reported to date with refractory disease (omalizumab, n = 733;
placebo, n = 242).

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare results
from ASTERIA I and II, which included only approved doses of
H, antihistamine as background therapy based on regulatory
authority requirements, to those from GLACIAL, which

other endpoints were also evaluated. Safety data were pooled
from all 3 studies.

RESULTS: Mean ISS was significantly reduced from baseline at
week 12 in the pooled ASTERIA I and II omalizumab 150- and
300-mg treatment arms and in the GLACIAL omalizumab 300mg arm. The weekly ISS reduction magnitude at week 12 was
similar between the omalizumab 300-mg groups in the
ASTERIA I and II pooled and GLACIAL studies. Similar treatment effect sizes were observed across multiple endpoints.
Omalizumab was well tolerated and the adverse-event profile was
similar regardless of background therapy for CIU/CSU. The
overall safety profile was generally consistent with omalizumab
therapy in allergic asthma.

CONCLUSION: Omalizumab 300 mg was safe and effective in
reducing CIU/CSU symptoms regardless of background
therapy. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. on

Key words: Omalizumab; Urticaria; Chronic spontaneous;

Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), also known as chronic
spontaneous urticaria (CSU), is defined as wheals or angioedema
that occurs together or separately on an intermittent or constant
basis for at least 6 weeks with no apparent specific trigger.'
Second-generation Hj-antihistamines are an effective first-line
treatment in some patients with CIU/CSU.' An increase in Hyantihistamine dose up to 4-fold is considered second-line therapy.
However, some patients with severe CIU/CSU continue to
experience symptoms despite treatment with increased doses of
H,-antihistamines.”* Third-line treatment options for patients
who do not achieve complete control of their symptoms with
increased dosages of H,-antihistamines have included short-term
corticosteriods, add-on therapy with cyclosporine, a leukotriene
receptor antagonist (LTRA), or omalizumab.'*°

Omalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody to
immunoglobulin E (IgE) that has been licensed for the treatment
of moderate to severe allergic asthma in the United States since

J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT
MONTH 2015

2003 and for severe allergic asthma in Europe since 2005.”°
It was recently approved for the treatment of CIU/CSU in
Europe and the United States.”” Omalizumab was studied in 3
phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical
trials in patients with CIU/CSU. ASTERIA I’ and ASTERIA
II'° evaluated the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous (SC)
omalizumab 75 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg every 4 weeks versus
placebo in patients with CIU/CSU who remained symptomatic
despite treatment with approved dosages of second-generation
H,-antihistamines. GLACIAL'' evaluated the safety and efficacy of omalizumab 300 mg SC every 4 weeks versus placebo in
patients who remained symptomatic despite treatment with up
to 4 times the approved dose of second-generation H,-antihistamines and add-on H>-antagonists and/or LTRAs.

The data from the phase III clinical program represent the
largest database of patients reported to date with refractory CIU/
CSU with nearly 1000 patients included (omalizumab, n = 733;
placebo, n = 242). Guideline recommendations for the use of
omalizumab cite a strong, high level of evidence to support its use
in CIU/CSU." In this past hoc analysis, we compared the efficacy
of omalizumab from the ASTERIA studies, which included only
approved doses of H,-antihistamines as background therapy, with
the efficacy of omalizumab from the GLACIAL study, which
permitted higher doses of antihistamines as well as other types of
background therapy. An evaluation of the pooled safety data and
time to loss of response are also included.

 

 

METHODS
Study design
ASTERIA I and ASTERIA II were multicenter, randomized,

double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of omalizumab 75 mg
(ASTERIA I, n = 77; ASTERIA II, n = 82), 150 mg (ASTERIA I,
n = 80; ASTERIA II, n = 82), or 300 mg (ASTERIA I, n = 81;
ASTERIA II, n = 79) versus placebo (ASTERIA I, n = 80;
ASTERIA II, n = 79) administered SC every 4 weeks in patients
who remained symptomatic despite treatment with approved doses
of H,-antihistamines. These studies were similar in design except for
the duration of treatment, which was 24 weeks and 12 weeks,
respectively (Figure 1). Observational follow-up continued in both
studies for 16 weeks after the last dose of omalizumab. The primary
efficacy endpoint in both studies was change from baseline to week
12 in weekly itch severity score (ISS), a component of the urticaria
activity score over 7 days'~ (UAST7, daily ISS intensity ratings range
from 0 [none] to 3 [intense and/or severe]; range 0-21). Both studies
included the following secondary endpoints evaluated at week 12:
change from baseline in UAS7, change from baseline in weekly

 

number of hives score, time to minimally important difference
(MID) response (>5-point reduction) in weekly ISS, proportion of
patients with UAS7 <6 (well-controlled symptoms), proportion of
patients who were weekly ISS MID responders, change from base
 

line in weekly size of largest hive score, change from baseline in
overall Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), proportion of
angioedema-free days from week 4 to week 12 of therapy, and
proportion of patients with UAS7 = 0 (complete response). The
proportion of patients with complete response was an ad hoc analysis
for ASTERIA II. Time to loss of response (defined as a loss of UAS7
<6) was included as a prespecified exploratory endpoint in both
studies. GLACIAL was a 40-week (24 weeks of treatment and 16
weeks of observational follow-up), multicenter, randomized, double
blind, placebo-controlled study of omalizumab 300 mg (n = 252)

symptomatic despite treatment with up to 4 times the approved
dosage of Hy-antihistamines and either Hb -antihistamines or
LTRAs, or all 3 in combination (Figure 1). The primary objective of
GLACIAL was to evaluate the safety of omalizumab versus placebo;
efficacy was evaluated as a secondary objective. Secondary efficacy
endpoints included the change from baseline in weekly ISS and the
other 9 endpoints listed above from ASTERIA I and II and were
evaluated at week 12. Time to loss of response was a prespecified
exploratory endpoint in GLACIAL. Diphenhydramine 25 mg was
allowed for itch relief in all 3 studies (up to a maximum of 3 doses or
less in 24 hours based on local regulations). All 3 studies were
conducted in accordance with US Food and Drug Administration
regulations, the International Conference on Harmonisation E6
Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and any other applicable
country laws. Institutional review board approval and informed
consent was obtained from all research subjects. These trials are
registered with Clinical 'rials.gov, number NCT01287117
(ASTERIA I), number NCT01292473 (ASTERIA II), and number
NCT01264939 (GLACIAL).

Patients

Patients were eligible for inclusion in these studies if they met the
following criteria: age 12-75 years (18-75 years in Germany; per
German regulatory requirements), diagnosis of CIU/CSU for >6
months, presence of itch and hives for >8 consecutive weeks before
enrollment despite concurrent H,-antihistamine treatment at
approved doses (ASTERIA I and II) or presence of itch and hives for
>6 consecutive weeks before enrollment despite treatment with H,antihistamines at up to 4 times the approved dose plus LTRAs or
H)-antihistamines, or all 3 in combination (GLACIAL; baseline
medication use previously reported’ '), UAS7 >16 (scale 0-42)
and weekly ISS >8 (scale 0-21) for the 7 days before randomization,

in-clinic physician-assessed UAS >4 (scale 0-6) on 1 or more of the
screening visit days, treatment with an approved dose of an H,antihistamine (ASTERIA I and II) or with an H,-antihistamine up
to 4 times the approved dose plus LTRAs or H2-antihistamines, or
all 3 for 3 or more consecutive days immediately before day —14
(GLACIAL), and no missing symptom diary (eDiary) entries in the
7 days before randomization. Exclusion criteria for all 3 studies
included clearly defined inducible trigger for chronic urticaria (eg,
cold, pressure); presence of a disease with symptoms of urticaria or
angioedema; or routine doses (daily or every other day for >5
consecutive days) of systemic steroids, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, or intravenous immunoglobulin within 30 days before day —14, or treatment with
omalizumab in prior year. The individual study publications provide
more detailed discussion of exclusion criteria.”’'!

Assessments

Detailed descriptions of the assessments used in the studies have
been published.”'' Briefly, patients completed a symptom diary
each morning and evening that recorded scores (scale range: 1-3) for
itch severity, the number of hives, and size of largest hive using a
hand-held electronic device. The means of the morning and evening
scores for itch severity and number of hives were summed to derive
the UAS7 (total score range 0-42; higher score reflects greater disease
activity). The weekly ISS is the sum of the daily ISS for 7 days (total
score range 0-21; higher score reflects greater itch severity). Patients
also recorded the presence of angioedema (yes/no) in the electronic
diary. They completed the DLQI at baseline and weeks 4 and 12

(score range 0-30; higher score represents greater impairment).

and omalizumab 150-mg and 300-mg arms of each study were
summarized descriptively. Potential anaphylactic events were identified through an automated search of the AE database using a narrow
search for terms representing core anaphylactic terms and a broad
search that included signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis based on the
Sampson criteria.’ Identified events with a temporal association with
omalizumab administration were sent for external adjudication (see
the Online Repository available at www jaci-inpractice.org for members of the Anaphylaxis Review Committee).

RESULTS
Efficacy

The baseline demographic and disease characteristics for the
ASTERIA I and II pooled populations and the GLACIAL
population were generally similar, except for previous and current therapy for CIU/CSU, which were in accordance with the
eligibility criteria in the studies. The median number of previous
medications for CIU/CSU was higher in patients in GLACIAL
than in the ASTERIA I and II pooled population (Table I). The
mean weekly ISS was significantly reduced from baseline at week
12 in the pooled ASTERIA I and II omalizumab 150- and 300mg treatment arms and in the GLACIAL omalizumab 300-mg
arm (Table II). The magnitude of the reduction in weekly ISS
at week 12 was similar between the omalizumab 300-mg groups
in the ASTERIA I and II pooled and GLACIAL studies

(Table I). The results in the pooled ASTERIA I and II 150-mg
group were consistent with the known dose response of omalizumab (Table II). The proportions of patients with wellcontrolled symptoms (UAS7 <6) and with complete symptom
control (UAS7 = 0) were significantly greater than placebo in
each of the omalizumab groups and were comparable in the 300mg treatment arms of the pooled ASTERIA I and II and
GLACIAL populations (Figure 2). Compared with placebo, the
duration of time to MID response was significantly shorter for
patients in the omalizumab groups and a higher proportion of
patients in the omalizumab groups were weekly ISS MID responders (>5-point reduction) at week 12 in both the pooled
ASTERIA I and II and GLACIAL populations (Table II). Significant treatment differences for omalizumab compared with
placebo were observed across the other efficacy endpoints, and
the magnitude of the differences was comparable in the
ASTERIA I and II pooled and GLACIAL 300-mg treatment
arms (Table II).

In terms of percentage change from baseline at week 12, the
weekly ISS was reduced from baseline by an additional 38%
and 36% over placebo in patients treated with 300-mg omalizumab in the pooled ASTERIA I and II and GLACIAL populations, respectively, and by an additional 25% over placebo in
patients treated with 150-mg omalizumab in ASTERIA I and
II (all P <.0001; Figure 3). Similar results were observed for

 

 

percentage reductions from baseline in UAS7 and weekly number of hives score at week 12 compared with placebo (Figure 3).

At week 12, the mean change in DLQI scores had improved
from baseline by an additional 30% over placebo in the
ASTERIA I and II populations and by an additional 50% in
GLACIAL (both P <.0001; Figure 3). Percentage reductions in
the selected endpoints were similar when ASTERIA I and II were
evaluated separately (see Table E1 in this article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org).

Safety

Omalizumab 150 mg and 300 mg were well tolerated as addon therapy in patients with CIU/CSU who were symptomatic
despite treatment with approved doses of H-antihistamines.
Omalizumab 300 mg was also well tolerated in those who were
taking standard combination therapies for CIU/CSU.

Baseline characteristics for the patient safety population were
similar (see Table E2 in this article’s Online Repository at www.
jaci-inpractice.org). Overall, few patients discontinued treatment
(4.0%) or the study (1.1%) because of an AE. The rates of
treatment and study discontinuation as a result of an AE in the
pooled dataset were 3.4% and 1.7% in the omalizumab 150-mg
group, 3.6% and 1.2% in the 300-mg group, and 5.4% and
1.7% in the placebo group. During the treatment period from
week 1 to week 12, the proportions of patients with >1 AE were

similar in the omalizumab 150-mg and 300-mg groups, but
higher than in the placebo group (Table III). During the 12week treatment period, the rate of serious AEs (SAEs) was low;
the rate of SAEs was higher in the placebo group than in either of
the omalizumab treatment groups (Table Il). SAEs reported in
the placebo group included hemorrhoids, hypersensitivity,
pneumonia, radius fracture, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, cervical dysplasia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease. SAEs were hypertension reported in the omalizumab
150-mg group and melena, retroperitoneal infection, pelvic abscess, angioedema, and tonsillectomy in the omalizumab 300-mg
group.

Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity; 6.2% of patients
in the placebo group, 1.7% of patients in the omalizumab 150mg group, and 5.3% of patients in the omalizumab 300-mg
group experienced a severe AE (Table III). From week 1 to
week 12 of the treatment period, sinusitis (4.9% vs 2.1%), viral
upper respiratory tract infection (0.5% vs 0%), arthralgia (2.9%
vs 0.4%), headache (6.1% vs 2.9%), and cough (2.2% vs 1.2%)
were more common in the omalizumab 300-mg group compared
with the placebo group. Nasopharyngitis (9.1% vs 7.0%), viral
upper respiratory tract infection (2.3% vs 0%), arthralgia (2.9%
vs 0.4%), and headache (12.0% vs 2.9%) were more common in
the omalizumab 150-mg group than in the placebo group. There
was no evidence of dose-related AEs.

The profile of AEs during the longer 24-week treatment
period in ASTERIA I? and GLACIAL"! was similar to that
observed for the pooled data during the 12-week treatment
period, which suggested that there were no observable late-onset
events or any change in the rate of AEs with increased duration
of exposure. The AE profile observed in the pooled phase III
studies was consistent with that known for omalizumab in patients with allergic asthma,'“'® with the exception of AEs specific to the respective indications (eg, urticaria, pruritus). There
were no events of anaphylaxis related to omalizumab reported. In
subanalyses, the AE profile was similar regardless of background
therapy for CIU/CSU.

Time to loss of response

The median time to loss of response in patients who had
achieved a UAS7 <6 (well controlled) at the end of the treatment
period (week 12: ASTERIA I; week 24: ASTERIA I and
GLACIAL) was similar in all 3 studies. Median time to loss of
response for the 150-mg and 300-mg doses of omalizumab was 3
weeks and 5 weeks, respectively, in both ASTERIA I and II. In
GLACIAL, the median time to a loss of response was reported at
7 weeks for omalizumab 300 mg. Placebo patients reported a
median time to loss of response at 7 weeks in ASTERIA I, 6
weeks in ASTERIA II, and 4.5 weeks for placebo-treated patients; this was most likely a reflection of the waxing and waning
of the disease. No rebound effect following omalizumab
discontinuation was noted.

DISCUSSION

Using data from the phase III studies for CIU, we sought to
compare the efficacy, safety, and time to loss of response of
omalizumab in patients with different background therapy.
Despite differences in background therapy between studies,
including triple therapy (Hy-antihistamines, H2-antagonists, and
LTRAs), we observed similar treatment effect sizes across multiple endpoints. This suggests that background therapies in patients with refractory disease do not affect response to
omalizumab (ie, patients with more intense background therapy
respond at the same level as those with less intense background
treatment).
At baseline, mean DLQI scores were higher (ie, worse healthrelated quality of life [HRQoL]) than those observed in patients
with atopic dermatitis, moderate to severe psoriasis, or psoriatic
arthritis, '”?° which indicated considerable impact of CIU/CSU
symptoms on HRQoL. Consistent treatment effects for omalizumab 300 mg versus placebo were observed across multiple

 

efficacy endpoints in patients receiving different background
therapies for CIU/CSU. After 12 weeks of treatment
with omalizumab 300 mg, more than half of patients had

well-controlled symptoms (UAS7 <6) and more than one third
were completely itch- and hive-free (UAS7 = 0).

The European/World Allergy Organization (EAACI/GA*
LEN/EDF/WAO) published guidelines for the management of
CIU/CSU suggest that omalizumab should be used as the third
line of therapy (ie, on top of increased dosage up to 4-fold of
modern second generation antihistamines) in the algorithm of
treatment of urticaria (strong recommendation/high level evidence).' However, the US published guidelines for the management of CIU/CSU suggest that omalizumab should be used
as the fourth step of therapy.”! Yet, there are limited to no robust
clinical data that demonstrate incremental response rates for
therapies other than omalizumab after using step 2 therapies.
Whether or not omalizumab should also be considered as a thirdstep treatment in the United States (after up-dosing of second
generation H,-antihistamines) remains to be determined. A
systematic review of omalizumab in patients with CIU determined that the 300 mg dose has the most compelling data
supporting its use.° The more recently published omalizumab
phase III results, including this pooled analysis, will likely be of
importance to include in such assessments.

There were few serious AEs and the rate of serious AEs was
lower in the omalizumab 300-mg group than in the placebo
group. With the exception of urticaria-specific AEs, the most
common AEs were consistent with those known for omalizumab
in allergic asthma with no instances of anaphylaxis. Most AEs
were mild to moderate in severity. Taken together with the efficacy results, the totality of the data suggests a favorable benefittisk profile for omalizumab in the treatment of CIU.

The loss of response after discontinuation of therapy was similar
despite the length of treatment received by the patient, which
suggested that disease modification does not occur at these treatment durations. Rebound did not occur following omalizumab
discontinuation. The return of symptoms on a consistent basis
highlights the need for more prolonged therapy and a continued
unmet need in this population of patients for disease modification.
Treatment with omalizumab offers a fast onset of relief from
symptoms for many patients with difficult-to-manage symptoms,
yet the nature of the disease requires treatments that can reduce
symptomatology on a chronic basis. Although efficacy over a 6month treatment period has been demonstrated, !' further
studies that evaluate long-term treatment with omalizumab in
CIU/CSU are needed to examine benefits with chronic therapy.

On a practical level, the population of patients in the
GLACIAL study, in which patients were taking multiple
concomitant therapies for CIU/CSU, may be more reflective of
patients with Hj-antihistamine-refractory CIU/CSU encountered
in clinical practice. These patients with refractory symptoms
continued the background therapies once they entered the trial
and demonstrated similar responses to omalizumab as patients
receiving less intense background treatment (ie, approved doses of
H,-antihistamines) indicating that the response to omalizumab is
not appreciably influenced by background therapies.

Because the placebo-controlled period in the ASTERIA II
study was 12 weeks, the current pooled analyses were limited to
evaluating changes up to week 12. However, 2 of the 3 studies,
ASTERIA I? and GLACIAL," also provide safety and efficacy

information for the longer treatment period of 24 weeks.

Additional studies in real-world populations will provide additional information on the efficacy and safety of omalizumab. One
limitation of the UAS7 is that non—urticaria-related itch is
captured and this may result in underestimation of the rate of
complete response (ie, UAS7 = 0) to omalizumab. The analyses
were based on clinical studies with strict eligibility criteria, and,
thus, the results may not be generalizable to all patients
encountered in clinical practice. The indirect comparisons across
different studies and the post hoc nature of the analyses are further
limitations of note.

In summary, the findings from this post hoc analysis indicate that
omalizumab 300 mg had similar efficacy in CIU/CSU patients
regardless of the background therapy for urticaria used in the trials,
and the safety profile in CIU was generally similar to that in allergic
asthma. There was no evidence of dose-related safety issues.
