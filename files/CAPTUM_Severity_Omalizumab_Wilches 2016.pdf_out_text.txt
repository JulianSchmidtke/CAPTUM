Omalizumab for chronic urticaria in Latin
America

Paul Wilches', Paola Wilches!, Juan Carlos Calderon*", Annia Cherrez* and Ivan Cherrez Ojeda**”

 

Abstract

Background: Chronic urticaria (CU) is defined as the spontaneous appearance of wheals, with or without
angioedema, persisting for 26 weeks. Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU) is a type of CU which affects 0.5-1 %

of the global population, but it represents a high burden to patients. In recent years, omalizumab is available as
treatment of disease. Our aim is to extend previous findings, analyzing effects of omalizumab on symptoms in Latin
American patients with CSU.

Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients treated with omalizumab in Cuenca-Ecuador. 150 mg omalizumab was
administered every 4 weeks, and its effects were measured by Urticaria Activity Score (UAS) at baseline and each

significance.

 

Background

Urticaria is a disease characterized by the development of
wheals (hives) and/or angioedema. Chronic urticaria (CU)
is defined as the spontaneous appearance of wheals, with or
without angioedema, persisting for >6 weeks. CU has been
categorized into two main types: chronic spontaneous
urticaria (CSU) owing to known or unknown causes and
inducible urticaria (CIndU) [1]. CSU has been reported to
affect 0.5-1 % of the global population at any given time
and to account for approximately two-thirds of all cases of

month in follow up. Complete response was defined as a UAS of 0 or 1, and partial response was classified as a
UAS of 2 or more. Also, demographic and clinical variables were collected. Descriptive analyses were employed.
Response rates were summarized as counts and percentages after 3 and 5 months. Related Samples Wilcoxon

signed rank tests were used to compare UAS at baseline and after 3 months. P values <0.05 indicated statistical

Results: 26 subjects were enrolled, almost half were female individuals (57.7 %), with mean age 47.8 years (range,
18-81 years). Mean duration of CU after diagnosis was 23.3 months (range, 2-180 months). Mean UAS at baseline
was 5.7 points (range, 4-6 points). Nine patients (34.6 %) completed 3 months of treatment (33 % reported a
complete response), with a mean difference in UAS of 3.33 (p = 0.01). Four patients completed 5 months of
treatment (75.0 % showed a complete response). All patients previously treated with first-generation antihistamines
plus corticosteroids showed no responses at neither 3 nor 5 months of treatment.

Conclusion: Omalizumab is an effective treatment for patients with CU. It is necessary to conduct some future
investigations where we can establish if 150 mg could be an option in developing countries.

CU. CSU can have a considerable burden on patients,
healthcare systems, and society [2].

Studies evaluating the economic impact of CSU have
estimated that the total annual cost per patient in the
US is $2047, with indirect costs accounting for 15.7 %
($322) [3]. This disease has been associated with many
daily activities and can affect quality of life, for example,
by contributing to absence from work or impairing work
performance [3, 4].

Although antihistamines are the mainstay of treatment
for CSU, some patients are non-responsive to higher
doses of Hj-antihistamines. Treatment guidelines for
these patients recommend the addition of omalizumab,
cyclosporine, or montelukast [1].

Omalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antiimmunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody, at a dose of 150 and/or
300 mg every 4 weeks for 3 or 6 month showed a significant improvement of itching score and UAS 7, with a
sustained control of CSU symptoms in clinical trials [5-7].
This agent also showed good efficacy in real-life studies, in
that approximately 82 % of patients had a complete or
significant response to 150 or 300 mg omalizumab every
4 weeks, and 60 % stopped taking concomitant medications; moreover, omalizumab is well tolerated and has a
good safety profile [8, 9]. Furthermore, excellent rates of response using adjusted [10, 11], as well as fixed omalizumab
doses were observed in CSU patients [12].

To extend previous findings, this retrospective study
analyzed the effects of omalizumab on symptoms in
Latin American patients with CSU.

Methods

This retrospective analysis involved 26 patients who
presented with anti-histamine refractory CSU from January
2012 to April 2015 and were treated with omalizumab in
Cuenca-Ecuador. Anti-histamine-refractory CSU was defined as having uncontrolled symptoms (defined as persisting of pruritus and urticaria) for at least 6 weeks, despite an
up to 4-fold increase in the dose of non-sedating H,-antihistamine and/or the addition of other therapeutic agents,
such as H,or sedating antihistamine, for 4 weeks [1].
Patients were subcutaneously administered 150 mg omalizumab every 4 weeks, with the dose being independent of
patient body weight and serum IgE level.

The effects of omalizumab were analyzed by measuring
the Urticaria Activity Score (UAS), a validated measure
assessing disease activity in patients with CIU/CSU, before
and after treatment by the patient and with supervising of
the same physician or assistant physician in each visit [13].
The UAS evaluates itch severity and number of hives
daily, with 0-3 points for each and total scores of 0-6
[13]. Complete response was defined as the disappearance
of hives and pruritus, with a UAS of 0 or 1, and partial
response was classified as a UAS of 2. Patients were
classified as non responders when neither remission nor
any improvement in symptoms was experienced during
the treatment period or the UAS was >2 after3 and
5 months of treatment. Reduction of concomitant medication after three and five omalizumab doses was assessed
as secondary outcome during follow-up. The study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital Monte
Sinaf in Cuenca, Ecuador.

Demographic and clinical variables were also collected,
including age, sex, and previous medications. Medications
were subclassified as first and second generations of antihistamines and corticosteroids, alone or in combination.
Other variables evaluated included duration of CSU and
IgE levels.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive analyses (frequency and percentage, standard
deviation and range) were employed for demographical
and clinical variables at baseline and follow-up. Response
rates were summarized as counts and percentages after 3
and 5 months. Normal distribution of data was assessed
by the Lilliefors corrected Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
Related Samples Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to
compare UAS at baseline and after 3 months and
5 months. Post hoc backward regression analyses were
performed in order to identify responders to low dose/
short period of treatment with omalizumab. All statistical
analyses were performed using SPSS software version 19.0
(SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), with P values <0.05 indicating statistical significance.

Results

The 26 subjects enrolled in this study included 15 female
individuals (57.7 %) and 11 male individuals (42.3 %), of
mean age 47.8 years (range, 18-81 years). Mean duration
of CU after diagnosis was 23.3 months (range, 2-180
months) and the mean IgE level was 570.6 kU/L (range,
55-2500 kU/L). Six patients (23.1 %) had comorbidities,
and thyroid disease was included in the differential
diagnosis of ten (38.5 %) patients (Table 1).

At initiation of omalizumab treatment, the mean UAS in
the 26 patients was 5.7 points (range, 4—6 points) (Table 2).
All 26 patients had been treated previously: 11 (42.3 %)
administered second-generation antihistamines plus corticosteroids and six (23.1 %) administered second-generation
antihistamines alone (Table 1). Among patients receiving
corticosteroids plus antihistamines, in average it was
administered corticosteroids among 3-4 months, and even
one of them was using intramuscular corticosteroids once a
month by 6 months plus hydroxyzine by 2 years. Patients
who had been receiving second generation antihistamines,

they were receiving a two-fold an even four-fold increased
doses in an average of 3 months. Among five patients
taking first generation antihistamines, all of them were
administered with hydroxyzine (25-50 mg) in an average of
2 months.

Of the 26 patients, nine (34.6 %) completed 3 months
of omalizumab treatment, whereas 17 (65.4 %) didn’t.

Over time, UAS decreased from a mean 5.7 points to a
mean 2.0 points (Table 2). Of the nine patients who completed 3 months of omalizumab treatment, three (33 %)
showed a complete response (UAS of 0-1 point) and four
(44.4 %) showed a partial response (UAS of 2 points)
(Fig. 1). These nine patients had a mean UAS at 3 months
of 2.3 (SD 1.7) points (Table 2). Compared with the mean
UAS at baseline of 5.7 (SD 0.7) points in the 26 patients,
the mean difference between baseline and 3-month UAS
(n =9) was 3.3 points (95 % confidence interval, 2.0—4.7
points, p=0.01). Of the four patients who completed
5 months of treatment, three (75.0 %) showed a complete
response (Table 3), with a mean difference between
baseline and 5-month UAS of 4.0 (95 % CI 0.8-7.2). No
serious adverse events were reported.

Patients who received or not the three doses were
similar in response at the beginning of treatment. Nine
patients who received third doses began with a UAS of
5.7 (SD 0.7). After, they continued with a UAS of 3.1
(SD 1.4) at first month, and UAS of 2.6 (SD 1.6) at
second month of treatment. Meanwhile, patients who
didn’t receive the third doses began with a similar UAS
(5.6, SD 0.5), and after one (3.5, SD 1.3) and second
month of treatment (3.0, SD 1.4) remained similar.

Of the 17 patients (65.4 % of all patients) who didn’t
receive a third doses: 23.5 % (four patients) received two
doses and 76.5 % (13 patients) only received one dose.
Among patients who received two doses, half reported
UAS of two (partial response), one reported a UAS of 3
and another reported a UAS of five (non responders).
Patients with partial response didn’t comeback, and they
reported relieving of symptoms when were contacted by
phone. In non responders, one patient complained about
high cost of treatment and the other was a lost of
follow-up.

Between patients who only received first doses (13
subjects), two (15.4 %) reported complete response (one
patient complained about high cost of treatment). In the
11 remaining patients, mean UAS was 3.8 (SD, 0.6). In
this group of patients, complaints about high cost of
treatment was 63.6 %, and remaining patients were lost
of follow up.

Of three patients who achieved a complete response at
fifth month of treatment, three of them reported
complete and only one reported partial response at third
month. But, all of them reported complete response at
fourth month.

Although UAS at 3 and 5 months did not correlate significantly with previous medications (p > 0.05), all patients
previously treated with first-generation antihistamines
plus corticosteroids showed no responses at three (mean
UAS 3.5, range 2-6) and five (mean UAS 3, range 1-5)
months.

Finally, all patients were discontinued of administering
corticoids during all follow up. After first administration,
65.4 % (1 = 17) patients were administering levocetirizine
5 mg, 11.1 % (m=3) were taking levocetirizine 10 mg,
and 11.1 % were taking hydroxyzine 10 mg. Also, 3.7 %
(n=1) were taking hydroxyzine 25 mg, 3.7 % were

taking levocetirizine 5 mg plus hydroxyzine 10 mg, and
3.7 % loratadine 10 mg plus hydroxyzine 50 mg.

After third administration, one of the patient (50.0 %)
taking levocetirizine 10 mg, diminished the dose to 5 mg
of levocetirizine. Otherwise, one of the patient (20.0 %)
taking levocetirizine 5 mg discontinued this medication
after receive 5 months of omalizumab.

The patient under loratadine 10 mg plus hydroxyzine
50 mg at the beginning of this study, he diminished dose
of hydroxyzine to 25 mg but continued taking loratadine
10 mg after fifth administration of omalizumab (Aditional file 1: Database file).

Discussion

Large multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled phase III trials have shown that omalizumab, at
doses of 150 and 300 mg every 4 weeks for 3 months, significantly improved urticaria outcomes compared with placebo in patients with CSU [5-7]. Moreover, broader studies
in actual clinical practice have provided strong evidence for
the efficacy of omalizumab, showing a complete or significant response in approximately 82 % of patients, with 60 %
of patients stopping concomitant medications [8].

One of the limitations of retrospective studies is their use
of subjective methods of evaluation to show categorical
responses to omalizumab [8, 14, 15]. A study from Spain,
in which the UAS was used to assess disease activity, found
a significant reduction in the mean UAS in a subgroup of
38 patients, from 5.34 + 0.88 before treatment to 0.66 + 1.3
after 3 months (p< 0.005) [8]. Similarly, using UAS, we
found that 77 % of our patients had a complete or partial
response after treatment with omalizumab for 3 months,
and a recent study reported that 60 % of patients responded
when started on the same doses [14]. The use of concomitant medication significantly decreased, because 60 % of
patients were able to withdraw all medications using omalizumab [8]. In our patient after 3 doses we reduce concomitant medication in one patient (11.1 %), and withdraw all
medications in another one patient (11.1 %). After five
doses, the reduction of concomitant medication was
reported by one patient (25 %) and withdraw in another
patient (25 %).

However, 65.4 % of patients didn’t complete 3 months of
treatment, most of them (47.1 %) because the cost of omalizumab and it not being reimbursed by health insurance
programs. Kaplan et al. [16] established that they are not
aware of any formal definition of response to treatment in
patients with CIndU/CSU. Uysal P et al. [17] found that
55.5 % of patients reached a UAS <2 after two or three
doses of 150 mg of omalizumab, and no definition of
response to treatment was stablished. Recently, Palacios T
et al. [18] found that basophil CD203c-upregulating activity
could predict lower clinical response, but further studies
are needed to confirm this association. In our study, we

used post-hoc backward logistic regression analyses in
order to identify responders to low dose/short period of
treatment with omalizumab. It was included sex, age, time
with disease, previous medication, and UAS at first month
and third month. Any factor was identified as marker of
response to treatment after third or fifth doses of omalizumab. It could be explained because small sample size and
lack of power. It is likely that patients who did not response
to monthly dose of 150 mg, they would had responded to
doses of omalizumab of 300 mg.

In countries where economic issues make access to treatment difficult, a monthly dose of 150 mg should be a good
option to control CU. In our not responder patients, one
options could be increase dose to 300 mg. Further research
about timing of response, length of treatment, delay in
response and identifying specific phenotypes in response to
omalizumab would be essential to physicians who have
patients requiring omalizumab for management of CSU.
Also, it is necessary to conduct some future investigations
where we can establish if 150 mg could be an option in
developing countries. No adverse effects were reported in
any patient during treatment, confirming the long-term
safety profile of omalizumab.

Conclusions

CU can have a negative impact on the physical, emotional
and social lives of patients. Omalizumab represents a new
and effective treatment for patients with CU. Treatment
of patients with low incomes should be individualized
because the high cost of this agent prevents patients from
completing at least 3 months of treatment. It is necessary
to conduct some future investigations where we can
establish if a lower dose of omalizumab (150 mg) could be
an option in low/middle income countries.
