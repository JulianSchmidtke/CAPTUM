The Essential Role of Anti-Thyroid Antibodies
in Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria

Background. An autoimmune etiology has been suggested in up to one-third-of cases of chronic
idiopathic urticaria (CIU), in which it has been proposed that a subset of cases are associated with
thyroid autoimmunity. The objective of our present study was to verify the prevalence of thyroid
antibodies in the patients with CIU. Methods. Sixty patients aged'12-51 years, who met criteria for
CIU, and 40 aged-matched healthy controls (18 males and 22 females) were participated in this
study. Serum anti-thyroid antibodies (ATAs), thyroid hormones, total.immunoglobulin E (IgE), and
food allergen-specific IgE antibodies were measured. The CIU group was treated with anti-H1 and
anti-H2 histamines for 3 weeks. Results. The total ATA positive rate was 27.3% (33% males and 25%
females) in the CIU group. The prevalence of anti-thyroglobulin. antibodies, anti-TSH-receptor
antibodies, and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies were 16.6%, 83.3%, and 8.3%, respectively. The
thyroid hormones, T3, and T4, and the TSH were within the normal limits. The radioallergosorbent
test was negative for food allergens, and only 18% of the patients had a total IgE concentration
>200 IU/mL. Conclusion. ATAs were found in 27% of the patients with CIU, but these antibodies did
not dysregulate thyroid hormone secretion nor did they mediate any clinical manifestations.

INTRODUCTION

There is growing evidence showing that the prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity in
patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is higher than in the general population, but the resultof this finding is controversial (1,2). The development of antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies, anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TG) antibodies,
and anti-TSH antibodies is a main feature of autoimmune thyroid disease (3). The
prevalence of anti-thyroid antibodies (ATAs) has been estimated to be 12-29% in CIU
patients (4,5). In addition, the presence of anti-FcepsilonRI and anti-immunoglobulin
E (anti-IgE) autoantibodies in a subset of patients with chronic urticaria suggests that
they play a pathogenetic role (6); however, there are no data to suggest that any of the
ATAs are pathogenic with regard to CIU. Rather, they are believed to be associated
with autoimmune phenomena (7). Therefore, it is important to evaluate the relationship between thyroid auto-immunity and thyroid function in CIU. Understanding this
relationship is potentially useful in evaluating the treatment benefits of either thyroid
hormones or anti-thyroid drugs in resistant cases of CIU.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In a prospective case-control study, we evaluated ATAs (anti-TG, anti-TSH, and antiTPO) and TSH, T3, and T4 in 60 patients presenting with CIU and in an age-matched
control group of 40 healthy subjects. We also assessed serum total IgE levels and
reactions to common food allergens including egg white, milk, wheat, peanuts, peas,
crab, shrimp, shell-fish, tuna, cod, mango, and kiwi fruit by a radioallergosorbent test
in our study-group participants. The study group was treated with anti-H1 and anti-H2
histamines for 3 weeks.

The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 1.2 for Windows, SPSS,
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) computer software was used for all statistical analyses. A
p-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

RESULTS

The frequency of thyroid autoantibodies was significantly higher in patients with CIU
than in healthy controls (27.3% vs. 0%; p < 0.05). The prevalence of the different ATAs
are listed in Table 1. For anti-TG, anti-TSH, and anti-TPO antibodies, the prevalence
was 16.6%, 83.3%, and 8.3%, respectively (Table 1). Participants in the study group and
in the control group had thyroid hormone concentrations within the normal limits.
Radioallergosorbent test was negative for antibodies to food allergens in the study
group, and the serum total IgE concentration was lower than 200 IU/mL in more than
80% of the study participants. After 3 weeks of the treatment with combined anti-H1
and anti-H2 antihistamines, about 80% of the patients had relief from skin eruptions.

DISCUSSION

Chronic urticaria is defined as the presence of hives for at least 6 weeks with the
assumption that the condition occurs daily or almost daily (8). About 80-90% of
patients with chronic urticaria have no identifiable external causes for their condition,
which is therefore designated CIU. Up to 30-50% of idiopathic cases may be autoimmune (9). The autoimmune subgroup is associated with anti-FcepsilonRI (35-40%)
and anti-IgE autoantibodies (5-10%). These autoantibodies have been shown to
activate blood basophils and cutaneous mast cells in vitro with augmentation of
basophil activation by complement and release of C5a (8).

CIU is well known to be associated with ATA and autoimmune thyroiditis (10,11).
A highly statistically significant association has been found between chronic urticaria
and hypothyroidism, specifically with regard to anti-TG and anti-microsomal

Anti-Thyroid Antibodies in Chronic Urticaria 87

autoantibodies (12). Although autoimmune phenomena have been regularly associated with chronic urticaria in adults, data in children are sparse. In a pediatric study,
Levy suggested that children with chronic urticaria should be screened periodically for
thyroxine, TSH, and ATA, because thyroid autoimmunity and hypothyroidism may
appear several years after the onset of the urticaria (13). Therefore, there is growing
evidence suggesting that patients with CIU and thyroid autoimmunity benefit from
treatment with levothyroxine sodium or anti-thyroid drugs; however, although treatment with thyroxine has brought about clinical remission of chronic urticaria, no
change has been demonstrated in thyroid antibody levels (14). ATA and positive
autologous serum skin tests in these patients could be the markers of autoimmune
disease for several target organs (15); however, there are no compelling arguments to
decide whether thyroid autoimmunity plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of
chronic urticaria (1,2,16). In fact, while some markers of autoimmunity may be
increased in urticaria patients, broad nonspecific autoimmunity has not been found.

Other conditions with which autoimmune thyroid diseases are associated include
pernicious anemia, connective tissue disorders, diabetes, celiac disease, mood disorders such as depression, and fertility-related problems. Often, there is no demonstrable cause-and-effect relationship, and it is debatable in some cases whether it is
worthwhile monitoring patients with autoimmune thyroid disease for other conditions or vice versa (17).

In the present study, the overall ATA positivity was 27.3% (anti-TG, 16.6%; antiTSH, 83.3%; and anti-TPO, 8.3%) in the patients with CIU, but was not found in any of
the control group of volunteers; however, the appearance of ATA did not affect thyroid
hormone secretion (T3, T4, and TSH) nor did ATA induce any clinical features of
autoimmune thyroiditis. In addition, patients with CIU remained euthyroid. Common
food allergens did not seem to be a risk factor for CIU, and the test results were
negative in all the patients. Ultimately, treatment with combined anti-H1 and anti-H2
histamines for 3 weeks resulted in a total remission of the skin eruptions in 80% of the
CIU patients (18).

In conclusion, ATAs were found in 27% of the patients with CIU, but these antibodies did not dysregulate thyroid hormone secretion nor did they appear to mediate
any clinical manifestations.
