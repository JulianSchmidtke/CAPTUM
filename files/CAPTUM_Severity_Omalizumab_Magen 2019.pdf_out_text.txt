ABSTRACT

Background: Omalizumab resistance (OmR) in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) remains poorly understood.

Objective: To identify clinical and laboratory attributes of patients that may be predictive of OmR in CSU.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study by using an electronic patient record data base of patients with
severe CSU refractory to a fourfold H,-antihistamine dose, treated with omalizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks for at least 24 weeks.
Complete response (CR) was defined as the reduction of baseline urticaria activity score by = 90%, partial response (PR) by =
30% to <90%, and OmR by <30% at 24 weeks. The patient characteristics of the CR, PR, and OmR groups were compared.

Results: Sixty-three patients (58.9%) had a complete remission at 24 weeks of omalizumab therapy, and 16 patients (14.9%)
had OmR. The patients who were OmR were characterized by a higher rate of arterial hypertension 7 (43.8%), higher mean +
standard deviation (SD) high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) level (10.3 + 8.2 mg/L), mean + SD white blood cell
(WBC) count (9.1 + 2.8 x 10° cells/mL), and higher mean + SD C3 level (164.3 + 45.4 mg/dL) at baseline than the patients
with CR (arterial hypertension, 9 [13.1%], p = 0.009; mean + SD hs-CRP, 3.4 + 10.1, p = 0.014; mean + SD WBC count,
6.5 + 3.8 X 10° cells/mL, p = 0.012; and mean + SD C3 level, 121.8 + 42.1 m/dL, p < 0.001). In multivariable analysis
adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index, OmR was associated with an hs-CRP level of >3.0 mg/L (odds ratio 1.94 [95%
confidence interval, 1.28-3.15], p = 0.009) and with C3 > 160 mg/dL (odds ratio 1.54 [95% confidence interval, 1.05-2.36],
p = .017).

Conclusion: Obesity, arterial hypertension, high plasma C3 level, and high-CRP level were associated with OmR in severe CSU.

Nowetns H,-antihistamines are the first-line
treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria
(CSU), and up to a fourfold dose increase is recommended if there is no improvement.' In 2014, omalizumab was approved both in the United States and the
European Union for use in patients with CSU that was
refractory to high-dose H,-antihistamines,” and, since
then, it has become the preferred method of treatment
for CSU in patients unresponsive to Hy-antihistamines.’ However, omalizumab resistance (OmR) in
CSU remains undefined.

Health Care Services (LHS), a health maintenance organization that covers ~730,000 residents of Israel nationwide. The study protocol was approved by the
institutional review board of LHS. Patients with CSU
with severe refractory to a fourfold H1-antihistamines
dose, treated with omalizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks
for at least 24 weeks without concomitant montelukast,
systemic steroids, or cyclosporine at community allergology centers of LHS from December 2014 to May
2018 were included. The exclusion criteria were as
follows: a diagnosis of any active infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases; malignancy; and pregnancy.

The patients were followed up by board-certified
allergists, who routinely evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of omalizumab by using the urticaria activity
score at each visit.* Complete response (CR) was defined as the reduction of the baseline urticaria activity
score by = 90%, the partial response (PR) by =30% to
<90%, and OmR by < 30% at 24 weeks. Overweight
and obesity were defined by a body mass index
(BMI) = 25 kg/ m? and BMI = 30 kg/ m’, respectively.

Statistical Analysis

Variables were tested for normality by using the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Statistical significance for
continuous variables was calculated by using analysis

273
of variance, and, for categorical variables, by using the
x’ test. We dichotomized concentrations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) into =3.0 and >3.0
mg/L, the white blood cell (WBC) count into =11.0
and >11.0 x 10° cells/mL, serum C3 into =160.0 and
>160.0 mg/dL, BMI into =27.0 and >27.0 kg/m’, and
the independent association between disease status
(CR, PR, OmR) was assessed by using a multivariable
linear regression model with adjustment for age and
sex. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Data
were analyzed by using SPSS Software version 18
(SPSS Inc., IBM-SPSS, Chicago, IL).

RESULTS

Patient characteristics are listed in Table 1. Sixtythree patients (58.9%) had a CR at 24 weeks of omalizumab therapy, and 16 (14.9%) were OmR. Patients
with OmR were more likely to be obese (p = 0.02)
compared with patients with CR. The clinical indicator
of excess adiposity, BMI, was also significantly higher
in the OmR group (mean + standard deviation [SD]
29.4 + 2.3 kg/m’) than in the CR group (mean + SD
27.2 + 2.5kg/m?; p = 0.002) and the PR group (mean +
SD 27.5 + 3.1 kg/m’; p = 0.039). The patients with
OmR were characterized by the higher mean + SD
hs-CRP level (10.3 + 8.2 mg/dL), mean + SD C3 level
(164.3 + 45.4 mg/dL), and mean + SD white blood cell
(WBC) count (9.1 + 2.8 x 10° cells/mL) at baseline
than the patients with CR (mean + SD hs-CRP level,
3.4 + 10.1 mg/L, p = 0.014; mean + SD C3 level,
121.8 + 42.1 mg/dL, p = 0.001; and mean + SD WBC
count, 6.5 + 3.8 cells/mm®, p = 0.012) (Table 1). The PR
group was distinguished from the OmR group by the
higher mean + SD total immunoglobulin E (IgE)
(159 + 72 IU/mL; p = 0.046) and lower mean + SD C3
level (164.3 + 45.4 mg/dL, p = 0.003) (Table 1).

The results of multivariable analysis of the clinical
and laboratory factors associated with OmR after adjustment for age and sex only are shown in Table 2.
When adjusting for age, sex, and BMI, the associations
with OmR remained positive for hs-CRP value (odds
ratio 1.94 [95% confidence interval, 1.28-3.15]; p =
0.009) and for the C3 level (odds ratio 1.54 [95% confidence interval, 1.05-2.36]; p = 0.017) (Table 3).

DISCUSSION

The fact that ~15% of the patients with CSU were
OmR indicated the involvement of mechanisms
and/or pathways in CSU other than the IgE cascade.>
Possible effects of serum total IgE, thyroid autoantibodies, eosinophil counts, rheumatologic markers, Creactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation
rate on clinical response to omalizumab in CSU were
evaluated previously in small retrospective studies.°”
Omalizumab had robust efficacy in the patients with

274

antihistamine refractory CSU regardless of their autoimmune status, age, sex, IgE level, or dosing schedule.”

Previously, Kessel et al.8 showed a significant link
between increased total IgE levels and disease severity
in CSU. Furthermore, free-IgE reduction and downregulation of the high-affinity IgE receptor was shown
to be correlated with CSU clinical improvement with
omalizumab therapy.’ Nevertheless, previous studies
that explored the clinical and laboratory predictors of
response to omalizumab reported a worse response to
omalizumab in patients with CSU with lower baseline
serum Igk.'0" Earlier, Altrichter et al.!? found that
patients with antithyroid autoantibodies responded
better to omalizumab. However, our study was unable
to fully reproduce those findings, may be due to the
small number of patients in the OmR group. Nevertheless, we observed higher levels of total IgE in patients
with CSU with partial resistance to omalizumab than
in patients with OmR. Although not addressed by
publications yet, we know that some patients who
were resistant were responding to a dosage of >300 mg
(e.g., 450 mg or 600 mg) or of 300 mg given every 2-3
weeks. Thus, our small study may have underestimated those for whom IgE had a pathogenic role.

In our study, obesity was a condition that was associated with the reduced effectiveness of omalizumab in
CSU. In a recent large epidemiologic study, we found
CSU to be positively associated with metabolic syndrome and obesity.’ The relationship between obesity
and arterial hypertension is obvious, but the relationship among obesity, arterial hypertension, and CSU
has not yet been fully investigated.’ The connection
among CSU, obesity, and OmkR is especially interesting
and may suggest a pathophysiologic contribution of
factors, e.g., adipokine-induced inflammation. Patients
with obesity and metabolic syndrome have elevated
levels of proinflammatory cytokines and CRP.'° We
postulated that the action of adipokines may be targeted directly to human mast cells, and their activation
may aggravate the clinical severity of CSU."®

We observed the laboratory results of low-grade inflammation in OmR CSU that was supported by the
higher levels of hs-CRP and C3, and the WBC count in
the OmR group. Because all these biomarkers are
acute-phase reactants produced under the influence of
interleukin (IL) 1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) a, and
IL-6, it was likely that the increased levels of hs-CRP
and C3, and of the WBC count were hallmarks of the
immune activation in the patients with OmR.'” Increased levels of circulating TNF-a, IL-1B, IL-12p70,
and IL-6 were observed in most patients with CSU,
together with an enhancement of IL-2 secretion after
T-cell stimulation.'® Moreover, elevated hs-CRP levels
were found to be common in patients with CSU, and
high hs-CRP levels may predict poor responses to antihistamines.'” Elevated plasma C3 levels in CSU were

also observed in earlier studies.”° In addition, C3 levels
were found to be significantly higher in patients with
CSU with metabolic syndrome and were positively
correlated with a CSU severity score.?!

In our study, the C3 level was similarly higher in
patients with CSU and with BMI > 27 kg/ m2, and was
directly correlated with the higher CSU severity score.
The observed higher C3 levels in patients with OmR
could reflect an ongoing low-grade inflammation in
this population. Both C3 and CRP are synthesized
mainly in the liver in response to cytokines, e.g., IL-1B,
IL-6, and TNF-a, which are increased in subjects with
active CSU.” Analysis of the accumulated data has
shown that, in some patients with CSU, complement
components are involved in degranulation of mast
cells and basophils.*°7# Local complement deposition
of complement can be found in approximately onethird of CSU urticarial lesions.2*”° In CSU, pathogenic
IgG cross-links the IgE receptor directly to cause histamine release, and this process is augmented by C5a.2”
Because the study was a retrospective and descriptive
in nature, we had no data on complement consumption and release of anaphylatoxins, nor an explanation
whether the complement played any role in OmR.
Previously, research groups found that hypertension is
independently associated with the severity and duration of CSU.75?? A positive association of OmR and
arterial hypertension in our patients may be partially
explained by higher rates of obesity and higher BMI in
the OmR group. The link between OmR and hypertension may also be related to low-grade inflammation.2%3!

The observed higher WBC counts in the patients
with OmR might be another interesting finding. Because a diagnosis of CSU is mainly clinical, we do not
usually perform skin biopsies. Therefore, we could not
judge on role of the WBC count in the histopathology
of OmR CSU. Winkelman and Reizner™ first described
neutrophilic chronic urticaria as a separate entity. Since
then, several research groups have described a percentage of patients with CSU and with a neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate predominance, which ranges
from 15.8 to 48.8%.°° According to some investigators,
neutrophil-predominant CSU has been considered to
be a variant of CSU related to H, treatment resistance,** but the influence of neutrophil predominance
on OmkR is still unidentified. Other investigators proposed that the presence of neutrophils in CSU biopsy
specimens is a common finding and does not seem to
have an influence on CSU clinical severity or on prognosis.** Therefore, today, there is not enough scientific
evidence to support neutrophilic chronic urticaria as a
separate entity, and most researchers postulate that the
presence of neutrophils is just associated with the inflammatory process.

We understand that this study had several limitations due to the retrospective design implemented. To
further validate our findings and to better characterize
clinical and pathophysiologic features of subjects with
CSU and OmR, prospective studies are needed. Second, the laboratory tests (WBC, hs-CRP, C3) were not
measured before and after omalizumab treatment to
define any changes in these parameters. Third, active
forms of C3, such as C3a and C3b, were not assessed to
identify how C3 functioned, and, consequently, correlation studies of C3a and C3b with OmR were not
conducted.

Conclusion

Additional research is required to further explore the
role of low-grade inflammation to OmR to provide
possible biomarkers for future personalized therapeutic approaches in CSU.
