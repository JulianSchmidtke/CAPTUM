Abstract:

Background: Omalizumab has been shown to be effective in treating chronic spontaneous urticaria
(CSU). The reduction of FceRI receptor density on the surface of basophils and mast cells is thought
to play a major role in its effectiveness. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled trial to investigate the mode of action of omalizumab in patients with antihistamine
resistant CSU.

Methods: Thirty patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 300 mg omalizumab or
placebo. Four monthly applications of omalizumab/placebo were followed up with a visit 2 months

after the last injection. The primary endpoint was the FceRI receptor density change on basophils.

Results: Omalizumab led to a significant reduction of FceRI receptor density on

basophils as soon as 1 week after the first injection: baseline omalizumab vs. placebo group, 80.31 +
47.18x10? vs. 78.29 + 45.09x10? receptors/basophil + SD; 1 week, 72.89 + 47.79x10? vs. 27.83 +
20.87x103, p=0.001. This effect continued during the treatment phase and persisted for 2 months
after the last injection: 93.81 + 56.50x10? vs. 21.09 + 15.23x10?, p=0.002. Values for basophil
“releasability” and the basophil activation test (CU-BAT) of patient serum using donor basophils
were unchanged despite treatment: CU-BAT, CD63 10.75% (7.35) in the placebo group vs. 8.35%

(15.20) in the omalizumab group, p=0.778.

Conclusion: We demonstrated a rapid reduction of FceRI receptor density on basophils following
treatment with omalizumab. Because CU-BAT using well-characterized, omalizumab-naive donor
basophils did not change during the treatment phase, autoreactive serum factors seem to remain
unaltered. This points towards a cellular effect of omalizumab on basophils. To predict the

omalizumab response time and to monitor disease, FceRI density and CU-BAT might be promising

cellular-based assays.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common disease with a point prevalence of 1% of the
general population [1]. Patients manifest with hives on most days for a period of at least 6 weeks.
The disease is often accompanied by angioedema and tends to be cyclical in nature, with
spontaneous disappearances and frequent relapses [2]. In most cases, no underlying disease or

allergy can be found [3].

CSU treatment relies mainly on second-generation antihistamines and is purely symptomatic. While
some patients respond to standard-dose second-generation antihistamines, in others off-label (for
CSU) treatments with high-dose H1-antihistamines, leukotriene receptor blocking agents,

cyclosporine A, or systemic corticosteroids are needed [4, 5].

Based on several randomized controlled trials [6 — 8], the monoclonal anti-lgE antibody omalizumab
was recently licensed for the treatment of antihistamine-resistant CSU [9]. The mechanism of action
of omalizumab in CSU is still not fully understood. Omalizumab binds selectively to free IgE in
plasma, inhibits its binding to FceRI receptors on the surface of mast cells and basophils, and reduces
the number of FceRI receptors on basophils in atopic patients [10, 11] and those with CSU [12, 13]. A
significant reduction of FceRI receptor density on the surface of circulating basophils has been found
as early as 1 week after the administration of omalizumab [14]. In contrast, a decrease in FceRI
receptor density on mast cells may occur later [11]. The role of basophils in CSU is still debated [15],
but basophils may be an accessible and relevant model to analyze the effect of omalizumab on FceRI

expression and on the level of basophil activation.

About half of CSU patients have autoantibodies against FceRI, few against IgE [16, 17]. Other
autoimmune markers such as IgE and IgG antibodies against thyroid peroxidase are frequently found
[18]. Sera of CSU patients can activate the resting basophils of normal donors to release histamine
and upregulate the activation markers CD63 and CD203c [19, 20]. The basophil activation test with
donor basophils (CU-BAT) involves measuring CD63 upregulation as an activation marker and is
already established as a specific, sensitive, and safe in vitro assay to detect functional autoantibodies
[19 — 22]. In addition, the FceRI receptor density itself might be another important parameter for the
quantification of mast cell and basophil “releasability” and therefore a good in vitro surrogate

marker for their reactivity.

To gain insight into the pathophysiology of some forms of CSU and the mode of action of
omalizumab, we evaluated the effect of omalizumab treatment in patients with CSU by investigating
three parameters: FceRI receptor density on the surface of basophils, determined by flow cytometry;
the functional consequences of a change in FceRI receptor density, evaluated via the crosslinking of
FceRI / IgE receptor complexes induced by autoantibodies (basophil releasibility); and whether
typical CSU serum factors responsible for basophil degranulation were altered during treatment.
Based on the findings of Gericke et al. [23], a post hoc analysis was performed to identify differences

between early and slow responses to omalizumab.

Methods

Study design

In a monocentric, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial we investigated the mechanism
of action of omalizumab in antihistamine-resistant CSU over a period of 7 months, between
September 2012 and April 2014. Thirty patients diagnosed with CSU were recruited and randomly
assigned to two groups in a 2:1 ratio to receive either omalizumab (n=20) or placebo (n=10).
Omalizumab (Xolair®) was administered in four monthly treatments at a fixed subcutaneous dose of
300 mg as currently licensed [6, 24]. Before the first administration, disease activity was assessed
and documented over a 4-week period with the urticaria activity score (UAS), followed by the 16week treatment period with 4 injections of omalizumab/placebo. Two months after the last

injection, a final study visit to follow up treatment efficacy and study outcomes took place.

The study was approved by the local ethics committee and by Swissmedic, the Swiss agency for
therapeutic products. The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH)/WHO Good Clinical Practice, and all national,

state, and local laws.

This investigator-initiated study was funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland). Their
representatives were not involved in the design of the study or any data collection, analysis, or

interpretation.

Study population

Patients between the ages of 18 and 70 with CSU were included in the study if they met the
following criteria: symptoms for at least 6 weeks, with hives present at least twice weekly, and
symptoms refractory to standard doses of H1-antihistamines at the time of randomization. Patients
signed informed consent forms documenting their understanding of the study procedures and the
investigational nature of the study. Exclusion criteria were purely inducible urticaria, clearly defined
allergic urticaria, treatment with omalizumab during the last year, known hypersensitivity to
omalizumab or any of its components, history of cancer in the previous 5 years, parasitic infections,
documented active tuberculosis or ongoing recent (in the preceding 4 weeks) antituberculous
therapy, documented prior treatment with systemic immunosuppressive agents (short-term
prednisolone for CSU exacerbations was allowed), current pregnancy or nursing, known intolerance
to any protocol intervention, and lack of accountability. Any contraception had to be performed by a

safe, reliable, and accepted method such as oral or implanted contraceptives or tubal ligation.

Patients were allowed to take their usual medications (H1-antihistamines up to a fourfold single

dose, H2-antihistamines, montelukast, short-term prednisolone for CSU exacerbations) for the

treatment of CSU, but systemic immunosuppressive agents other than prednisolone were not

permitted, as they might influence basophil assays.

Basophil assays

Two assays evaluated basophil phenotype and function, while another measured the presence of

serum factors inducing donor basophil degranulation/activation.

a)

b)

c)

The FceRI density on basophils was measured at randomization and on the day of the first
treatment, and thereafter at 1 week, 1 and 3 months, and 2 months after stopping
treatment. The FceRI receptor density was assessed by QIFIKIT (Dako-Cytomation, Glostrup,
Denmark) according to the instructions of the manufacturer [25]. For each quantification,
500-1000 basophils were acquired using CCR3 basophil-specific staining. FceRI receptor
density was defined according to the standard curve using beads with ascending predefined
receptor densities.

Basophil releasability was measured with and without IL-3 coincubation at three timepoints
(baseline, 1 week, and 3 months after the first injection) by assessing the activation marker
CD63 [26] after stimulation with anti-lgE (not omalizumab, Beckman Coulter, Krefeld
Deutschland) at the concentrations of 1000, 100, 10 and 1ng/ml. Cells were stained with
monoclonal anti-CD63-FITC antibodies (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) and fluorescence
was measured by FACSCanto® (Becton Dickinson AG, Allschwil, Switzerland)

The CU-BAT involved incubating the serum of study participants on well-characterized
basophils from 10 donors both at baseline and at the last injection to detect the presence of
activating serum factors. CD63 served as an activation marker, with expression data
presented as the percentage of activated basophils and the stimulation index (SI), expressed
as the percentage of activated basophils after stimulation with patient serum divided by the
percentage of activated basophils without stimulation (negative control) [22]. The donors
were previously screened for reactivity to negative and positive controls as well as for
basophil activation with different IL-3 concentrations. All serum samples were immediately

stored at -20°C in aliquots to avoid repetitive freeze-thaw cycles.

Patient assessments

All participants were required to document their symptoms once daily for 1 month using the

urticaria activity score [27]. Medications taken were documented on their study questionnaires.

Study endpoints
The primary endpoint of the study was the FceRI receptor density change on basophils during the

first 12 weeks of treatment with omalizumab and 2 months after treatment.

Secondary endpoints included comparison of basophil releasibility with and without IL-3 incubation
at three timepoints (baseline, 1 week, and 3 months); comparison of CU-BAT at baseline and 3
months; and change in the weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7) at baseline, 3 months and 5
months. We evaluated the proportion of patients with a UAS7 of <6, a UAS7 of 0, and an itch

severity score (ISS) of 0.

We summarized the proportion of patients who used H1- and H2-antihistamines, montelukast and
prednisolone, and coded adverse events using the medical dictionary for regulatory activities

(MeDRA) and their corresponding preferred terms and assigned body systems.

Post hoc analysis

Recently, Gericke et al. observed that the presence of autoreactive serum components predicted the
response time to omalizumab treatment [23]. We therefore performed a post hoc analysis to
identify differences in FceRl-receptor density, autoreactive serum components (measured by CUBAT), and total IgE in omalizumab partial/non-responders, early responders, and slow responders.
Based on a previous report [23] we divided all study patients into 4 groups: placebo; partial/nonresponder, defined as a UAS7 >6 at 3 months or a reduction of UAS7 to <6 or less at 3 months
compared to baseline; early responder, defined as a treatment response within 8 days, with the first
day of response determined as the first day of UAS7 <6; and slow responder, defined as a treatment
response after 8 days but UAS7 <6 at 3 months. For each of these groups, we compared FceRI
receptor density, CU-BAT results, and total IgE at baseline, and calculated whether there was a

difference in FceRI density and CU-BAT between baseline and 3 months.

Sample size determination

A biological effect for the primary outcome was determined to be a difference of FceRI receptor
density of 45,000 per basophil, assuming a standard deviation of 40,000 Fc-IgE per basophil. A power
of 80%, a two-sided p-value of 0.05, and 2:1 randomization resulted in an overall sample size of 30

patients, with 20 in the active group and 10 in the placebo group.

Analysis of primary, secondary, and other efficacy endpoints

The primary endpoint, FceRI receptor density, was analyzed using generalized estimation equations
(GEE) with a negative binomial distribution family, log link, and robust standard errors due to strong
skewness and heteroscedasticity when using mixed effects linear models. Treatment group and
baseline receptor density were included as fixed effects. The mean of the two pretreatment visits
was taken as the baseline receptor density. We report the ratio between treatments, with a ratio <1
indicating a reduction in receptor density. We used the same methods to analyze FceRI receptor

density at each follow-up time.

Analysis of the primary endpoint followed the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. Missing primary
endpoint values were imputed by multiple imputation techniques using sequential chained
equations based on baseline characteristics. Altogether, 12 of 150 (8.0%) FceRI receptor

measurements were missing, the majority at the last visit.

As a sensitivity analysis, we also performed the main analyses on the per-protocol population.

Twenty-four patients who completed all treatments according to the protocol were included.

Secondary endpoints are summarized using descriptive statistics. Odds ratios (OR) for the UAS7 and

ISS were calculated using penalized logistic regression by Firth’s method [28].

Analysis was performed using Stata 13.1 and 14 [29]. For all analyses we report estimates and 95%
confidence intervals (Cl) when relevant. Descriptive statistics report mean and standard deviation
(SD) for continuous and normally distributed data or median and interquartile range (IQR) for non
normally distributed or highly skewed data. Count and percentages are reported for binary data.

Results

Study Patients

A total of 77 patients were screened, 41 of whom were excluded, 32 for good disease control with
antihistamines, 4 for use of immunosuppressive drugs, 4 for spontaneous remission, and 1 for use of
omalizumab in the last 12 months. Six patients declined to participate. Two patients in the placebo
group withdrew consent as a consequence of disease progression, and two in the omalizumab group

were lost to follow-up.

Most baseline characteristics (age, weight, BMI) did not differ between the placebo and omalizumab
groups (Table 1). The proportion of women was 80% in the placebo group and only 40% in the
omalizumab group, but probably because of the small sample size. The UAS7 at baseline was 18.5
(11.3, 23.5) in the placebo group and 11.0 (2.5, 21.5) among omalizumab patients, while the ISS at
baseline was the same in the two groups. Angioedema occurred in 53% of patients (70% in the
placebo group, 45% in the omalizumab group). Disease duration was 27.0 (19.8, 64.8) months in the
placebo group and 19.5 (12.0 33.8) in the omalizumab group.

There were eight partial/non-responders, seven early responders, and two slow responders in the
omalizumab group; three patients who dropped out could not be classified. There were no partial

responders.

FceRI receptor density

At baseline, no significant differences in FceRI receptor density were found between the two groups
(Figure 2, Table 6). Compared to placebo, 300 mg of omalizumab led to a rapid and significant
reduction of FceRI receptor density as soon as 1 week after the first injection (72.89 + 47.79x10? vs.
27.83 + 20.87x10? receptors/basophil, respectively, p=0.001). Again compared to placebo, the
receptor density in the omalizumab group remained low throughout the treatment period (values at
3 months: 95.88 + 54.17x10? vs. 17.47 + 21.41x10%, respectively, p=<0.001), and was still low at 2
months after the last injection (93.81 + 56.50x10? vs. 21.09 + 15.23x103, respectively, p=0.002).

Basophil releasability

Regarding basophil releasability, expressed as Log10 of the anti-IgE (not omalizumab) concentration
resulting in half-maximal activation of basophils (LC50), no significant difference of the LC50 value
could be found between the two groups at the start of treatment (with or wthout IL-3). Treatment
did not result in a consistent change of releasibility (Table 2a). Interestingly, the basophil

releasability measured with IL-3 coincubation decreased in the omalizumab group during the study

(higher values indicate lower basophil releasability). However, due to the small sample size,

statistical significance cannot be shown.

Effect of omalizumab on serum factors

Patient serum was incubated twice with third-party donor basophils (at baseline and at 3 months).
Compared to placebo, the percentage of activated donor basophils was slightly higher in the
omalizumab group at baseline: the CD63 positivity was 12.05% (10.80) vs. 18.35% (17.77),
respectively, p=0.244; the SI values were similar, 4.20 (5.50) vs. 5.00 (7.20), respectively, p=0.535.
There was no significant difference in either parameter between the placebo and omalizumab
groups, both at baseline and the last injection: CD63 positivity, 10.75% (7.35) vs. 8.35% (15.20),
respectively, p=0.778; SI, 3.20 (2.45) vs. 2.75 (3.50), respectively, p=0.847. Treatment did not

significantly affect the activity of these serum factors (Table 2b).

CSU activity
The UAS7 was summed for a week before each study visit, and the proportions of patients with mild
(UAS7 of <6) or no symptoms (UAS7=0) were evaluated. The proportion of patients with no itching

(ISS=0) in the week before the corresponding visit was also assessed (Table 3).

We observed no significant differences at baseline in UAS7<6 (OR 1.47; 0.26, 8.43) or ISS=0 (1.21;
0.15, 9.92) between the placebo and omalizumab groups. We observed a significant difference in the
proportion of patients with mild symptoms (UAS7 <=6) at the time of the last injection (7.80; 1.28,
47.53); it was increased in the omalizumab group (76%) but remained unchanged in the placebo
group (25%). The proportion of patients with ISS=0 showed no significant difference between the
two groups; the odds of having a score of 0 were higher in the omalizumab group, though the
difference was not statistically significant (both 15.21; 0.76, 305.06). Two months after the last
injection, the proportion of patients with UAS7<6 and ISS=0 showed no significant difference

between the placebo and omalizumab groups.

Post hoc analysis

In a post hoc analysis we classified all study patients into 4 groups: placebo, partial/non-responder,
early responder, and slow responder (Table 4). At baseline, FceR! density was equal among the
placebo, slow responder, and early responder groups, but lower in the partial/non-responder group

(p=0.094). Compared to placebo, there was a reduction of the FceRI density on basophils in all three

treatment groups, although the partial/non-responder group demonstrated the least reduction: 45.3x10? (-74.9; 0.3) receptors per basophil in the partial/non-responder group, -99.7x10? (-138.9; 60.5) in the slow responder group, and -91.7x103 (-154.3; -63.7) in the early responder group). As a
sign of autoreactive serum components at baseline, CU-BAT results in the omalizumab group were
highest in the partial/non-responder group (CD63 positivity 26.3% (8.7; 44.6)) and lowest in the early
responder group (CD63 positivity 17.1% (4.5; 24.8)), though these differences were not statistically
significant. There was a slight but nonsignificant reduction of the CU-BAT in all three treatment
groups. Two patients in the partial/non-responder group had an increase of CU-BAT under
omalizumab treatment. The total IgE values at baseline were lowest in the partial/non-responder

group.

Discussion

We found that treatment with omalizumab resulted in a rapid and significant reduction of FceRI
density on basophils, which is consistent with previous studies [10, 11, 14] and confirms the results
of Deza et al. [12] and Metz et al. [13]. This reduction was observed as soon as 1 week after the
initiation of treatment and remained reduced for at least 2 months after the last omalizumab
application (last study visit), although CSU often flares up by this later timepoint. The reduction of
FceRI density is thought to be one of the central mechanisms of omalizumab’s action in CSU [30]. In
accordance with recent findings [12], FceRI density at baseline was reduced in patients who did not
respond to this therapy. The partial/non-responder group demonstrated the least reduction of the
FceRI density under omalizumab treatment. Correspondingly, post hoc analysis showed that total IgE

values before treatment were lowest in partial/non-responders.

We expected a reduction of basophil releasability, applying titrated concentrations of degranulating
anti-IlgE (not omalizumab) to patient basophils. However, this was not the case. Investigation of
basophil releasability using a high-affinity degranulating anti-IgE antibody, even in titrated form,
might produce a signal too intense to show subtle differences in basophil releasability. Basophil
stimulation with an allergen (in sensitized individuals) might have led to different results.
Unfortunately, the study included only nine pollen-sensitized patients, which was too few to confirm
this hypothesis. Interestingly, treatment with omalizumab has been shown to lead to increased
sensitivity of basophils using IgE-mediated stimuli [31], a phenomenon that is not fully understood.
In addition, no alteration of mast cell or basophil histamine release was observed when cells were
coincubated with omalizumab in vitro [32], but this might not reflect the in vivo activity of

omalizumab.

We investigated changes of autoreactive serum factors, which may occur in CSU patients, during
omalizumab treatment. By coincubating well-characterized donor basophils with the serum of CSU
patients (CU-BAT), the omalizumab-treated basophils of the patient are replaced by treatment-naive
donor basophils, which allows a focus on transferable serum factors alone. Again, no difference was
found between the two study groups either at baseline or over time. This suggests that omalizumab
does not interact with or alter autoreactive or other urticaria-promoting serum factors. However,
CU-BAT results were very heterogeneous and the sample size was small, which hampered the
statistical analysis. Interestingly, higher CU-BAT results at baseline were associated with slow or
partial/non-response to omalizumab, with partial/non-responders having the highest values,
findings that are consistent with those of Gericke et al. [23]. Two partial/non-responders even

demonstrated an increase in CU-BAT under omalizumab treatment.

While CSU is a mast cell-driven disease, our experimental approach relied on basophils due to their
better accessibility and the assumptions that a) basophils play a relevant role in the pathogenesis of
CSU [13, 20], and b) analysis of basophil activity is a relevant model for changes of omalizumabinduced mast cell activity. While omalizumab does not lead to a significant reduction of autoreactive
serum components, its effect might rely on cellular changes. It is well known that circulating
basophils are recruited into skin lesions in CSU [33 - 35]. It is possible that omalizumab decreases the
ability of basophils to migrate into the skin, for example by altering their chemokine receptor
repertoire. Consistent with this hypothesis, Metz et al. showed a decrease in the number of FceRI+

skin cells under omalizumab treatment [13]

Our study population was heterogeneous: 6 of our 30 patients had a changing disease course with
only mild symptoms at baseline compared to the time of study inclusion. This reflects the natural
course of CSU, which is characterized by intermittent remissions, and might explain the
nonsignificant differences in various endpoints. Furthermore, as we intended to study patients with
severe forms of CSU, there were eight partial/non-responders. This probably influenced the study
outcomes, but gave us the opportunity to identify differences between slow, early, and partial/non
responders.

CSU tends to remit spontaneously, and thus far no sustained disease-modifying effect of
omalizumab has been documented after the medication is discontinued. Furthermore, the response
time after initiating omalizumab treatment varies greatly. FceRI density on basophils, CU-BAT, and

total IgE might be appropriate parameters to predict response time and disease course under

omalizumab. Assessing these factors before initiating treatment with omalizumab could help
differentiate between early, slow, and partial/non-responders. In particular, low FceRI density
and/or high CU-BAT at baseline might predict whether a patient will be a partial/non-responder.
Practically speaking, it would be even easier to determine the total IgE value at baseline, as it
corresponds to FceRI density, meaning that a low total IgE predicts a low FceRI density.

In patients who respond to omalizumab, treatment discontinuation is necessary to reveal the
underlying disease status. As omalizumab did not lead to a reduction of CU-BAT, a disappearance of
autoreactive serum components under omalizumab treatment might indicate remission of CSU.
However, this assumption would only be valid in CU-BAT-positive CSU patients (approximately 3040% of all CSU patients).

Conclusion

This study contributes to understanding CSU pathogenesis and the mode of action of omalizumab. It
substantiates the previous observation that the reduction of FceRI density is rapid and sustained.
The clinical efficacy of omalizumab did not correlate with serum changes (CU-BAT results remained
stable throughout the study period). This points towards a primarily cellular effect of omalizumab on
basophils. To predict the response time of omalizumab and for disease monitoring, FceRI density and

CU-BAT are promising cellular-based tests if used before treatment initiation.

Values are calculated as LC50 (Log10 of anti-IgE concentration in ng/ml resulting in half-maximal activation of basophils). Higher values indicate lower basophil releasability. Median and
interquartile range (IQR) are each measured with two methods. P (unadj.) from Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test for baseline values. Ratios and p for ratios calculated from linear regression models
on log-transformed data for specific times, or from a mixed-effects model including patient ID as a random effect for a repeated measures analysis (*).

CD63 served as an activation marker and is expressed as the percentage of activated basophils. The stimulation index is expressed as the percentage of activated basophils after stimulation
with patient serum divided by the percentage of activated basophils without stimulation (negative control). Median and interquartile range (IQR) are each measured with two methods. P

(unadj.) from Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test for baseline values. Ratios and p for ratios calculated from linear regression models on log-transformed data for specific times, or from a mixed-effects

model including patient ID as a random effect for a repeated measures analysis (*).

Urticaria activity score (UAS7) was summed for a week before the above times and evaluated for the proportions of patients with mild (UAS7<6) or no symptoms (UAS7=0). ISS was evaluated
for the proportion of patients with no itching (ISS=0) in the week before the corresponding visit. Odds ratios (OR) for the UAS7 and ISS were calculated.

* At time of study inclusion, all patients had UAS7>6.

We compared different biological effects among the patients classified into 4 groups (placebo, partial/non-responder, slow responder, and early responder) using the chisquared test and the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis rank test as appropriate. We compared the FceRI receptor density, CU-BAT results (i.e., CD63 change), and total IgE

values at baseline, and calculated whether there was a difference of FceRI receptor density and CU-BAT between baseline and 3 months.
