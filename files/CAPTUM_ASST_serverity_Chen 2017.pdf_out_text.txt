Abstract

Background: Clinical features and basophil activation levels correlate with serum

autoreactivity and allergen sensitivity in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU).

Objectives: To explore the relationship of the expression patterns of plasma T-helper cell
(Th) 1, Th2, Th17, and Th22-related cytokines with the serum autoreactivity and the allergen

sensitivity in CSU.

Method: Twenty related cytokines were measured and analysed in 60 CSU patients, 15
acute urticaria patients, 10 patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), and 15 healthy persons,
respectively. Autologous serum skin testing (ASST) and skin prick testing (SPT) were
performed to detect autoreactivity and allergy sensitivity, respectively. The protein-protein
interaction of cytokines and the molecular pathways were analysed by Search Tool for the
Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) and KyotoEncyclopedia of Genes and

Genomes (KEGG database), respectively.

Results: Th1/Th2 and Th17 related cytokines were significantly elevated and correlated with
disease activity in CSU than in healthy controls. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and IL-13 were
significantly higher in acute urticaria than in CSU patients. Granulocyte/macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-10 and IL-17 were significantly higher in ASST + than

in ASST- CSU patients. IFN- y , IL-2, IL-12p70, and IL-21 were significantly higher in SPT +

than in SPT- CSU patients. The plasma levels of interferon- y , IL-2, and IL-21 varied among
ASST+/SPT+, ASST+/SPT-, ASST-/SPT+, and ASST-/SPT- CSU subgroups, which appeared to
involve the positive regulation of the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of

transcription (Jak-STAT) signaling pathway.

Conclusion: This study indicates acute urticaria elicits a more prominent Th2 immune
response than CSU. There was association between different expression patterns of plasma
Th1-, Th2-, Th17-, and Th22-related cytokines and serum autoreactivity or allergen
sensitivity in CSU. Further studies on the JAK-STAT pathway in the pathogenesis of CSU is

warranted.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is one of the most common subtype of chronic
urticaria.’ The long-lasting course and distressing symptoms have a grave impact on life
quality. The exact etiopathogenesis of CSU remains poorly understood. Increasing evidence
indicated that inflammation and unbalanced immunity play critical roles in the generation
and promotion of the recurrent symptoms.”° Inflammatory cells and the cytokines released
in the peripheral circulatory micro-environment are proposed to determine the immune

response in CSU.?°

The activity of T cells is largely dependent on the differentiation of TO cells into subtypes of
CD4+ T helper (Th) cells, such as Th1, Th2, Th17, and Th22 cells, which can be further

grouped based on distinct cytokine profiles.*° A complex network of cytokines released by

the Th cells is involved in various autoimmune and allergic responses.” Interleukin (IL)-1se
of a complex network of cytokintumour necrosis factor (TNF)-( are typically Th1 cytokines
involved in cell-mediated pro-inflammatory responses, while Th2- cytokines, such as IL-2,
IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-13, can inhibit Th1 cytokine production, augment humoral
responses, and mediate allergic diseases.’” The imbalance between Th1 and Th2 has long
been considered as a possible mechanism in urticaria.’* “* Th17 cells, which produce IL-17,
IL-17F, IL-21, transforming growth factor (TGF)-B and IL-23, are thought to contribute to
autoimmune and allergic diseases.’° IL-22 is synthesized and released by Th22, and both

IL-22 and Th22 have been confirmed to play important roles in atopic diseases.’°

Autologous serum skin test (ASST) is a simple and effective procedure to test serum
autoreactivity in CSU patients. Skin prick test (SPT) can provide useful evidence of allergen
sensitivity. About 30-62% of CSU patients were found to have autoreactivity as indicated by
ASST,*’-"9 and 25-58% with allergen sensitivity as demonstrated by SPT.”° Our previous
studies revealed that CSU patients with distinct responses to ASST and SPT displayed
different disease activity, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and response to
antihistamines, 7* while the CD63 expression in basophils was found to be highest in ASST+

SPT+ CSU patients.”

The current study was aimed to analyze the association of distinct responses to ASST and/or
SPT in CSU patients with different immune status and cytokine profile. We used a protein
array to determine the plasma concentrations of 20 respective cytokines related to Th1,

Th2, Th17, and Th22, in patients with CSU, as compared to acute urticaria, atopic dermatitis

and healthy controls. The protein-protein interactions between differently expressed

cytokines and the corresponding pathways were further mapped and analyzed.

Materials and Methods

Subjects

This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Southwest Hospital, Third Military
Medical University, Chongqing, China. Patients and controls were fully informed with given
consent prior to enrollment. At the start of the study, the detailed medical history of
subjects and controls was assessed with systemic examinations to exclude any potential
autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. Diagnosis of CSU or acute urticaria was based on the
new EAACI/GA2LEN/WAO/EDF guidelines.’ Patients with diagnosis of acute urticaria were
followed for 6 weeks and those with total natural course exceeding 6 weeks were ruled out.
All patients diagnosed with CSU underwent ASST and SPT in our clinics. Patients with
urticaria factitia or urticarial vasculitis were excluded, and those with any clinical evidence
or history of autoimmune or inflammatory diseases were ruled out following an appropriate
investigation. Patients taking H1 antihistamines seven days before enrollment and those
who had received corticosteroids or immunosuppressants in the six weeks prior to
enrolment were also excluded. The urticaria activity score for 7 days (UAS7) at the time of
patient recruitment and UAS at the time of blood drawing was recorded for each CSU
patient according to the guideline.’ The disease activity were graded as follows: 0-14
(mild),15-29 (moderate) and 30-42 (severe) based on the UAS7 score. Controls were age

and sex-matched healthy subjects without any history of urticaria and being negative for
both SPT and ASST. Patients with clear and definite diagnosis of atopic dermatitis (AD)
following the AD criteria of Hanifin and Rajka ~°, but without any other inflammatory
diseases were enrolled in one group. For cytokine study, 5 mL of morning venous blood
from each patient and control was collected in a collection tube with
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Samples were centrifuged at 400g for 15 min to separate

the plasma, and stored at -80°C.

Autologous serum skin testing (ASST) and skin prick testing (SPT)

ASST and SPT was performed in CSU patients as previously described.”” ” The allergens of
SPT included the house dust mites Dermatophagoides farinae and Dermatophagoides
pteronyssinus, cockroach allergen, mugwort pollen, humulus pollen, fish (catfish), shrimp,
crab, egg, cow milk and peanut. Allergic sensitization was indicated when a patient showed

eps 22
one or more positive result to allergens tested above.

Plasma cytokine analysis

Twenty respective cytokines of Th1 (IL-1, IFNy, granulocyte/macrophage
colony-stimulating factor — GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-12p70, IL-28A, TNFa, TNF-B), Th2 ( IL-4, IL-5,
IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, macrophage inflammatory protein-3a), Th17 (IL-17, IL-17F, IL-21, TGF-B,

IL-23), and Th22 (IL-22) were measured in stored plasma using a commercially available

multiplexed sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based quantitative array
(RayBiotech, Inc., Norcross, GA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Data
extraction was performed using the GAL file specific for this array, along with microarray
analysis software (GenePix, ScanArray Express, ArrayVision, MicroVigene, etc.). The
concentration of cytokines in the samples was determined by comparing the signals from

unknown samples to the standard curve.

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and molecular pathways analysis

To analyse PPIs of the cytokines significantly elevated, we used the STRING (Search Tool for
the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) database (http://string-db.org/), which includes
known and predicted protein interactions.~* To identify the pathways in which these
proteins may be involved, we used the KEGG (KyotoEncyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)
database (http://www.kegg.jp/), a collection of manually drawn pathway maps representing

. . . 25
molecular interactions and reactions between networks.

Statistical analysis

Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests were used to verify the distribution of cytokine
concentrations and assess the normal distribution of their means, respectively. Continuous
variables with normal distributions were expressed by the mean + standard deviation.

Those with non-normal distributions were described by medians and interquartile ranges.

Student’s t-test or the Mann-Whitney U-test was performed to analyse differences in
cytokine concentration between any two groups. One-way analysis of variance or the
Kruskal Wallis test was used to compare differences between more than two groups.
Statistical significance was set by two-sided p values of less than 0.05 for all tests. Data
analysis was performed with SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and Graph-Pad

Prism version 5 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).

Results

A total of 60 patients with CSU, including 15 ASST+/ SPT+, 15 ASST+/ SPT-, 15 ASST-/ SPT+,
and 15 ASST-/ SPT-, were recruited. The UAS7 at the time of patient recruitment and UAS at
the time of blood drawing did not show significant differences among the subgroups. The
number of patients with different disease activity as follows: mild (n=16), moderate (n=29),
severe (n=15). The control groups included 15 patients with acute urticaria, 10 with atopic
dermatitis as atopic control (AC), and 15 healthy controls (HC). Their demographic and

clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1.

Cytokine expression pattern in CSU and acute urticaria

The plasma concentrations of 11 cytokines were higher in the CSU than in the healthy
control group, including IFN-y (p = 0.004), IL-2 (p = 0.001), IL-5 (p = 0.018), IL-6 (p = 0.004),

IL-12p70 (p = 0.027), IL-13 (p = 0.008), IL-21 (p = 0.012), IL-23 (p = 0.038), TGF-B1 (p = 0.006),

TNF-a (p = 0.004), and TNF-B (p = 0.045). 8 cytokines, including IFN-y, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-21,
IL-23, TNF-a and TNF-B, were correalted with the disease severity of CSU (Fig. 1.). In
patients with acute urticaria, only 6 cytokines were expressed at significantly higher levels
than in healthy controls: IL-4 (p = 0.021), IL-6 (p = 0.00009), IL-10 (p = 0.0086), IL-12p70 (p =
0.045), IL-13 (p = 0.00039), IL-17 (p = 0.0049) (Supplementary Table 1). Representative
images of cytokine arrays captured by the laser scanner are shown in Fig. 2. Among the 20
cytokines measured, significant differences for IL-6 (p = 0.012), IL-10 (p = 0.00039), and IL-13
(p = 0.022) were found between CSU and acute urticaria, with values being generally higher

in acute urticaria (Fig. 3).

Differences in cytokine expression profiles in CSU patients between ASST+

and ASST-, or SPT+, SPT- CSU and atopic control

Thirty CSU patients were ASST+, and the other 30 were ASST-. The plasma level of 12
cytokines, including IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17, IL-21, IL-22, IL-23, TGF-B1, TNF-a,
and TNF-f, was significantly higher in ASST+ CSU patients than in healthy controls. In ASSTCSU patients, only 5 cytokines were more significantly expressed, including IL-2, IL-6, IL-13,
TGF-B1, and TNF-a (Supplementary Table 2). Three cytokines, GM-CSF (p = 0.0011), IL-10 (p
= 0.026), and IL-17 (p = 0.004), displayed significantly different expression patterns between
ASST+ and ASST- CSU patients (Fig. 4). Of the 60 CSU patients, 30 were SPT+ and 30 were
SPT-. Compared to healthy controls, 13 cytokines were significantly more abundant in the

plasma of SPT+ CSU patients: IFN-m, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-21, IL-22, IL-23,

TGF-B1, TNF-a, and TNF-B. In SPT- CSU patients, only four cytokines, IL-2, IL-6, IL-21, and
TNF-a, exhibited greater abundance. The expression of four cytokines was significantly
higher in the SPT+ than in the SPT- CSU patients: IFN-y (p = 0.0035), IL-2 (p = 0.04), IL-12p70

(p = 0.0070), and IL-21 (p = 0.00026) (Fig.5).

Higher levels of IFN-y, IL-2, and IL-21 is related to allergen sensitization and

serum autoreactivity in CSU

The IFN-y and IL-2 plasma levels did not change between ASST+/SPT+, ASST+/SPT-, and
ASST-/SPT+ subgroups. IFN-y was significantly lower in ASST-/SPT- than in ASST+/SPT+ (p =
0.0070), or than in ASST-/SPT+ (p = 0.0025) subgroups, whereas IL-2 was significantly higher
in ASST+/SPT+, ASST+/SPT-, and ASST-/SPT+ than in ASST- SPT- patients (p = 0.0079, 0.0251,
and 0.0055, respectively). The IL-21 plasma concentrations in ASST+/SPT+ (p = 0.0003) and
ASST-/SPT+ (p = 0.0025) were significantly higher than in ASST-/SPT-. IL-21 was significantly

higher in the ASST+/SPT+ than in the ASST+/SPT- subgroup (p = 0.0251) (Fig. 6).

Potential pathogenic role of IFN- y , IL-2, and IL-21 in CSU

The analysis of STRING database showed significantly more interactions between the
corresponding networks of IFN-y, IL-2, and IL-21 (p = 0.00457), which are all involved in
positive regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation on the signal transducer and activator of

transcription (STAT) protein (p = 7.04*10°). KEGG pathway analysis showed that these three

cytokines are involved in the Jak-STAT signaling pathway (p = 6.0*10°). Analysis of the
actions of these cytokines and the top 10 confidence proteins showed that the action
network causes upregulation of STAT1 and SHC adaptor protein 1 (SHC1) (Fig. 7). The
interactions of IFN-y, IL-2, and IL-21 with the top 10 confidence cytokines are shown in

Supplementary Table 4.

Discussion

Our observations of mixed Th1/Th2 and Th17 responses in CSU patients with increased
circulating levels of Th1, Th2 and Th17 related cytokines, and concentrations of most of
these cytokines were correlated with the severity of the disease, which support the
existence of an autoimmune basis and pro-inflammatory process in CSU. An increase of
mainly Th2 related cytokines in our patients with acute urticaria, as compared to healthy
controls or CSU subjects, indicated that acute urticaria is associated with a more prominent

Th2 immune response than CSU."” 7°

The finding of a high IL-10 level in acute urticaria with
marginal reduction after 2 weeks was also reflected in our result that IL-10 was only
elevated in acute urticaria but not in CSU as compared to healthy controls, presumably due
to its consumption during the long lasting course of CSU. The different cytokines profiles
between acute urticaria and CSU shown in our study suggest that patients with a generally

activated Th1/Th2 and Th17 cytokines instead of a dominant Th2 cytokine pattern will

transform into chronic urticaria. A time-course study of the cytokine changes in CSU

patients will help to identify which group of patients will develop chronic urticaria from the

beginning.

Previous studies showed that the levels of IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, IL-23 and TNF-a were higher in
ASST + than in ASST- CSU patients.””? In the current study, serum levels of IL-10 and IL-17
were elevated, with no difference in IL-13, IL-23 and TNF-a. The reasons for this discrepancy
are unclear. We found for the first time an increased level of GM-CSF in ASST+ CSU patients.
As GM-CSF can amplify IL-3-induced differentiation of basophils from bone marrow cells *°,
and basophil is an important effector cell of urticaria, with much higher CD63 expression in
basophils of CSU patients than in normal subjects, a higher GM-CSF level may play a role in

the pathogenesis of CSU.

Our current study revealed significantly higher levels of Th1, Th2, Th17 and Th22 related
cytokines in SPT+ CSU, indicating a mixed cytokine pattern of inflammation in a subgroup of
CSU patients with allergen sensitivity. Higher plasma concentrations of Th1 and Th17 related
cytokines in SPT+ than in SPT- CSU patients indicated a possible association between
allergen sensitivity and a predominant Th1-Th17 immune activation. It remains to be
determined whether this subgroup of patients will differ in urticarial activity, course and

prognosis.

Overexpression of IFN-y indicates overactive Th1 response, which can lead to
autoimmunity.” IL-2, another Th1 related cytokine, can enhance basophil histamine
release.*? IL-21 from the interleukin-2 family, in synergy with IL15 and IL18, can stimulate

IFN-y production in T-cells.** Synergistic effects of IFN-y, IL-2, and IL-21 display positive

lymphocyte-mediated immunity.*> >”

In the current study, positive ASST and/or positive SPT
CSU have higher levels of IFN-y, IL-2, and IL-21, which can activate the basophils leading to a

high CD63 expression. This may be one of the reasons to explain why CSU patients with both

allergen sensitization and serum autoreactivity had the highest level of CD63 expression.”

STRING database is a comprehensive and well-established tool used to analyze and predict
the protein-protein interaction. KEGG PATHWAY is a collection of manually drawn pathway
maps representing current knowledge on the molecular interaction networks. Using the
STRING database and KEGG pathway, we found that IFN- y , IL-2, and IL-21 are all
significantly involved in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway through upregulation of STAT1 and
SHC1. Inflammatory disorders commonly associated with JAK-STAT pathway include
systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn’s disease,

ulcerative colitis, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.*®?

Our results suggest JAK-STAT pathway
may play a role in the pathogenesis of CSU, especially in patients with allergen sensitization

and serum autoreactivity.

There are three major limitations in the current study. The cross-sectional time-point blood
sampling cannot reflect the time-course change of CSU. It is unclear if the demonstrated
cytokine profiles are specific to CSU or not, due to the lack of an autoimmune disease
control. Future studies should recruit larger sample sizes, especially in the subgroups of

patients.

This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
In conclusion, our study indicated that CSU patients may contain heterogenous subgroups
regarding autoreactivity or allergen sensitivity based on the results of ASST and SPT,
respectively. The association of IFN- y , IL-2, and IL-21 with both autoreactivity and allergen
sensitivity suggests JAK-STAT pathway may involve in the pathogenesis of CSU. Further
studies are required to understand the correlation between the cytokine changes and the

subtypes, activity, course, and prognosis of CSU.
