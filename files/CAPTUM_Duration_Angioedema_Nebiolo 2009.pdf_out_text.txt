Background: Reliable clinical or laboratory markers of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) duration are not available.
Angioedema, autologous serum skin test (ASST) results, and antithyroid antibodies have been inconsistently associated with
longer urticaria duration.

Objective: To investigate the association of clinical and laboratory parameters with CIU duration, including systemic
hypertension, because activation of the coagulation cascade pathway may contribute to the pathogenesis of CIU.

Methods: We performed a prospective study of a cohort of 228 consecutive adult patients with CIU of moderate to severe
intensity referred to 2 outpatient allergy clinics and followed up for a 3- to 5-year period. The association of clinical and
laboratory parameters (sex, atopy, markers of autoimmunity, antithyroid antibodies, positive ASST result, Helicobacter pylori
infection, and hypertension) with urticaria duration was analyzed using semiparametric multivariable proportional hazards
models (Cox regression) using remission as main outcome measure.

Results: Apart from systemic hypertension (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.95; P=.02), none of the
considered parameters influenced CIU remission of our patients; 74% and 54% of our patients with and without hypertension,
respectively, still had CIU after 5 years.

Conclusions: Our results show, for the first time to our knowledge, that hypertension is associated with extended duration of
CIU. This observation, together with the previous findings that point to vascular and coagulation involvement in CIU, may

suggest a new approach to antihistamine-refractory CIU treatment, including adequate treatment of hypertension.

INTRODUCTION
Chronic urticaria (CU) is defined by the presence of hives,
usually on most days of the week, for a duration of 6 weeks
or longer. A careful history may occasionally identify external triggers, such as a physical trigger, food, medication, or
topical allergen; however, in 80% to 90% of adults and
children with CU, no external cause can be identified, which
is termed chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU).'* In the last 2
decades, up to 40% of patients have been found to have an
autoimmune component to their CU, based on antithyroid
antibodies (ATA),? autoantibodies directed against the IgE or
its receptor,'“ or, more simply, a positive autologous serum
skin test (ASST) result.° A possible role of Helicobacter
pylori infection in the pathogenesis of CU has also been
suggested, with controversial results.°7

The natural history of CIU is only partially known, and
reliable clinical or laboratory markers of urticaria duration are
not currently available. It has been reported that up to 40% of

patients with urticaria beyond 6 months will still have symptoms at 10 years.* In a prospective study, Toubi et al’ reported
that urticaria severity, defined according to Breneman et al,!°
angioedema, ASST results, and ATA were associated with
longer urticaria duration. In a retrospective study, Kulthanan
et al!! found that median disease duration was nonsignificantly longer in autoimmune urticaria, defined according to
ASST results, compared with CIU (450 and 390 days, respectively). The aim of the study was to investigate the effect
of clinical and laboratory parameters on urticaria duration in
a prospective study of a large cohort of adults with CIU of
moderate to severe intensity. We decided to consider the
hypertensive comorbidity as a factor that potentially influences urticaria duration. This is based on 2 considerations.
The first is that systemic hypertension is a common condition
known to be associated with a procoagulant state.'* The
second is the increasing evidence that activation of the coagulation cascade pathway may contribute to the pathogenesis
of CIU, particularly in antihistamine-refractory cases in
which anticoagulants have been reported to be useful in a few
mentions in the literature since 1977.'3!4

METHODS

Patients

A total of 228 consecutive white patients referred to 2 outpatient allergy clinics from January 2003 to December 2005

VOLUME 103, NOVEMBER, 2009

for spontaneous CU (defined by the presence of hives, usually on most days of the week, for a duration of longer than
6 weeks, associated or not with angioedema) were included
provided that urticaria was moderate to severe based on the
evaluation of wheals and pruritus. Pure physical urticaria
(such as cold or heat contact urticaria), delayed pressure or
vibratory urticaria, solar, aquagenic, or cholinergic urticaria,
and factitia or dermographic urticaria were excluded. Viral
and parasitic infections were excluded on the basis of a
detailed history, physical examination, and related laboratory
analyses, including stool culture for parasites. Food and food
additive hypersensitivity was excluded on the basis of history
and skin prick test results or specific IgE level for a wide
panel of food allergens and, when highly suspected, on the
basis of oral food additive elimination diet and/or food additive provocation test results.

The following investigations were performed in all the
patients: skin prick tests or specific IgE measurement for a
panel of the most common inhaled and food allergens, urine
analysis, full blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR), liver function tests (and viral hepatitis screen if necessary), thyroid function and ATA measurement, antinuclear
antibodies (ANA) measurement, C1 inhibitor assays (C3, C4,
and Cl esterase), and serologic testing or enzyme fecal immunoassay (Meridien Diagnostics, Cincinnati, Ohio) for the
diagnosis of H pylori.

Atopy was defined as a positive result on at least 1 skin
prick test or specific IgE test for inhaled allergens; the presence of atopic respiratory diseases (rhinitis and asthma) was
also recorded. Systemic hypertension, defined on the basis of
antihypertensive drug treatment, was included in the statistical analysis as a possible influence on urticaria duration. The
follow-up length ranged from 3 to 5 years. Written informed
consent was obtained from each patient, and the study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee.

Urticaria Severity

A simple scoring system, based on the evaluation of wheals
and pruritus, was used.'> Briefly, the number of wheals (0, none;
1, <20 wheals per 24 hours; 2, 21-50 wheals per 24 hours;
and 3, >50 wheals per 24 hours), their duration (0, none; 1,
<11 hours per day; 2, 1-3 hours per day; and 3, >3 hours per
day), and the severity of pruritus (0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; and 3, intense) were recorded by the patients every day
for 1 week, and the mean values were calculated. To be
included in the study, patients had to have a urticaria severity
score greater than 6 (moderate to severe).

ASST Results

ASSTs were performed in all the patients after antihistamine
washout of at least 2 days as previously described.’ Briefly,
0.1 mL of sterile autologous serum was injected intradermally, and the wheal size was determined at 30 minutes and
followed up for a total of 60 minutes. Saline was used as the
negative control, and histamine (1 mg/mL) served as the
positive control. The ASST result was considered positive

when the wheal attained was at least 1.5 mm greater than the
negative control.

Patient Treatment
Patients were treated with antihistamine drugs associated
with oral methylprednisolone when needed.

Follow-up

Follow-up visits were scheduled every 4 months by telephone
interview for patients who could not attend the visit. During
the visits urticaria severity, medication consumption, and
adverse effects were reviewed. Urticaria remission was defined by the absence of hives and angioedema in the last 3
months, while the patients were not undergoing therapy.

Statistical Analysis

To evaluate the effect of predictors on the probability of
urticaria remission, we used proportional hazard Cox regression models,'® considering age, sex, atopy, angioedema, ESR,
ASST result, liver test results, ATA, H pylori, ANA, C3, C4,
and systemic hypertension as predictor variables and using
remission as the main outcome measure and time from the
onset of the urticaria to remission or to last visit (censored in
that case) as the observation period (during which urticaria
could or could not undergo remission).The observation time
was truncated at 60 months, and events after this point were
considered censored. The final model was based on the
appropriate Akaike and Schwarz criterion.!’ Estimates of
hazard ratio (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for
true HRs were reported for each independent variable (predictor) in the regression model. A predictor with an HR
significantly less than 1 would be indicative of extended
duration of CIU associated with that predictor. Conversely, a
predictor with an HR significantly greater than 1 would be
indicative of attenuated duration of CIU. Significance of an
HR was determined as P < .05 in a 2-directional test. KaplanMeyer curves were constructed for the relationship between
urticaria duration and the significant predictor variables.'*

RESULTS

Clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients are
reported in Table 1. The mean age of the patients (166
female, 62 male) was 48.2 years (age range, 16—85 years).
There were 92 atopic patients (40.3%), and 65 (28.5%) of
them reported allergic diseases (rhinitis combined or not with
asthma).

Angioedema was found in 39.9%, a positive ASST result
in 33.3%, ATA in 34.2%, ANA (low titer, 1:80, mostly
homogeneous pattern) and minimal elevation of ESR in 21%,
and H pylori infection in 32% of patients. Systemic hypertension was present in 42 of 228 patients (18.9%). Full blood
cell count, liver function test results, and C3, C4, and thyroxine levels were normal in all the patients.

Relationship Between Urticaria Duration and Considered
Parameters

Remission probability was based on 7,855 total patientmonths and 82 events, giving a remission rate of 1.04% per

month. The median duration of CIU was 33 months (range,
6-60 months), and the mean (SD) duration was 44.5 (40.8)
months starting from the onset of symptoms and 31.8 (19.1)
months considering only the study period. Apart from systemic hypertension (HR, 0.71; 95% CL, 0.53-0.95; P = .02),
none of the considered parameters, including positive ASST
results, statistically influenced urticaria remission and were
excluded from the final model. The estimated effect of each
single factor is reported in Table 2. The proportion of patients
still having urticaria at each observation time was significantly higher in patients with hypertension compared with
patients without hypertension. CIU persisted in 81% and 74%
of hypertensive patients up to 24 and 60 months, respectively.
On the other hand, in normotensive patients CIU persisted up
to 24 months in 63% and up to 60 months in 54% of them
(Fig 1). No significant effect of antihypertensive drugs class
was found on urticaria duration (15 patients received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 16 calcium blockers, 12
angiotensin receptor blocking drugs, and 30 diuretics).

DISCUSSION

Our results show that CIU persisted in more than half (64%)
of adult patients who were prospectively evaluated for 5
years, and its duration was significantly longer in patients
with systemic hypertension, irrespective of specific drug therapy (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) than in
normotensive patients. The high percentage of persistent urticaria we observed in our patients is similar to that reported
by Sibbald et al, but it is much higher than the value of 14%
of persistent urticaria at 5-year follow-up reported by Toubi
et al. All the factors potentially involved in urticaria duration, including positive ASST results, did not significantly
affect urticaria duration in our study population. This is in
contrast with the results of Toubi et al,? who reported that
urticaria severity, angioedema, ASST results, and ATA were
associated with longer urticaria duration. Some differences in
patient selection may help to explain our different results. We
did not enroll patients with mild urticaria, which may explain
the lack of influence of urticaria severity on its duration in our
series. Furthermore, the mean age and female prevalence of
our study population were higher than in the previous study,
for which defined criteria for urticaria remission had not been
clearly indicated.

The influence of systemic hypertension on CU duration has
not been previously reported, probably because hypertension
had never been taken into account as a factor that could affect
urticaria duration. The biological link between systemic hypertension and CU is not currently known. Recently, activation of the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade has
been found in CIU, for which increased serum levels of
prothrombin fragments and D-dimer'?° have been observed.
Thrombin and fibrin degradation products have pleiotropic
immunomodulatory and proinflammatory properties, such as
enhancement of vascular permeability and provocation of
mast cell degranulation.?! Thrombin is also able to generate
CSa in the absence of C3, thus bypassing the entire first part
of the complement cascade.”? C5a has been demonstrated to

CU.** Systemic hypertension, even in its early stages, may
cause blood vessel wall injury and activation of the coagulation system.”*?5 Alterations in the fibrinolytic-hemostatic balance have been reported in hypertension, predisposing patients to a procoagulant state,'2?° and increased serum levels
of prothrombin fragments and D-dimer?>?”?? may be found
in patients with hypertension. No specific therapy for CU,
except antihistamine drugs, is supported by evidence.

Our results show, for the first time to our knowledge, that
hypertension is significantly associated with prolonged duration of CIU. Whether adequate treatment of hypertension
may be helpful in the management of CIU remains to be
investigated. Our observation, together with the previous
findings that point to vascular and coagulation involvement in
CIU, may suggest a new approach to antihistamine-refractory
CIU treatment, such as anticoagulants.*°
