Autologous Serum Skin Test in Chronic

Idiopathic Urticaria:

Prevalence, Cor
relation and Clinical Implications

Kanokvalai Kulthanan, Sukhum Jiamton, Taniya Gorvanich and Sumruay Pinkaew

SUMMARY Some cases of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) have histamine-releasing IgG autoantibodies in their
blood. This disease subgroup is called “autoimmune urticaria”. To date, the autologous serum skin test (ASST) is
the best in vivo clinical test for the detection of basophil histamine-releasing activity in vitro. This study aimed to
find the prevalence of ASST positive cases in Thai patients with CIU, to identify factors related to the positivity of
ASST and to find the clinical implications of ASST in CIU. A retrospective study was performed among 85 CIU patients who attended the Urticaria Clinic at the Department of Dermatology, Siriraj Hospital and were willing to perform ASST, from January 2002 to December 2003. Twenty-one (24.7%) patients had a positive ASST. There was
no significant difference between patients with positive ASST and negative ASST as to the severity of the disease
(wheal numbers, wheal size, itching scores and the extent of body involvement) as well as the duration of the dis
ease.

Urticaria is characterized by short-lived
swellings of the skin due to transient leakage of
plasma into the surrounding superficial dermis. The
mast cell is the major effector cell in this disease.
Numerous chemotactic factors, enzymes, cytokines
and proteoglycans exist preformed in cutaneous mast
cell granules or are newly generated from the membrane of the mast cells and can be readily released.
Episodes of urticaria occurring at least twice a week
for six weeks are considered to be chronic. After taking a thorough history and undergoing physical examination, appropriate screening investigations and
provocative test results, about 70% of the patients
with chronic urticaria (CU) were diagnosed to have
chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) as no cause could
be identified. Some cases of CIU were reported to
have histamine-releasing IgG autoantibodies in their
blood.' This disease subgroup is called “autoimmune

urticaria”. These autoantibodies were estimated to
be present in at least 30 percent of patients with
CIU.** Although, the basophil histamine release assay is currently the “gold standard” for detecting
functional autoantibodies in the serum of patients’, it
is a time consuming procedure and difficult to standardize. Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay and flow cytometry using chimeric cell lines expressing the human FceRIa may
be useful in the future, however, they still need to be
validated.” The autologous serum skin test (ASST),
which indicates the presence of functional circulating
autoantibodies to FeeRIa and/or to IgE, is the best in
vivo clinical test for the detection of basophil histaFrom the Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj

mine-releasing activity in vitro.’ ASST has a sensitivity of approximately 70% and a specificity of 80%
when the positive result is defined as a pink, seruminduced wheal with a diameter of 1.5 mm or greater
than an adjacent normal saline control injection at 30
minutes.’ Disease activity of urticaria correlates directly with the serum levels of the FceRIa autoantibody. Sabroe et al.*” reported that patients with
autoantibodies had more severe urticaria according
to several parameters than patients without autoantibodies. However, some reports showed no significant difference between patients with and without
autoantibodies, but those with autoantibodies tend to
have more severe disease.’ The ASST is useful for
patients with severe CIU and recalcitrant course under consideration for immunomodulatory _ treatment.'"!

To date there are still no data on ASST in
CIU in the Thai population. This study aimed to find
the prevalence of the ASST positive cases among
Thai patients with CIU and to identify factors related
to the positivity of ASST as well as clinically important findings of ASST in CIU.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This study was approved by the Siriraj Hospital Institutional Review Board. Records of patients
with CIU who attended the Urticaria Clinic and performed ASST at the Department of Dermatology,
Siriraj Hospital from January 2002 to December
2003 were retrospectively reviewed. CIU was defined as urticaria with episodes occurring at least
twice a week for 6 weeks without a specific cause
identifiable after full evaluation."”

Inclusion criteria were patients with CIU,
aged at least 18 years, and willing to perform the
ASST. We excluded patients with urticarial vasculitis, patients with predominant co-existing physical
urticaria and patients who were pregnant or in the
lactation period. All participants were negative for
hepatitis B antigen and antinuclear antibody. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients
before performing ASST. All patients discontinued
short acting antihistamines for at least three days,
and long acting antihistamine for at least sevens days
before skin tests were performed.

Autologous serum skin test technique

Venous blood was placed in sterile plastic
tubes and allowed to clot at room temperature for 30
minutes. Then the serum was separated by centrifugation at 500 x g for 15 minutes and kept in aliquots
for use in the ASST. Sample (50 pl) of autologous
serum and 0.9% sterile saline (for negative control)
were separately injected intradermally into the volar
aspect of the patient’s forearm skin with 27G needles, leaving gaps of at least three centimeters. A
skin prick test with histamine (10 pg/pl) was used as
a positive control. Areas known to have been involved in spontaneous wheals in the last 24 hours
were avoided. Skin prick tests with histamine were
interpreted after 15 minutes. Wheals and flare responses were measured after 30 minutes. A positive
ASST was defined as a serum-induced wheal which
was both red and had a diameter of 1.5 mm or more
than the saline-induced response at 30 minutes.*

The clinical details noted were a personal or
family history of atopy and the duration in months
since the onset of urticaria. The number and size of
the wheals, severity of itching and extent of body involvement were scored as follows: number of
wheals, 0 = no wheals, 1 = 1-5, 2 = 6-15, 3 = 16-25,
4 => 25; wheal size, 0 = none, 1 = <5 mm, 2 = 5-20
mm, 3 =>2cm,4=> 4 cm; itching, 0 = none, 1 =
mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = very severe; extent of body involvement, 0 = none, 1 = 1-10%, 2 =
11-30%, 3 = 31-50%, 4 = > 50%. Associated systemic symptoms and angioedema were also recorded.

Statistical methods

All statistical analyses were two-sided at a
95% confidence level using SPSS version 10 for
windows. ASST data for positive and negative test
results were analyzed for demographic data such as
sex, mean age (SD), days in a week with wheals,
course of disease, outcome of disease, personal history of allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis and
allergic conjunctivitis, family history of atopy, angioedema and urticaria with systemic symptoms.

In addition, positive ASST and negative
ASST were analyzed for their scores of urticarial

symptoms, i.e. wheal number, wheal size, extent of
body involvement and itching.

RESULTS

Eighty five patients were enrolled in the
study. Sixty-nine (81%) were female. The mean age
(SD) of the patients was 34.9 (0.9) years with a range
of 18 to 70 years. The mean (SD) total duration of
the disease was 15.6 (2.0) months ranging from 3
months to 9 years. Twenty-one (24.7%) of the 85
subjects had a positive reaction to the ASST. The
serum-positive group was composed of 16 women
and 5 men (mean age 38.8 years), while the 64
ASST-negative subjects were 53 women and 11 men
(mean age 33.6 years). There were 24 patients
(28.2%) with a positive family history of atopy and
19 patients (22.4%) with a positive personal history
of atopy. The ASST was positive in 8 (38.1%) of the
former and in 9 (19.1%) of the latter, which showed
no significant difference.

Table 1 shows characteristics of those with
positive ASST and negative ASST. There was no
significant difference between patients with positive
ASST and negative ASST according to sex, age at
the time of assessment, course of disease, clinical
outcome, personal and family histories of atopy and
associated systemic symptoms including angioedema. There was no significant difference between
the two groups in the total duration of the disease at
the time of assessment. The mean total duration of
the group with positive ASST was 14.3 months and
of the group with negative ASST was 16.1 months.
There was no significant difference between the two
groups in the mean number of days with wheals (frequency) per week.

Table 2 compares the scores of the urticarial
symptoms of the patients with positive ASST to
those with negative ASST. There was no significant
difference between patients with positive ASST and
negative ASST as to the wheal number, wheal size,
itching scores and the extent of body involvement.

There was no relationship between wheal diameter of positive ASST and severity (body surface
area of urticaria) (p = 0.8), or wheal diameter of
positive ASST and duration of disease (p = 0.9).
Also, there was no significant difference of wheal

size of positive ASST among chronic urticaria patients whose disease was cleared (mean wheal size
6.1) or not improved (mean wheal size 3.5) (p = 0.1).
The prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies in patients
with positive ASST was 9.5% and in those with
negative ASST 3.1%. However, there was no statistically significant difference (p = 0.23).

DISCUSSION

The prevalence of ASST positive cases
among Thai patients with CIU in our study was
24.7%. Sabroe et al.® reported that one-third of their
patients with CIU had circulating functional antibody against the high affinity IgE receptor FceRIa
or IgE. Asero et al.'” reported that 205 out of 306
(67%) Italian patients with CIU showed a positive
ASST. Nettis et a/.'’ reported that serum from 42 of
102 Italian patients with CIU (41.2%) induced a
wheal-and-flare response. Bakos et al.'* reported 26
of 48 (54.2%) positive ASST in Hungarian patients
with chronic urticaria. Caproni eg al.'> showed that
23 of 68 Italian patients (34%) with CIU had a positive reaction to ASST. Vedanthan showed that 70%
(50/74) of adult American patients with CIU had
positive ASST. Zuberbier eg a/.'° reported the presence of anti- FceRIa autoantibodies in 17 of 48
German patients (35%) with chronic urticaria using a
sandwich ELISA technique. Sabroe et al.’ reported
that 33 of 107 patients with CIU (31%) had functional autoantibodies on the basis of the serum
evoked histamine release in vitro from the basophils
of 2 healthy donors.

The findings of our study agreed with previous studies of Caproni ef a/.'° in terms of the female
predominance of the disease (CIU) and the percentages of ASST positive cases. Our study also showed
no significant difference between subjects with and
without antibodies when taking mean age, sex distribution and clinical morphology of individual wheals
into account. The majority of parameters examined
to define the severity of urticaria showed no significant difference between patients with a wheal-and
flare response to ASST and patients with a negative
response, e.g. wheal amount, wheal size, area of
body involvement and itching. From our study, there
were no significant differences between the serumpositive and serum-negative groups with regard to

Sabroe et al.*” reported in 1999 that patients
with autoantibodies had more severe urticaria than
patients without autoantibodies according to several
parameters: they had higher urticaria scores; the
urticaria involved more sites; it was more itchy at its
worst; and there was a higher incidence of associated
systemic symptoms particularly flushing and
gastrointestinal symptoms. Differences between patients with and without autoantibodies in the number
of sites involved and in the number of systemic
symptoms were more pronounced for patients still
within the first 12 months of their disease. This suggests that patients with autoantibodies may have

their most severe attacks close to the onset of the
disease. However, even within the first 12 months of
the disease’s course, our patients with autoantibodies
did not have more severe urticaria than patients
without autoantibodies. Caproni er al.'* did not demonstrate any significant difference between the serum-positive and serum-negative cases with regard
to mean age, sex distribution, angioedema and atopy.
However, all patients with positive ASST presented
more severe clinical features than those with serumnegative.

However, Nettis et a/.'* noted that the majority of parameters used to define the severity of urticaria showed no significant difference between patients with positive and negative ASST. The only

significant difference they noted between the two
groups was the incidence of angioedema. Our study
results were similar to Nettis et al.'° except that there
was no significant difference in the incidence of angioedema between the two groups.

It was expected that the atopic subjects
would belong mostly to a less severe disease subgroup because it has been demonstrated that the
atopic subject’s trend toward high levels of IgE can
prevent the binding of anti- FceRIa antibodies to the
receptor, already saturated by immunoglobulins.
Our study like Nettis et al.'> and Caproni eg al.'°
showed no significant difference between the serumpositive and serum-negative groups with regard to
atopy frequency.

Bakos et al.'* reported no laboratory differences between the autoimmune and non-autoimmune
groups except for the basophil count. He observed a
relationship between autoimmune urticaria and autoimmune thyroiditis. Numerous studies have found a
prevalence of 14-20% of thyroid autoimmunity in
chronic urticaria patients. Positive autologous serum
skin testing was previously described in patients with
autoimmune urticaria associated with thyroid auto

immunity. In our study, the prevalence of thyroid
autoantibodies in patients with positive ASST was
9.5% and in those with negative ASST 3.1%. However, there was no statistically significant difference.

Routine treatment for autoimmune and nonautoimmune chronic urticaria is the same. However,
immunotherapies using plasmapheresis, intravenous
gamma globulin, cyclosporine and methotrexate
have been successfully reported in the treatment of
severe antihistamine-resistant CIU. Bagenstose et
al.'’ reported that only patients with autoimmune
chronic urticaria resistant to H\-antagonist monotherapy might benefit from the addition of the leukotriene D4-receptor antagonist zafirlukast to their
treatment regimen. These results also suggest that a
routine screening of patients with chronic urticaria
with ASST might be useful in formulating therapeutic algorithms in the management of chronic urticaria.

In summary, may be due to the limited number of patients, we could not demonstrate significant
differences between patients with positive and negative ASST.
