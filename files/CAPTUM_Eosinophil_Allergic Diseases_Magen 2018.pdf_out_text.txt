ABSTRACT

Background: Epidemiologic studies report that alopecia areata (AA) is related to various atopic and autoimmune diseases.
The purpose of this study was to identify clinical characteristics and the prevalence of comorbid conditions in Israeli patients
with AA.

Methods: This retrospective, matched, case-control study was based on data from an electronic patient record data base. The
patients with an electronically documented diagnosis of AA were included in the AA group. The control group was randomly
sampled from the remaining subjects, with a case-to-control ratio of two controls for each case. Comorbidity was compared
between the study groups.

Results: A total of 1751 subjects (49.4% men and 50.6% women), ages 34.9 + 17.8 years old, were identified. The control
group consisted of 3502 age- and sex-matched subjects. The AA group was characterized by a higher blood eosinophil count
(0.39 + 0.12 cells/mm) than the control group (0.31 + 0.14 cells/mm?; p < 0.001). In the AA group, there was a higher
prevalence of allergic rhinitis (odds ratio [OR] 2.15 [1.85-2.49]; p < 0.001), asthma (OR 1.57 [1.28-1.93]; p < 0.001), atopic
dermatitis (AD) (OR 4.17 [3.18-5.47]; p < 0.001), and food allergy (OR 2.79 [1.58—4.91]; p < 0.001) than in the control
group. The prevalence of organ-specific and systemic autoimmune diseases was significantly higher in the AA group than in
the control group, with the OR of having any autoimmune disease calculated to be 4.72 (3.99-5.57; p < 0.001). The OR of
having chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) with AA was 6.15 (4.06—9.32; p < 0.001). In patients with concomitant AA and
CSU, allergic rhinitis and AD were more prevalent than in patients with CSU in the control group.

Conclusion: An estimated prevalence of AA among an Israeli population was ~0.8%. The novel finding of our study was

the high prevalence of food allergy and CSU in patients with AA.

lopecia areata (AA) is a relatively common disease, with a global prevalence of 0.1-0.2%.1?
Although the etiology of AA is still unclear, experimental and clinical evidence indicate that AA is caused
by an autoimmune attack against hair follicles.? Autoimmunity largely arises from defects in immune tolerance, which results in the production and proliferation
of autoreactive T cells and autoantibodies.*~° The prevalence among different ethnic groups can be higher
than that observed worldwide, with an observed prevalence that ranges from ~0.7 to 3% in the United
States,” to ~2% in the United Kingdom.*
The lifetime risk of AA over 20 years was estimated
to be 2.1% in Olmsted County, Minnesota.” Although
some epidemiologic studies reported that AA is related

METHODS

Patients and Setting

This study was conducted by using the electronic
patient record data base of the Southern Region of
Leumit Health Care Services (LHS), a health maintenance organization that covers ~220,000 residents of
this region of Israel. LHS has implemented an electronic patient record system that facilitates the creation of a comprehensive data base that includes the
following: data on resource utilization of the covered
population, demographic data, records of clinical

March-April 2018, Vol. 39, No. 2
visits, laboratory tests performed at a central laboratory, diagnostic codes by using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, * hospitalization, imaging and drug prescription,
and purchase. This data base was mined to capture data
on relevant documented diagnoses and laboratory results
through cross-linking of a unique patient-identity number. This study was approved by LHS Institutional Review Committee.

All patients with an electronically documented diagnosis of AA during the years 2010-2016 were identified and were included in the AA group. The control
group was composed of a random sample of the remaining LHS members, with a case-to-control ratio of
two controls for each case (1:2). The randomization was
performed by using the Epi Info 6 software (Atlanta,
GA). Comorbidities were identified by using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical
Modification,"* for specific diagnostic codes registered
by the board-certificated attending physicians. A patient was diagnosed with a definite rheumatic disease
if he or she matched the diagnostic criteria of each
specific rheumatologic disease, for example, the 1997
revised American College of Rheumatology (ACR)
classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus,!> 1987 ACR criteria for rheumatoid arthritis,'© 2002
European criteria for Sjogren syndrome,’” 1984 modified New York criteria for ankylosing spondylitis, '®
and 1980 ACR criteria for systemic sclerosis (scleroderma).’’ Data capture was performed by using IBM
Cognos 10.1.1 BI Report Studio software (IBM Corp.,
New York, NY). A chart review of all identified eligible
patients was then performed to validate the cases retrieved by an electronic search. The final validated
patient population was accrued and recorded into Microsoft Excel (version 14; Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington) spreadsheets for analysis.

Statistical Analyses

Data were analyzed by using SPSS software version
18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The means + standard
deviations were calculated for continuous variables.
Statistical significance for categorical variables was calculated by using the x” test or the Fisher exact test. The
multivariate regression analyses adjusted for sex and
age (odds ratio [OR] with 95% confidence intervals
[CI]) were performed individually for each substratum
of comorbidity to eliminate potential sources of bias.
To prevent possible multiplicity issues, we applied a
Bonferroni correction testing at a significance level of
(0.05)/k (k - the number of independent variables /tests
in Bonferoni correction) to lower the chance of a type I
error. A two-tailed p value of <0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

RESULTS

Demographic, Clinical, and Laboratory
Characteristics of the Patients with AA and the
Controls

A total of 1751 subjects, ages 34.9 + 17.8 years old.
were identified with a registered diagnosis of AA between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2016. The
study population consisted of 865 men (49.4%) and 886
women (50.6%). No differences between male and female patients were observed with respect to clinical
and laboratory characteristics (Table 1). The control
group consisted of 3502 age- and sex-matched subjects.
The AA group was characterized by a higher blood
eosinophil count (0.39 + 0.12 cells/mm?°) than the control group (0.31 + 0.14 cells/mm*?; p < 0.001) (Table 1).

Allergic Diseases and AA

Significant differences in the rates of allergic diseases
were found between the AA and control groups. In the
AA group, there was a higher prevalence of allergic
rhinitis (425 [24.3%] versus 454 [12.9%] in the control
group; p < 0.001) with OR 2.15 [95% CI, 1.85-2.49], p <
0.001); asthma (173 [9.9%] versus 228 [6.5%] in the
control group, p < 0.001; with OR 1.57 [95% CI, 1.281.93), p < 0.001), AD (161 [9.2%] versus 83 [2.4%] in the
control group, p < 0.001; with OR 4.17 [95% CI, 3.185.47], p < 0.001), and food allergy (29 [1.7%] versus 21
[0.6%] in the control group, p < 0.001; with OR 2.79
[95% CI, 1.58-4.91], with OR 2.79 [95% CI, 1.58-4.91],
p < 0.001) (Table 1). No difference in the prevalence of
allergic contact dermatitis was observed between the
two groups.

 

Autoimmune Diseases and AA

Thyroid diseases were the most common autoimmune diseases associated with AA; 177 (10.1%) of the
patients in the AA group had Hashimoto thyroiditis
compared with 46 (1.3%) (p < 0.001) in the control
group. The odds of having Hashimoto thyroiditis was
8.42 times greater than in the control group (6.07—
11.74); p < 0.001) and OR of having Graves disease was
4.94 (2.78-8.67); p < 0.001) in the AA group compared
with the control group subjects (Table 1). As presented
in Table 1, the prevalence of other organ-specific and
systemic autoimmune diseases was significantly higher
in the AA group than in the control group, with the OR
of having any autoimmune disease calculated to be 4.72
(3.99-5.57; p < 0.001) for the AA group compared with
the control group.

Concomitant Dermatologic Diseases and AA

There were 79 cases (4.5%) of patients with chronic
spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in the AA group in contrast to 32 cases (0.9%) (p < 0.001) of patients in the

control group (Table 2). Although there were no statistically significant differences in the prevalence of concomitant autoimmune diseases, the OR of having any
concomitant autoimmune disease was 2.67 (95% CI,
1.13-6.32; p = 0.025) for patients with CSU from the
AA group compared with the patients with CSU from
the control group (Table 2).

DISCUSSION

Our study aimed to evaluate the comorbid conditions associated with AA in the Israeli population seen
in the southern region of LHS during a 6-year period.
There are two main findings in this study: (1) AA was
associated with a higher rate of allergic diseases, such
as allergic rhinitis, asthma, AD, and food allergy, and
with higher blood levels of eosinophils; (2) autoimmune diseases and CSU were more prevalent in patients with AA than in sex- and age-matched controls.
Indeed, many of these findings were confirmed in multiple previous studies, but the strengths of the association between AA and various comorbid conditions
observed in our study were somewhat different than
previously reported.

In our study, the estimated prevalence of AA among
an Israeli population was ~0.8%. Our study added
insight into the comorbid conditions that affect AA,
and, similar to previous studies, we observed that AA
was associated with allergic rhinitis, asthma, and AD."*
Previously, an important retrospective study evaluated
the prevalence of comorbid conditions among 3568
patients with AA seen at tertiary care hospitals in
Boston during an 11-year period and found a high
prevalence of comorbid autoimmune and atopic diseases in individuals with AA.7° Recently, the “Nurses’
Health Study 2” assessed the risk of AA and vitiligo
associated with AD in a large cohort of U.S. women.*!
The study found that AD was associated with an increased risk of developing AA and vitiligo in adulthood.”? It was intriguing that, in our study, the odds of
AD in patients with AA were higher than the odds of
other allergic diseases. Previously, it was indicated that
concomitant AD may indicate a poor prognostic value
for AA”°; nevertheless, our study did not include data
about the AD severity and/or phenotype.

The co-occurrence of AD with AA raises the question
as to whether these diseases have similar pathophysiologic mechanisms. Alternatively, shared genetics may be
responsible for these associations. For example, filaggrin

Allergy and Asthma Proceedings

gene mutations were found to be associated with more
severe AA.” There may be shared pathways that are
activated in these disorders, such as type 2 T-helper
(Th) deviation, Th17/Th22 cells,”* thymic stromal lymphopoietin,* and endothelin-1.7° Although AA has
traditionally been considered a Thl-mediated disease,
association of AA with atopic diseases*”-* and the
proof of Th2 cytokine responses in an animal model of
AA” verify the role of Th2 cells in the pathophysiology
of AA. There are few studies that support a possible
Th2 association of AA that have been reported lately.
Fuentes-Duculan et al.?” studied biopsy specimens of
pretreatment lesional and nonlesional scalp and of
posttreatment (intralesional steroid injection) lesional
scalp of six patients with patchy scalp and with AA by
using immunohistochemistry and gene expression
analysis. The study showed concurrent activation of
both Th1 and Th2 immune axes as well as interleukin
(IL) 23 and IL-32 cytokine pathways in lesional AA
scalp and observed significant downregulation with
corticosteroid injection in IL-12/IL-23p40, CCL18
(Chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 18), and IL-32.??
Sudrez-Farifias et al.7* performed microarray and reverse transcription—-polymerase chain reaction profiling of 27 lesional and 17 nonlesional scalp samples
from patients with AA for comparison with 6 normal
scalp samples and found that AA scalp transcriptome
is associated a highly inflammatory profile of Th2, Th1,
IL-23, and IL-9-Th9 pathway genes with heavy Th2
polarization, including “hallmark” atopic biomarkers.
In addition, our AA group was characterized by a
higher blood eosinophil count than the control subjects. Eosinophil infiltration into the skin lesions at any
stage is a valuable diagnostic element of AA? Previously, high serum IgE levels, eosinophilia, and infiltration of eosinophils in AA lesions were found to be
correlated with AA higher severity.*! Another finding
of our study was the higher prevalence of food allergy
in patients with AA, which, to our knowledge, has not
been previously described. We found only two case
reports on a patient with a combination of AD, AA,
and food allergy,” and of eosinophilic esophagitis in a
patient with AA.*° A plausible explanation for this
finding was that eosinophils express chemokine receptors, such as CCR3 (C-C chemokine receptor type 3)
and CRTH2 (Chemoattractant receptor-homologous
molecule expressed on Th2 cells), and, in Th2-predominant inflammation, their recruitment and accumulation may occur via stimulation of these receptors.*°
Our results were consistent with the previous findings of an increased prevalence of several systemic and
organ-specific autoimmune diseases in patients with
AA As in previous studies, the main association
for AA in our cohort was thyroid autoimmunity.*4
Recently, diabetes mellitus (both types) was found in
11.1% of patients with AA”. we also observed an in

creased prevalence of IDDM (Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus) in patients with AA and with an OR of 6.28
compared with controls; however, the novel finding of
our study was the high prevalence of CSU in patients
with AA that has not been reported. Several mechanisms
have been investigated as possibly contributing to the
pathogenesis of CSU, including autoimmunity.*° The autologous serum skin test (ASST) is considered to be a
screening test for autoimmune CSU because of IgG-antiIgE autoantibodies, anti-FceRI (high-affinity IgE receptor,
[or Fe epsilon RI]) autoantibodies, or both.*°

A negative ASST result has a high predictive value
for the absence of circulating functional autoantibodies, therefore, to assess the rate of possible autoimmunity in CSU, we compared the ASST positivity in the
patients with concomitant AA and CSU, and in those
with CSU from the control group. Rates of ASST positivity were similar in patients with CSU and with and
without AA. Recently, autoreactive CD4* T cells that
target FceRIa were detected in most subjects with CSU,
with a cytokine secretion profile typical of a Th1 cell
response.*” However, in biopsy specimens of CSU
wheals, Th2 and Th17 cells were significantly more
frequent than in controls.** Recently, we observed an
association between CSU and atopic diseases.* It is
noteworthy that AD is also accompanied by expansion
of skin-homing Th2 and Th22 subsets with lower Th1
frequencies.*° The presence of atopic diseases is significantly associated with risks of autoimmune diseases,
and the coexistence of AD, allergic rhinitis, and asthma
exacerbates the risk of autoimmunity.*!

Evidence that supports a genetic basis of autoimmunity for AA originates from multiple lines of epidemiologic and genetic studies.*? The first genome-wide
association study of AA involved a total of 1054 cases
of patients with AA (U.S. patients of self-reported European ancestry) and 3278 controls, and investigated
genome-wide significance for most genomic regions
implicated in autoimmunity and in T-cell—mediated
pathways.*° The study defined the genetic underpinnings of AA, which placed it within the context of
shared pathways among autoimmune diseases, revealed the upregulation of ULBP (UL16-binding proteins) ligands in triggering autoimmunity.” In a follow-up study, a genome-wide significant association
was found for IL-13 and KIAA0350/CLEC16A (C-type
lectin domain family 16, member A) as susceptibility
loci for AA, whereas IL-13 and KIAA0350/CLEC16A
are also susceptibility loci for other autoimmune diseases, which supports the hypothesis of shared pathways of autoimmune susceptibility.“

CONCLUSION
Our results, together with epidemiologic links between AA and atopy and robust genetic associations of

Allergy and Asthma Proceedings

an IL-13 pathway with AA further supported a feasible
pathogenic role of the Th2 axis in the pathophysiology
of AA. Therefore, there is a rationale for investigating
Th2-targeting strategies for patients with AA because
Th2-targeting strategy was found to be effective in AD
and asthma.**“° The link of AA and CSU may also
indicate that targeting FceRIa on mast cells and IgE
might also provide possible benefit in patients with
AA. Recent reports that antihistamines may be beneficial in at least some patients with AA emphasize the
practical clinical relevance of targeting mast cells in
AA**8 We suggest that more specific therapies
should be considered, including the use of bispecific
antibodies so as to selectively block mast cells.

The strengths of our study were that our team used
the electronically documented AA registry and then
manually ensured that relevant data were obtained for
all the patients. The main limitation of this study was
that, as a retrospective study, it may have information
bias because of possible inaccurate clinical records, loss
to follow-up, and missing data. Future prospective
studies should be aimed at closing the gaps of knowledge on the role of atopy and autoimmunity in patients
with CSU and AA.
