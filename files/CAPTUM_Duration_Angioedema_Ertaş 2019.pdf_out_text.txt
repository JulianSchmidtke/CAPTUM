Abstract

Background: Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU) is common, chronic, and debilitating,
and has serious effects on quality of life (QoL) and mental health. Three of four CSU patients

are women. The impact of CSU on female sexual functioning remains largely unknown.

Objective: To determine the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in female patients with CSU

and to characterize their impairment of sexual functioning and its drivers.

Patients and methods: Fifty-six female patients with CSU and 55 female aged-matched
healthy control subjects were evaluated for sexual functioning with the Female Sexual
Function Index (FSFI). Patients were also assessed for their duration, activity, and control of

disease, as well as angioedema, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and QoL impairment.

Results: Sexual functioning, i.e. total FSFI scores and all sub-scores, was markedly reduced
in female CSU patients versus control subjects, and two of three patients (67.9%) had sexual
dysfunction. Impaired sexual functioning was linked to high disease activity and poor disease
control. Sexual dysfunction was more common in CSU patients with angioedema and vice
versa. Angioedema was a significant predictor of sexual dysfunction in female patients with
CSU (Odds ratio: 7.3). Reduced sexual functioning was associated with anxiety, depression,
and fatigue and significantly linked to impaired QoL, more so in patients with angioedema as

compared to those without.

Conclusions: CSU has strong negative effects on female sexual function, especially in
patients with angioedema. Additional studies on sexual health in patients with CSU are

needed and should focus on the impact of effective treatment on sexual functioning.

80 co What is already known about this topic? The impact of CSU on female sexual

81 functioning remains largely unknown.

82 coo What does this article add to our knowledge? Our results show that sexual

83 functioning is markedly reduced and sexual dysfunction is very frequent in female

84 patients with CSU, especially in patients with angioedema.

85 co How does this study impact current management guidelines? Physicians who treat
86 patients with CSU should talk about sexual health and functioning with their patients
87 and should take sexual dysfunctioning into account in the management of CSU.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common, chronic, and debilitating disease that is
characterized by the appearance of itchy wheals and/or angioedema without definite triggers,
for longer than 6 weeks’ *. At least 50% of CSU patients have angioedema, defined as
swelling of the deep dermal, subcutaneous or submucosal tissues. Angioedema, in patients
with CSU, commonly affects the face (lips and eyes), hands and feet, and the genitalia’.
Angioedema can be painful and is linked to impaired quality of life (QoL)**. QoL in patients
with CSU can be severely impaired, and it often is*’. Many patients experience psychological
problems and psychiatric comorbidities such as depression and anxiety during the course of

their disease’.

Chronic diseases with a high burden for patients are linked to impaired sexual health

and sexual dysfunction?”

. For example, the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in patients with
diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, fibromyalgia,
asthma, allergic rhinoconjuctivitis and atopic dermatitis has been reported to be higher than in

the general population’ "”

. Sexual health in patients with chronic conditions including allergic
diseases is reported to be more impaired in female as compared to male patients'”'*. Female
patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, asthma, or vitiligo have higher rates of sexual

dysfunction than men with these diseases'*”?”!

. The drivers of sexual dysfunction in patients
with chronic diseases are heterogeneous and ill characterized, but are held to include disease
features such as disease activity and duration as well as psychological and psychiatric
comorbidities. In a study conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis, sexual dysfunction
was significantly linked to pain levels, the duration of the disease, and associated
depression’®. Vice versa, impaired sexual functioning has negative effects on quality of life
(QoL) and may increase disease activity by affecting sexual relationships and inducing

stress!!! 7?

The impact of CSU on sexual health has not been assessed in detail and is not well
understood. There are several reasons to suspect that sexual functioning is impaired, and that
sexual dysfunction is common in patients with CSU. CSU patients often have a high disease
burden’. The duration of CSU is long, several years in most patients, more than ten years in
one of five patients. Itch is a very common symptom in patients with CSU, and chronic itch
has been linked to impaired sexual health’’. Genitalia, together with the face and hands and
feet, are the most common sites of angioedema in csul*, Psychological problems and
psychiatric comorbidities including depression and anxiety are frequent in patients with
csu**, All of this suggests that CSU patients may frequently experience impaired sexual

functioning because of their disease, which is why we performed the present study.

Why does this study focus on female patients with CSU? CSU predominantly affects
women, and women with CSU may be especially at risk of developing sexual
dysfunction'**°, Female patients with CSU have higher rates of sexual dysfunction than
men’’. Also, female patients with CSU are more severely affected than male patients in terms
of their impairment of QoL”. Also, female patients with CSU more frequently suffer from
sleep disturbance than males”’. Female patients with CSU tend to more often have
autoimmune CSU than males”*. This is relevant because autoimmune CSU is associated with
a more severe course of disease and poor treatment responses to omalizumab”’”. Indeed,
women with CSU are more resistant to omalizumab treatment than men*’. Female sex
hormones are held to contribute to the high fluctuation of disease activity in female patients
and the burden that comes with this*’. For these reasons, this study is focused on sexual

functioning of female patients with CSU.

As of now, the impact of CSU on sexual health and functioning remains to be

investigated in detail and is not well understood. The aims of this study were, therefore, 1) to
138

assess sexual functioning and to determine the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in female
patients with CSU, 2) to compare sexual functioning in female patients with CSU and healthy
women, and 3) to correlate sexual functioning, in female patients with CSU, with
demographic and clinical parameters such as age, disease activity and angioedema as well as

with QoL impairment, depression and anxiety.

Study subjects and Methods

Study subjects and conduct

This study, in January and February of 2019, included 56 consecutive female patients with
CSU treated at our Urticaria Center of Reference and Excellence (UCARE)™. We only
included married patients between 18 and 50 years of age. All patients had wheals with or
without angioedema, i.e. we did not include CSU patients with angioedema only. Additional
exclusion criteria were mental impairment or communication disorders, pregnancy,
menopause, history of sexually transmitted diseases, previous hysterectomy or vaginal
surgery, history of cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, hematological, gynecological or
major psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorders, endocrine disorders
such as diabetes mellitus, and the intake of antidepressant, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic and
antiepileptic medication or oral/vaginal estrogen therapy. Our control group consisted of 55
healthy female and age-matched volunteers, all of them women without any health problems

who came to our hospital for routine health screening.

 

CSU patients and control subjects were similar in terms of age (37.8+7.3 and 37.0

 

+8.7 years, respectively), body mass index, the number of children, occupational and
educational status, and history of smoking (Table 1). Of the patients with CSU, 38 (67.9%)

had angioedema, at some point during the course of their CSU.

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Kayseri City
Education & Training Hospital and the local ethics committee. All participants provided

written informed consent.

We used the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) to assess levels of sexual functioning and
the presence of sexual dysfunction®®. The FSFI is a brief self-applied interview form that
assesses female sexual function over the past four weeks. It consists of 19 questions with a
total score range of 0 to 36 and six subscales: sexual desire, arousal, lubrication, satisfaction,
orgasm, and pain during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia). Each answer has point values from
0 to 5, where high and low values indicate normal and impaired sexual functioning,
respectively. We calculated, for each study subject, the total FSFI value and all FSFI subscale
values. Total FSFI values of 26 or less were taken to indicate sexual dysfunction, based on the

cut-off value of 26.6 established by the FSFI validation study®>.

Assessment of autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase and antinuclear antibodies as well as

total IgE levels

Patients’ serum samples were analyzed for autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPO) by
chemiluminescent immunoassay (Beckman-Coulter, Woerden, the Netherlands) and for
antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) by immunofluorescence microscopy using HEp-2 slides
(EUROIMMUN, AG, Luebeck, Germany). ANA titers of 1/100 and higher were considered
as positive. Serum levels of total IgE were measured by the nephelometric method (BN™ II

System, Siemens, Germany).

Assessment of CSU activity, duration and control

Disease activity in CSU patients was assessed by using the urticaria activity score (UAS) as
previously described’. Briefly, patients documented wheal numbers (0-3 points, with 0 = no
wheals and 3 = more than 50 wheals) and itch intensity (0-3 points, with 0 = no itch and 3 =

severe itch) during the past 24 hours, and we calculated the UAS by adding the points for

wheals and itch. In addition, we used a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) to determine patient
reported itch during the previous month (0 = no itch; 10 = maximum itch).

Disease control was determined by the use of the Urticaria Control Test cucTy***”,

The UCT is composed of four questions with five answer options each (0-4 points). High
UCT point values reflect high levels of disease control, and 12 of 16 possible points is the cut
off for well controlled vs poorly controlled disease.
Assessment of anxiety, depression, and fatigue

We used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a validated self-rating
questionnaire, to evaluate the presence and measure the severity of depression and anxiety in
patients with CSU. The HADS includes 14 questions with four possible answers options each
(points range from 0 to 3); seven of them assess anxiety with a range of 0 to 21 points, and the
other seven assess depression with a range 0 to 21 points. HADS point values in both the
anxiety scale and the depression scale can be divided into three groups; 0 to 7 points =
normal, 8 to 10 points = borderline case, and 11 to 21 = anxiety or depression”. However,
based on the results of the Turkish validation study of the HADS, =11 points in the anxiety
scale and >8 point in the depression scale were taken to indicate that patients had anxiety and
depression, respectively*®. A 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess patientreported fatigue during the previous month, where 0 and 10 corresponds to no and maximum
fatigue, respectively, and 5 cm was the cut-off value (>Scm was considered as high and <Scm

as low fatigue)”
Measurement of QoL impairment

We measured QoL impairment in patients with CSU by the use of the validated Turkish

versions of the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQJ) and the Chronic Urticaria Quality of

Life Questionnaire (CU-QoL). The DLQI assesses the effect of skin diseases on QoL and
consists of ten questions that cover six domains: feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and
school, personal relationships, and treatment. Each question relates to the last week and
carries the response categories: ‘‘not at all, = 0’’; ‘‘a little, = 1”’; ‘‘a lot, = 2”’ or ‘‘very much,
=3’’. The range of the total DLQI is 0-30 (0 = no impairment and 30 = maximum impairment

of life quality).

The CU-QoL measures urticaria-specific QoL impairment and has 23 questions and
six scales: pruritus, swelling, impact on life activities, sleep problems, limits, and looks. The
CU-QoL total value ranges from 0 to 100 points, with high values indicating strong

impairment.

Statistical Analyses

Parametric variables were presented as means and standard deviations, non-parametric
variables were presented as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR). The Kolmogorov
Smirnov test and histogram analyses were used to determine whether continuous variables
were normally distributed. Levene’s test was used for the evaluation of homogeneity of
variances. Number of cases and percentages were used for categorical variables. Two
independent groups of parametric variables were compared using Student t-test. For nonparametric variables Mann Whitney-U test was administered. Categorical data were analyzed
by Chi-square test. For the multivariate analyses, the possible factors identified with
univariate analyses were further entered into the logistic regression analysis to determine
independent predictors of patient outcome. Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit statistics were

used to determine model fit. A 5% type-I error was used to infer statistical significance.

Results

Sexual functioning, in female patients with CSU, is impaired, and two of three patients

have sexual dysfunction

Sexual functioning was considerably reduced, across all domains of sexual functioning, in
patients with CSU as compared to control subjects, i.e. total FSFI values and all FSFI
subscale values were significantly and markedly lower (Figure 1A,B). Two of three female
patients with CSU (67.9%) had sexual dysfunction as compared to 29.1% of healthy control

subjects (p < 0.001) (Figure 1C).

Impaired sexual functioning is linked to high disease activity and poor disease control in

female patients with CSU

In female patients with CSU, sexual functioning, based on total FSFI values, was linked to
disease activity (UAS scores): The higher the disease activity the more impaired the sexual
functioning (r = -0.363, p = 0.006). Disease control as assessed by the UCT was also linked to
impaired sexual functioning, the lower patients’ control of their disease the more impaired

their sexual functioning (r = 0.277, p = 0.039, Table 2).

Sexual dysfunction is more common in CSU patients with angioedema, and angioedema is

more common in CSU patients with sexual dysfunction

Of 38 CSU patients with angioedema, 30 (79%) had sexual dysfunction as compared to 8 of
18 CSU patients without angioedema (44%, p = 0.010, Table 3). Vice versa, CSU patients
with sexual dysfunction had angioedema almost twice as often as patients without sexual

dysfunction (Table 3).

Angioedema was a significant predictor of sexual dysfunction in female patients with
CSU (Odds ratio [OR]: 7.3, p = 0.012; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.56 - 34.26; Table 4).
Autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase, antinuclear antibodies, and total IgE levels were not

linked to sexual functioning and did not predict sexual dysfunction (Table 4).

Reduced sexual functioning is associated with anxiety, depression, and fatigue in female

patients with CSU

One in three patients (18 of 56; 32.1%) had anxiety, and almost half had depression (26 of 56,
46.4%) as assessed by the HADS. Both of these comorbid conditions were associated with
impaired sexual functioning (anxiety; r = -0.358, p = 0.007, depression; r = -0.370, p =
0.005;) (Table 2). Among the subscales of the FSFI, lubrication values were significantly
lower in patients with CSU who had depression (p = 0.042) or anxiety (p = 0.026, Table 5).
Depression was seen in 22 of 38 CSU patients who had angioedema (58%) vs 4 of 18 CSU

patients without angioedema (22%, p=0.012).

Female CSU patients with sexual dysfunction showed higher levels of fatigue as
assessed by VAS (median: 5, IQR: 2-8) than patients without sexual dysfunction (median: 2,
IQR: 0.5-4.5; p = 0.030). Of 38 CSU patients with sexual dysfunction, 14 (36.8%) had high

fatigue as compared to 2 of 18 CSU patients without (11.1%, p = 0.047).

Reduced sexual functioning, in female patients with CSU, is linked to impaired quality of

life

Reduced sexual functioning, in female patients with CSU, was linked to impaired QoL as
assessed by the CU-QoL (r= -0.314, p = 0.018) and the DLQI (r = -0.231, p=0.087, Table 2),
albeit not statistically significantly for the latter. Specifically, reduced sexual functioning

correlated with problems with social relationships (r = -0.409, p = 0.002), sleep (r = -0.324, p

= 0.015), keeping concentrated (r = -0.320, p = 0.016), feeling in a bad mood (r = -0.317, p =
0.017), using cosmetics (r = -0.313, p = 0.019), and going to public places (r=-0.264,
p=0.049). The two aspects of sexual functioning that were most markedly linked to QoL
impairment were arousal and orgasm (Table 6). The link between impaired sexual functioning
and impaired QoL was stronger in patients with angioedema as compared to those without

(Table 7).

Discussion

Our study has three major findings: Seven of ten female patients with CSU suffer from sexual
dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction is linked to high disease activity and angioedema, and it
correlates with significant and broad impairment in QoL. The results of our study are
alarming and must prompt a call to action.

Our finding that two of three female patients with CSU exhibit sexual dysfunction as
assessed by the FSFI is very similar to the result of an earlier and smaller study from 2007 in
which 70.5% of female CSU patients had sexual dysfunction as assessed by the use of the
Arizona Sexual Experience Scale”!. Also, our study confirms the results of a recent study that
showed that sexual functioning is markedly reduced in female patients with CSU and
significantly lower as compared to healthy control subjects, although female CSU patients’
FSFI values in this study were somewhat higher than in ours, 27.1 vs 23. 1°. One of the
reasons for this difference in absolute FSFI values may be the fact that the mean age of our
patient group was 38 years vs 35 years in the previous study. Older age is known to be
correlated with lower FSFI scores*’. Aother possible reason for this difference may be sociocultural differences between the patient groups.

That impaired sexual functioning is linked to high disease activity and poor disease
control in female patients with CSU does not come as a surprise. High disease activity and
patient burden are known drivers of poor sexual health in a number of chronic diseases
including diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis'*'*'*. A multicenter study on
sexual health in several dermatological diseases showed that impairment of sexual life was
strongly associated with severity of the disease and itch”*. Skrzypulec-Frankel et al. also
found a significant correlation between the severity of sexual impairment and the severity of
csu*. Interestingly, FSFI values were not linked to disease duration, suggesting that sexual

functioning is impaired early after the onset of CSU. The effects of CSU on sexual health,

therefore, appear to be different than those on mental health, as recent studies have shown that
depression and anxiety in patients with CSU develop gradually over time™*. The effects of
CSU on sexual health, therefore, appear to be different than those on mental health, as recent
studies have shown that depression and anxiety in patients with CSU develop gradually over
time. Allergists should consider to refer patients with CSU who exhibit symptoms of
depression or anxiety to mental health care professionals, and questionnaires such as the ones
used in the current study can help to identify patients who can benefit from this. Importantly,
our findings strongly support that CSU is associated with sexual dysfunction, and they
encourage studies on the effects of effective CSU treatment on sexual functioning in female
patients with CSU.

Why is angioedema, in female patients with CSU, so closely linked to sexual
dysfunction? This novel finding may be explained by the fact that angioedema, in patients
with CSU, often affects the genitalia and can be painful, although it is unclear how common
this is. In other dermatological diseases such as psoriasis, vitiligo, and hydradenitis
suppurativa, the involvement of the genital region is known to cause sexual dysfunction”?
In some patients, genital angioedema may impair sexual activities and sexual activities may
induce genital angioedema, causing sexual reluctance. Also, angioedema is often highly
frightening and debilitating*’, causes high levels of mental distress“, and reduces the quality

of life. This, in turn, can impair sexual functioning.

Our study shows that sexual dysfunction in female patients with CSU is closely linked
to anxiety, depression, and fatigue. In a large number of diseases such as ankylosing

Pe : : . «oa: 9-11,22, 40,41
spondylitis, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, and, very recently CSU,
reduced sexual functioning has been shown to be associated with depression and anxiety.

Fatigue is also known to be inked to impaired sexual desire and sexual activity'’. Kool et al.

reported that fatigue can predict sexual functioning in patients with fibromyalgia”. This link

bidirectional. All three can negatively affect sexual functioning, and sexual dysfunction can
contribute to depression, anxiety and fatigue. In a recent meta-analysis”®, for example,
depression has been shown to cause female sexual dysfunction and vice versa*®. As for CSU,
a better understanding of the connection between sexual functioning and depression and
anxiety needs come from studies that look at the effects of treating CSU patients for their

depression and anxiety on their sexual functioning.

Female sexual dysfunction is well known to negatively impact on QoL by causing
stress and affecting daily life and relationships'°''”*. On the other hand, impaired QoL can
decrease sexual functioning’’. In our study, the link between impaired sexual functioning and
reduced QoL was stronger in patients with angioedema than in those without. Together with
the fact that we found angioedema to be the only significant predictor of sexual dysfunction in
female patients with CSU, this strongly argues that female CSU patients with angioedema
should should be routinely assessed and monitored for the impact of their disease on sexual
functioning.

Our study has strengths and limitations. The former include that we comprehensively assessed
patients for clinical and laboratory markers, comorbidities and QoL and that we compared
them with healthy controls. The main limitations of our study are that it was monocentric and
that our patient population was, therefore, comprised mostly of women from one geographic
area and with a similar cultural backround. Additionally, our center is an urticaria center of
reference and excellence (UCARE) at a reference hospital, and CSU, in the majority of our
patients, is moderate or severe. Also, we did not systematically assess the previous intake of
medications such as steroids, antihistamines and proton pump inhibitors, all of which may

affect sexual functioning“®. Our findings call for global and multicenter follow-up studies that

include both genders, for example within the network of GA7LEN urticaria centers of

reference and excellence™’.

Our study shows that CSU is linked to sexual functioning in female patients with

CSU. Our results that sexual functioning is markedly reduced, and that sexual dysfunction is

very frequent in female patients with CSU should prompt physicians who treat patients with

CSU to talk about sexual health and functioning with their patients and to take sexual

dysfunctioning into account when making treatment decisions. Effective treatment of CSU

may improve sexual functioning together with anxiety, depression, fatigue, which, in turn,

may improve QoL.
