KEYWORDS Abstract

Acute urticaria; Introduction and objectives: Preschool-aged group is frequently affected by urticaria, and
Risk factors; infections are the most frequently documented factors that cause acute urticaria in children.
Preschool-aged This prospective study was designed to investigate the underlying factors of acute urticaria in
children under five-year-old children and to describe predictive factors for progression to chronicity or

recurrence after the first attack.

Patients and methods: Children younger than five years of age with acute urticaria were
recruited between July 2015 and July 2016. Patients (n=83) were grouped into those below
and above two years of age. In order to assess the risk factors for progression to chronicity or
recurrence, logistic regression analysis was performed.

Results: Upper respiratory tract infection was the most common detectable reason for acute
urticaria (49.4%). Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 was significantly isolated in the cases with the
manifestation of an acute single-episode urticaria (p=0.042). Angioedema and food allergy
were predominantly observed under two years old (p=0.001, p=0.006 respectively). A positive relationship was determined between the duration of urticaria and chronicity (r=0.301,
p=0.006). The absence of atopic dermatitis (OR: 6.95, 95% Cl: 1.35-35.67, p=0.020), negative Herpes virus serology (OR: 4.25, 95% Cl: 0.83-21.56, p=0.040), and unknown etiology (OR:
3.30, 95% Cl: 1.12-9.71, p=0.030) were the independent risk factors for recurrent urticaria.
Conclusions: Preschool-aged children with acute urticaria should be evaluated for infections
at the time of admission. Patients with unknown etiology, negative Herpes virus serology,
absence of atopic dermatitis, and long lasting urticaria should be followed up for chronicity
and recurrence.

Introduction

Urticaria is defined as a cutaneous illness characterized by
temporary, erythematous and pruritic wheals.' The accurate
diagnosis of underlying cause of an urticarial rash in a pediatric patient is required in order to prevent irrelevant work
up for self-limited circumstances and to determine the possibility of recurrence or the progression to chronicity. The
contribution of a precise history as a first step to establish the underlying etiology is crucial.2, The determination
of causative factors varies between 20% and 90% in different studies.* Infections, followed by food intake, are the
most frequently documented factors in children with acute
urticaria.*>

Urticaria is one of the most commonly encountered skin
disorders in the pediatric emergency department,° and
causes severe anxiety especially in parents. The identification of the underlying etiology of urticaria might be
beneficial for the physician in the management and follow
up of the patients, and may reduce the anxiety of parents.
The preschool-age group, especially under two years old,
is frequently affected by urticaria, and the prevalence of
urticaria decreases promptly in school-aged children.”

This prospective study was designed to investigate the
underlying factors of acute urticaria (AU) in under fiveyear-old children and to describe the predictive factors for
progression to chronicity or recurrence following the first
onset of acute urticaria.

Materials and methods

In this prospective study, the children younger than five
years of age with AU were recruited either from the Pediatric Allergy or the Pediatric Emergency Departments of
Hacettepe University Children’s Hospital. Patients enrolled
into the study between July 2015 and July 2016 and were
followed-up until July 2017. The diagnosis of AU was made
according to international guidelines.' Our study was completed in accordance with the ethical standards specified in
the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Hacettepe University. All parents
provided informed consent.

Patient population

The initial evaluation concerned administration of a survey including demographic characteristics (age, gender,
atopic diseases, family history for atopic diseases), symptomatology of AU episode (clinical presentation, duration
of urticaria, concomitant angioedema, fever) and possible
triggers (recent infections, drug intake, newly introduced
foods, insect bites, contact agents, any trigger that parents thought as the etiology). Duration of the urticaria was
defined as the period from the beginning to disappearance
of the lesions. Unknown etiology was named when parents
refused any exposure to environmental triggers and/or clinical or laboratory parameters revealed non-specific findings.

Children were divided into two groups; those below or
above two years of age, since patients under two years
are often affected by urticaria. All the patients were followed until hives disappeared and were called for control

visits three months after the first urticaria attack. Patients
were admitted to our department for a second control visit
after the first attack of urticaria. At the end of the first and
the second years; patients were questioned by telephone,
whether they experienced any chronicity or recurrence during the two-year follow-up period.

Definition of urticaria and urticaria activity score

Urticarial lesions with the duration of less than six weeks
named as acute urticaria, and lesion insist longer than
six weeks are termed chronic urticaria.® Recurrent acute
urticaria refers to occurrence of hives with a six-week
symptom-free interval of urticaria episodes.’ According to
the literature, we accepted recurrent urticaria as independent urticaria attacks with six-week lesion-free period after
initial acute urticarial lesions, and these attacks were also
no longer than six weeks. Urticarial lesions of the patients
were grouped as acute, recurrent, and chronic in this study.

Urticaria activity score (UAS) was adapted for AU, and
was calculated for all patients. This scoring system was
based on the intensity of pruritus and the number of wheals.
Scoring was grouped, according to wheal numbers, as: mild
(1 point: <20/24h); moderate (2 points: 20-50/24h); and
severe (3 points: >50/24h). Additionally, itching intensity
was evaluated as: absent (0 point); mild (1 point: no disturbance of sleeping at night but pruritus at daytime);
moderate (2 points: moderate pruritus at night); and severe
(3 points: disturbance of sleeping at night).'® UAS was calculated as the sum scores of the daily number of wheals and
the itch severity. '° UAS was classified as mild (score < 16) or
moderate/severe (score > 16).'°

Laboratory evaluation

Laboratory tests performed at enrolment were complete
blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), Creactive protein (CRP), and total IgE. Microbiological
examinations included sampling of urine and throat swab for
bacterial culture, stool for direct examination and parasites.
The most commonly encountered agents in acute urticaria,’
Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) IgM, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgM,
Mycoplasma IgM, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) type 1 and 2
IgM, were studied by Western Blot method in serum samples.

Skin prick testing was done on the child’s upper back
with a battery of 14 aeroallergens (house dust mites; grass,
weed and tree pollens; molds; cat and dog dander; cockroach) with positive (10 mg/ml of histamine phosphate) and
negative (0.9% sterile saline) controls after resolution of
urticarial symptoms and discontinuation of antihistamines.
Skin testing with food allergens (cow’s milk, egg white, soy,
peanut, walnut, hazelnut, wheat, sesame, lentil, chickpea)
was performed in infants younger than one year old or in
any case with the offending antigen if there was a suspicion
of food allergy. Skin test indurations >3 mm than that of the
negative control were considered positive. In the event of
any positivity on SPT and/or specific IgE (Pharmacia Diagnostic AB, Uppsala, Sweden) with culprit food; oral food
challenge was performed to confirm food allergy diagnosis.
Based on to the patient’s history, if the suspected trigger of
urticaria was a drug; skin prick and intradermal tests with

the culprit drug were performed according to a validated or
previously published skin test protocol that was available
for the respective drug.'' In cases of negative skin tests
or unavailability of the injectable form of the drug, oral
Provocation test was performed with the culprit drug with
increasing doses at appropriate time points. '?

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22 software
program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Variables were investigated using visual and analytic methods to determine
whether or not they were normally distributed. Quantitative
variables were non-normally distributed and expressed as
median [(Interquartile Range (IQR)]. Comparisons of quantitative variables were performed using Mann-Whitney U
test. In order to assess the risk factors for progression to
chronicity or recurrence, initially univariate logistic regression analysis was performed. Then, using the significant
variables (p< 0.20), multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed and odds ratios (ORs) with relevant 95%
confidence intervals (Cls) were calculated. While investigating the associations between non-normally distributed
and/or ordinal variables, the correlation coefficients and
their significance were calculated using the Spearman test.
A p value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

Results
Demographics

Eighty-three preschool children with AU [2.12 (1.27-3.39)
years old, male 59%] were included in the study (Table 1).
The median duration of wheals was five days (IQR: 3-10),
whereas 28 children (34%) had urticaria lasting longer than
seven days. Twenty-three patients (28%) had accompanying
angioedema, and three patients had anaphylaxis. Forty-nine
children (59%) had urticaria only once, 28 (34%) had recurrence, and six of the patients (7%) experienced chronicity
(Fig. 1).

Of the 83 patients, 16 (19.3%) had a history of recurrent wheezing, and 17 (20.5%) had atopic dermatitis. The
presumptive cause was determined in 68.7% (n=57) of the

(n=46, 80.7%) (Fig. 2). Other identified underlying factors
are listed in Table 1.

Infectious etiology

Forty-six children (55.4%) had various symptoms of infections, however microbiological causes remained unknown in
half of the cases. Apparent upper respiratory tract infection
(URTI) (n=44, 97.6%) was the most common type of infection. Infectious microorganism was shown in 23 out of 46
patients (50%). The remaining 23 patients without positive
serology or culture had symptoms such as fever, cough, nasal
discharge, sneezing, sore throat, and diagnosed as URTI or
lower respiratory tract infection according to the symptoms

pneumonia (n=2) were identified in serum or throat swab
samples (Table 2). HSV1 was significantly isolated in patients
with acute single-episode urticaria (p = 0.042). No vesicular
lesions were observed on skin or mucosal surfaces of patients
with positive HSV type 1 serology.

Acute phase reactants (APRs) and patients’
outcome

CRP levels [median=0.20mg/L (IQR: 0.10-0.24),
(p=0.021)] and platelet counts [median =243.000/mm?
(IQR: 202.500-340.250), (p=0.027)] were lower in

patients who progressed to chronic urticaria than the
acute/recurrent type. In addition, a positive relation
between CRP level [median=0.59 mg/L (IQR: 0.24-1.21)]
and AU was determined (r=0.262, p=0.022).

Urticaria activity score (UAS)

The median of UAS was 15 (8-21), and 55.4% of children
(n= 46) had mild urticaria (UAS < 16). Higher UAS, indicative
of an increased disease severity, was associated with longer
duration of urticaria (r=0.578, p< 0.001) but not with recurrent urticaria (r=0.005, p=0.966) or progression to chronic
urticaria (r=0.044, p=0.69).

Age groups

We divided the study population into two subgroups as below
(n=38, 65.7% male) or above two years old (n=45, 53.3%
male). The co-existence of angioedema with urticaria was
observed in twenty-three children, and 87% of them (n= 20)
were under two years old (p=0.001). Angioedema involved
lips in 47.8% of the cases (n=11), followed by extremities
(n=7, 30.5%). All patients with food allergy were under two
years old (p=0.006).

Progression to chronic/recurrent urticaria

Overall, chronicity or recurrence was accounted for in
41% (n= 34) of the study group. Recurrent urticaria (n= 28)
occurred more often in the patients without an identifiable
etiology (n=26) (p=0.008), and in patients with negative Herpesvirus serology (p=0.032). Urticaria developed
only once in children with positive Herpesvirus serology
(p=0.027). We encountered that progression toward recurrence was observed in patients who experienced first
urticaria onset in summer (p=0.008). In contrast, patients
with first onset in winter had no recurrence (p=0.004).
Furthermore, positive Herpesvirus serology was significantly documented in patients with urticaria onset in winter
(p=0.036).

As was expected, urticaria lasted more than seven days
in patients with chronicity (r=0.293, p=0.007). A positive relationship was determined between the duration of
urticaria and chronicity (r=0.301, p=0.006). Intestinal parasite was identified in one patient, in whom Blastocystisi
hominis was isolated in stool sample, and urticaria occurred
only once in that case. Aeroallergen or food sensitizations
were not found to be related to recurrence or chronicity.

Risk factors

In univariate and multivariate analysis, the independent risk
factors for the recurrence were the absence of AD (OR: 6.95,
95% Cl: 1.35-35.67, p=0.020), negative Herpesvirus serology (OR: 4.25, 95% Cl: 0.83-21.56, p=0.040), and unknown
etiology (OR: 3.30, 95% Cl: 1.12-9.71, p=0.030). However,
we were not able to demonstrate any risk factors for chronicity (Table 3).

Discussion

AU is frequently seen in pre-school children, but little is
known about the underlying factors and prognosis relevant
to this age group.’ In this study, we focused on the triggering
‘actors and identified the independent predictors that can
be used for the estimation of progression to chronic and
recurrent urticaria in small children.
The underlying etiology was found in nearly 70% of
the patients in contrast to the previous studies having
higher ratios.° Infection was the most frequently determined
inciting reason that constituted half of the identifiable etiologies, a fact stated in several reports,’ which was also
accompanied by the increased CRP levels and thrombocyte
counts. The outcome of our study in regard to the higher CRP
evels in AU was in agreement with a previous study, which
reported that higher values of APRs were observed in acute
urticaria rather than the chronic type.'? High CRP levels in
single acute urticaria were possibly due to the significant
correlation of infections detected at the time of the acute
attacks. URTI was the leading infection that the physicians
diagnosed. '4 The study of Konstantinou et al. revealed that
the seasonal pattern of AU attacks coincided with the respiratory tract infection outbreaks.* According to our study,
HSV1 was the mostly isolated infectious agent followed by
EBV, group A beta hemolytic streptococcus, and Mycoplasma
Pneumonia. In recent publications, HSV has been incriminated as an important causative agent in urticaria.’ It has
been demonstrated that HSV has the capability of driving the
immune system toward the allergic pathway,'® and therefore determination of HSV as the most frequently isolated
causative agent in the current study is in agreement with
that outcome.

According to the current study, approximately 41% of
the patients progressed to chronicity and recurrence. There
were few reports regarding the prognosis of AU both in

 

adults and children,°''® and it was indicated that this ratio
was 20-30% in children.®'” Recurrent urticaria was observed
mainly in children, who experienced the first onset in
summer, and which was less associated with infections.
Moreover, positive Herpesvirus serology as etiology was
mostly identified in patients with single-episode AU in winter. As a result of the multivariate analysis, the absence
of AD, negative Herpesvirus serology and unknown etiology were shown to be the independent risk factors for
recurrence. Additionally, all of the six patients who progressed to chronicity had negative Herpesvirus serology in
the current study. These outcomes contradict previous studjes speculating that viral infections are the cause of the
flare-ups in recurrent urticaria.?'? On the other hand, the
study by Legrain et al. reported a similar outcome that
the underlying etiology remained unknown in recurrent or
chronic urticaria.'® Possible reasons for chronic and recurrent urticaria, as we have seen in our study, are not only
explained by the isolation of infectious agents, but are also
believed to have a more complex pathogenesis.'? Future
research will help to elucidate the conflicting results of
he effects of the viral agents on the prognosis of AU
in a small pediatric age group. According to the current
tudy, the absence of AD was a risk factor for recurence. The use of antihistamines and topical corticosteroids
ntermittently in patients with AD may be a reason for
his outcome in recurrent urticaria. In previous studies,
on-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug hypersensitivity, food
llergy, the initiation of treatment after one week, and
he requirement of medications other than antihistamines
ave been identified as poor prognostic factors for AU.'%?°
However, here we did not observe find those parameters
to be the risk factors for recurrence or chronicity. To
the best of our knowledge, this is one of the very few
studies regarding the prognosis of AU and the risk factors in progression toward recurrence and chronicity in

small children. For this reason, we strongly believe that
the current study may guide physicians for constituting
a new perspective during the follow-up of children with
AU.

UAS is a scoring system developed for chronic urticaria,
which is consistent with disease activity, and correlates
with response to therapy.*' Although designed for chronic
urticaria, Liu et al. used this scoring system for AU.”? Based
on the literature, we implemented UAS to our patients and
demonstrated a positive correlation with a long-lasting duration of AU in concordance with previous reports.”* As the
severity of AU increases, so the disease lasts longer, therefore the scoring of AU with UAS may influence the treatment
and the follow-up preferences of physicians.

In childhood, virtually ten percent of urticaria coexists with angioedema.”* The most common reasons for
angioedema in children were identified as food, insect
bite, infections, and antibiotics.27 A strong association
between angioedema, atopic dermatitis, and food allergy
was revealed in small children.° However, such a clinical
relation was not demonstrated in our study. We observed
that most of the patients with angioedema were under two
years old. This finding was in total agreement with Mortureux et al., who reported that 60% of children aged one
to 36 months with AU exhibited angioedema.°

Previously, IgE-mediated AU was reported in half of the
patients,”* but in recent studies 3-10% of cases had IgEmediated etiology.'*?° The cause of AU was shown to be
hypersensitivity to either foods or aeroallergens in nearly
10% of our patients. AU induced by food is generally observed
in children under two years old, due to the introduction of
foods in the first years of life.??

There are some limitations to the present study. The
infectious agents could not be determined in some patients
due to the lack of the use of the respiratory viral panel,
which might add additional information. The sample of the
study population might be higher, however, we included all
children younger than five years of age admitted within a
one-year period. The major strengths of our study were the
Prospective design, the unbiased enrollment of patients and
the evaluation of risk factors in proceeding to chronicity or
recurrence.

The establishment of the precipitating factor in conjunction with the laboratory and clinical parameters may not be
possible in some children with AU. Herpesvirus infections,
especially HSV type 1, were identified as the most frequently
encountered reason for AU in small children. However, atopy
constituted only a small part of the identifiable reasons for
AU. Pediatricians should take into account the recurrent
nature of the disease in children with AU who had independent predictors for recurrence, including the unknown
etiology, negative Herpesvirus serology, and the absence of
AD, and should inform parents to prevent anxiety.
