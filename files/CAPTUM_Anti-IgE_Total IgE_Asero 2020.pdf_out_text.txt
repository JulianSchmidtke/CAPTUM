ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND: The response to Omalizumab by patients with severe chronic spontaneous urticari? (“SU),
may be rapid, slow, or absent. An early response has been associated with an IgE-mediated aut o-a, ergic

pathogenic mechanism, whereas little is known about slow and non-responders.

OBJECTIVE: To compare CSU patients responding slowly or non-responding to Omaliz mah.

METHODS: Forty-six patients showing a slow (n= 23) or absent (n= 23) response -2 G..1alizumab out of a
cohort of 170 patients with severe CSU (UAS-7 > 30) were studied. Several base ‘ine clinical and serological

parameters were compared in the two groups.

RESULTS: Apart from a lower prevalence of atopic diseases (p< 0.°°‘ a. da slightly higher prevalence of
thyroid autoimmunity in non-responders, the two groups were s “ilar in terms of clinical and serological

features. The majority of patients in both groups showed | w t useline total IgE levels.

CONCLUSION: patients with severe CSU showing a s..°W response or not responding at all to omalizumab
show impressive similarities. It is currently not nos.‘h’e to predict whether patients with severe CSU and

low IgE levels will show a slow response or ' wil tue respond to anti-IlgE treatment.

INTRODUCTION

Omalizumab has become an essential treatment for patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (C°."')
unresponsive to antihistamines even at higher than licensed doses (1). Anti-IgE is able to induc’: a1 ‘pid
drop in UAS7 levels in about 70% of cases (the so-called early or fast responders) and a slov. >r but equally
good response over 3-4 months in further 15% of patients (the so-called late or slow respi nv.ers; the
remaining 15% seem refractory to the treatment (2). Recently, several studies s!..w.1 a relationship
between baseline total IgE levels and the clinical response to the drug (3,4). Ww" ‘h th 2 possible confounding
factor of atopic status (5), average baseline total IgE levels are significantlv ve: in patients unresponsive
to omalizumab than in those partially or totally responsive to the drug. The -tetection of an IgE-mediated,
“auto-allergic” pathogenic mechanism in a large proportion of CS's , *tlents represents a reasonable
explanation for a rapid response to omalizumab by severely affec“ed patients (6). In contrast, much less
clear are the events occurring slow- and non-responders., rec =znt international, multicenter study (7) was
able to identify a specific subset of patients showin, :e. >r~.1 signs of IgG-mediated autoimmunity, including
IgG specific for the high affinity IgE receptor (Fcei. \ or for IgE, which were characterized by low total IgE
levels. Nonetheless, also these subjects might s + v a good, albeit frequently slow, response to omalizumab
in view of the multiple effects of this dri g which include among the others a down regulation of high
affinity IgE receptor on mast cells an 1 'sa: aphils (Reviewd in 8). To the best of our knowledge, CSU patients
showing a slow response to omali. ‘mab or not responding at all to the drug have not been analyzed vis-avis so far. The present study 2na: -zed and compared a series of clinical and serological features in these

two subsets of patients with LSU.

METHODS

The starting general population was represented by a group of 170 patients with severe CSU (UAZ 7 >
30) unresponsive to second generation antihistamines at higher than licensed doses submitted co
Omalizumab 300 mg/month for at least 3 months. One-hundred-twenty-four patients shov. *d a ,»rompt
response to the drug (i.e., a drop of UAS-7 > 50% one month after the first administration; ar.d were
excluded from the study. Sixty-thee randomly selected subjects from this group ‘er. used as control
group. The remaining 46 patients (M/F 13/33) who did not show any response |! mc nth after the first
administration were studied. Based on their subsequent response to Omali. ‘ab, which was assessed one
month after the third administration, patients were classified as late respu. ders (showing a drop > 50% of
baseline UAS-7 levels; n= 23) or unresponsive (no change in urtic7s12 acrivity; n=23) . The need to evaluate
patients after 3 administrations comes from the current Italian le,islation that forbids to continue
omalizumab administration beyond 3 months in the abser.-e o any response. The two subgroups were
compared for age, sex, disease duration, and for a<> ie. >* baseline laboratory parameters including ESR,
CRP, thyroid autoimmunity, total IgE, D-dimer, ai. ' atc pic status. Atopic status was detected by SPT with a
large panel of commercial extracts of both sea_ *n~.1 and perennial respiratory allergens (Allergopharma,
Reinbeck, Germany) that were carried o ut ara read following established methods (9). The chi-square test
with Yates’ correction, the two-taile (Scu.'ent’s t-test, or the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test were
employed to compare the two s.u.'v sroups where appropriate. Probability values < 5% were considered
statistically significant. The «uu, was approved by the internal review board, and all the patients signed an

informed consent to us z then clinical data in an anonymous form.

RESULTS

Table 1 summarizes the findings in the two study groups and in the control group. The two subset~ “id not
differ in gender, age, disease duration, prevalence of elevated CRP, ESR, D-dimer, thyroid auto’ nm ‘nity,
and total IgE levels. Further, no patient in the two groups showed sign of co-existing induct .‘° uw ‘icaria.
Patients unresponsive to Omalizumab showed a 3 times higher prevalence of thyroid a''vc m nunity than
late responders (9/21 [42%] vs 3/22 [14%]; NS). In contrast, atopic status was m. re ,-equent among late
responders (9/23 [39%] vs 2/23 [9%]; p< 0.05). Notably, the control group (i.e., the arly omalizumab
responders) showed a prevalence of atopic status and of thyroid autoimmu:.tv -hat was more similar to

late responders than to non-responders.

Total IgE levels were well below the normal range (i.e., < 50 U'/r |; no mal cut-off level 100 UI/ml) in the
large majority of patients (23/34 [68%]) with an equal dist. *hution netween non-responders (14/18 [77%])
and slow responders (9/16 [56%]). Median total IgE leve'> we. e 42 Ul/ml (5 — 1000) and 9 UI/ml (1-264) in
late responders and non-responders, respectively. Tac ditference, albeit clear, did not reach the statistical
significance. In contrast, the control group show'-4 — auch higher level of baseline total IgE than both study
groups. In total, 7 patients showed total IgF levels exceeding 100 UI/ml; of these, 5 were atopic: 2/2 in the
non-responders group and 3/5 in the slc w re sponders group. After the exclusion of atopic patients, the
maximum value of total IgE recordea : m »ng non-responders was 67 UI/ml, whereas among late

responders values ranged bet..>9 5 [U/ml and 442 IU/ml.

DISCUSSION

This is the first study comparing two minority subgroups of patients with severe CSU identified  , their
response to anti-IgE therapy, namely those unresponsive and those showing a slow response t’,
Omalizumab 300 mg/month for 3 months. Taken together, these two subgroups represent . hou. 30% of
patients with severe CSU undergoing anti-IgE treatment. It must be admitted that the nre. er t study might
show a partial classification bias. In fact, in some cases the response to Omalizui..ab “ay become clinically
apparent after more than 3 months of treatment; unfortunately, the current 1. lian ‘egislation does not
allow pursuing the treatment beyond 3 months in the absence of any apprec'3b e clinical benefit.
Therefore, it is possible that some patients that were eventually included « -1ong non-responders were in
effect very slow Omalizumab responders. Another possible bias i u.>t some patients might have
responded to higher doses of omalizumab (10). However, again 1. ° current Italian rules do not allow
increasing the dosage of omalizumab in the absence of ac ‘nici 11 response at 300 mg/month. Also in this
case it is possible that some omalizumab respondei~ we “e .nistakenly classified as non-responders.
However, in previous studies updosing of omaliz. nab was mostly successful in subjects showing a partial

response at 300 mg/month, which was not the -a¢2 in the patients studied here.

The most interesting finding of this stu 'v is :he similarity between these two subgroups of urticaria
patients in terms of both clinical and s *r-.logical features. Non-responders showed a higher prevalence of
thyroid autoimmunity, althour,.. “his was statistically non-significant). Interestingly, there was a higher
prevalence of atopic patie its .™0..g late omalizumab responders, which is a novel finding. This might
partially explain the dif. 2rer t outcome, since omalizumab in atopic subjects might have enough lgEs to bind
to produce a non-..ec‘*:c downstream effect in FceRI-bearing cells to which urticaria patients could
partially bene. “rom. In effect late responder patients were quite similar to the control group (i.e., early
omalizurr ak mr ponders) in terms of both atopic status and thyroid autoimmunity. With the exception of
atr >i subjects, most patients in the two groups showed very low total IgE levels, which is in keeping with
the observed association between elevated IgE levels and a rapid response to anti-IgE treatment in CSU (3,

4, 11). In effect, in a recent study comparing CSU patients showing a rapid or a low response to

Omalizumab the former showed a much higher prevalence of elevated total IgE (12). Both groups studied
here resembled those CSU patients with several signs of lgG-mediated autoimmunity investigated in the
PURIST study, who also showed low total IgE levels and a high prevalence of thyroid autoimmunitv \7\. Of
course, possible differences between the two groups in parameters that were not considerea “ere cannot
be ruled out. For instance, it would have been interesting to perform a basophil activatii n ce .t or the

measurement of FceRI, but these methods were not routinely available.

A rapid response to omalizumab occurs in the majority of patients with seve:. CSL, possibly as the result
of the blockade of autoreactive IgE (both circulating and bound to the high a. ‘ir ty IgE receptor on effector
cells) by IgG-anti-IgE antibodies (6, 8). The events leading to a slow respon. : or to the non-response to the
drug are less clear. In patients showing low total IgE levels and ar ig¢ -mediated autoimmune process able
to activate mast cells and basophils via the high affinity IgF recep. >r, either directly (by lgG-anti-FceRI) or
indirectly (by IgG directed against receptor-bound IgE) (13, 14) the effect of omalizumab might rely on the
down-regulation of IgE receptors, a process that wo id .>'2 some months of treatment to occur (8). Of
course, other mechanisms might also play a role. the se subjects, including a reduction in mast cell
releasability, an improvement of basophil Ig™ re-- ytor function, or a reduction of the activity of intrinsically
‘abnormal’ IgE (8). In non-atopic patient , shcwing elevated IgE, a slow response to the drug might be due
to the contemporary presence of Ig£ a 1a .gG-mediated autoimmunity (15). In contrast, the complete
absence of response to omalizurn.'* might suggest a pathogenesis that does not involve at all (i.e.,
bypasses) the high affinity = re. -ptor. In effect, some studies demonstrated the presence of circulating,
low molecular weight F starine releasing factors able to induce the degranulation of a human mast cell
line missing the Fc.’ ver aptor in the sera of CSU patients (16, 17). Further, Ertas and co-workers, followingup their CSU p>tie, *. treated with omalizumab found that in non-responders the drug administration did

not cause 1,‘ increase in total IgE levels (4), which is a common finding in patients treated with this drug.

In .>clucion, slow and non-responders to omalizumab 300 mg/month show impressive clinical and

serological similarities, including low total IgE levels. Therefore, it is currently not possible to predict
149 whether patients with severe CSU and low IgE levels will show a slow response or will not respond to anti
150 IgE treatment.
