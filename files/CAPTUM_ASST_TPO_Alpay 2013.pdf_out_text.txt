Previous studies indicate that 25-45% of chronic urticaria patients have an autoimmune etiology. Autologous serum skin test
(ASST) and autologous plasma skin test (APST) are simple tests for diagnosing chronic autoimmune urticaria (CAU). However,
there are still some questions about the specificity of these tests. This study consisted of 50 patients with chronic spontaneous
urticaria (CSU) and 50 sex- and age-matched healthy individuals aged 18 years, and older. A total of 31 (62%) patients and 5
(10%) control patients had positive ASST; 21 (42%) patients and 3 (6%) control patients had positive APST. Statistically significant
differences were noted in ASST and APST positivity between the patient and control groups (ASST P < 0.001; APST P < 0.001).
Thirteen (26%) patients and 5 (10%) control patients had antithyroglobulin antibodies or antithyroid peroxidase antibody positivity.
No statistically significant differences were noted in thyroid autoantibodies between the patient and control groups (anti-TG P =
0.317; anti-TPO P = 0.269). We consider that the ASST and APST can both be used as in vivo tests for the assessment of autoimmunity
in the etiology of CSU and that thyroid autoantibodies should be checked even when thyroid function tests reveal normal results

in patients with CSU.

1. Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria is a skin disorder which follows a course with erythematous, edematous, and itchy
plaques, almost daily, for over 6 weeks and which is associated
with lower quality of life affecting work and daily activities of
patients [1, 2]. The most important causes of chronic spontaneous urticaria include chronic infections, food intolerance, chronic noninfectious inflammatory diseases (gastritis,
esophagitis, etc.), and atopy [3]. No apparent cause is identifiable in approximately 70% of patients [4-7]. This patient
group, termed chronic idiopathic urticaria, is subdivided
into “chronic autoimmune urticaria (CAU)” and “chronic
spontaneous urticaria (CSU)’, and CAU accounts for 25% of
patients with chronic urticaria [6, 8]. There is sound evidence
indicating the presence of functional histamine releasing
autoantibodies or nonantibody factors (serum factor) against
the « subunit (FceRIq) of IgE or the high affinity IgE receptors

from basophil and mast cells in patients with CAU [5, 6, 9ll]. The presence of these autoantibodies is demonstrated by
papular and erythematous reaction by intradermal injection
of autologous serum or autologous plasma (autologous serum
skin test (ASST); autologous plasma skin test (APST)) [1214]. ASST is an in vivo test used for the diagnosis of autoimmune urticaria since 1940, and a positive reaction is detected
during the active phases of the disease [15]. Recently, Asero
et al. have reported that the APST is more sensitive than
the ASST but cannot be considered as a screening test for
histamine-releasing autoantibodies [16]. However, there are
few studies on this issue in the literature.

There are a number of studies supporting the relationship
between thyroid autoimmunity and urticaria [17, 18]. The
presence and severity of chronic urticaria in patients with
autoimmune thyroiditis have been shown to be significantly
higher than that in patients with negative thyroid autoantibodies and healthy controls [2, 19, 20]. The objective of
this study was to compare the ASST and APST used for the
assessment of autoimmunity in patients with CSU in terms of
efficacy and feasibility and to evaluate their relationship with
thyroid autoantibodies, thus enabling selection of the most
appropriate treatment protocol for each patient.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Patients. Fifty patients with clinically definite chronic
spontaneous urticaria, and 50 sex- and age-matched healthy
controls were included in this prospective study. The study
was approved by the Local Ethics Committee, and informed
written consent was obtained from all patients and volunteers
before study entry. A detailed medical history was obtained
from each patient and routine laboratory tests (hemogram,
total IgE, etc.), and physical examinations were performed
for all patients. In all cases, known causes of urticaria, such
as food allergy, additive in tolerance, chronical infections
such as dental infections or Helicobacter pylori infections,
and parasitoses or systemic diseases, had been excluded by
appropriate investigations. Patients with physical urticaria
were not included in the study. A majority of the patients
enrolled in this study had received at least one antihistamine
and/or mast cell stabilizer previously and received no benefit
from the treatment for a long time. None of the patients had
received immunosuppressive therapy previously, except for
a short-term systemic corticosteroid therapy given during
acute attacks.

2.2. Skin Tests. All patients in the patient and control groups
underwent ASST and APST as well as testing for antithyroglobulin antibodies (anti-TG) and antithyroid peroxidase
antibodies (anti-TPO). All patients were required to withold
antihistamines for at least 72 hours and mast cell stabilizers
for at least 1 week before the ASST and APST. Prior to the
test, adrenaline, injectable methylprednisolone and antihistamines were kept ready for the possibility of an anaphylactic
reaction. For the ASST, 5cc samples of venous blood were
obtained from all patients and healthy controls into sterile
glass tubes. For the APST, 5 cc samples of venous blood were
taken into sterile glass tubes containing 0.125 mol/L sodium
citrate, and the blood samples were kept at room temperature
for 30 minutes. Then, the blood samples were separated into
serum and plasma by centrifugation at 2500 rpm (Nuve NF
1200). In the active phase of the disease, 0.1 mL of undiluted
autologous serum, 0.1 mL of autologous plasma, and 0.1 mL of
saline solution were injected intradermally using a 30-gauge
needle, keeping a distance of 5 cm between the injection sites,
over the volar aspect of the right forearm, avoiding the areas
of urticarial papules within the past 24 hours. Histamine
phosphate, used as a positive control, was injected on the
volar aspect of the left forearm as a prick test. Test results were
measured at 30 min. The ASST and APST were considered
positive when an erythematous papule induced by autologous
serum and autologous plasma with a mean diameter more
than 1.5 mm or more than that of the saline induced response
was present.

2.3. Statistics. The measurement of thyroid autoantibodies
was performed using the Immulite 2000 system. Statistical
analysis was performed using SPSS version 13.0. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to evaluate the normal
distribution of numerical variables. Descriptive statistics for
numerical variables are presented as mean + standard deviation, whereas categorical data are presented as number and
percentage. The Chi-square and Fisher-exact chi squared tests
were used to analyze the differences between the groups in
terms of categorical variables and the relationships between
the variables. Comparison of means between two groups was
performed using significance test of the difference between
two means when the assumptions of parametric test were met
and using the Mann-Whitney U test when the assumptions
of parametric test were not met. A P value of <0.05 was
considered statistically significant with a confidence interval
of 95%.

3. Results

A total of 11 (22%) male patients and 39 (78%) female patients
with a mean age of 46.1+13.5 and 9 (18%) male patients and 41
(82%) female healthy individuals with a mean age of 45.1+9.5
were enrolled in this study. The patient and control groups
were statistically similar in age and sex distributions (mean
age P = 0.671; sex P = 0.803). There were no statistically
significant differences in thyroid autoimmunity and thyroid
function between the patient and control groups (Table 1).

A total of 31 (62%) patients had positive ASST and 19
(38%) patients had negative ASST whereas 21 (42%) patients
had positive APST and 29 (58%) patients had negative APST.
Fourteen patients had positive ASST and APST and 12
patients had negative ASST and APST. Seventeen patients
with positive ASST had negative APST whereas 7 patients
with positive APST had negative ASST.

In the control group, 5 (10%) patients had positive ASST
and 45 (90%) patients had negative ASST. The APST was
positive in 3 (6%) of the healthy individuals and negative
in 47 (94%). ASST and APST positivity were statistically
significant between the patient and control groups. ASST and
APST positivity were significantly higher in the patient group
compared to the control group (ASST P < 0.001; APST
P < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were noted
between the results of ASST and APST in the patient and

control groups (Tables 2-3). The compatibility of these two
in vivo tests, which are used in the diagnosis of chronic
autoimmune urticaria, was evaluated with Kappa test. And
the relation between the two was found significant. In our
paper, the tests were found to be %30 percent compatible with
each other.

No statistically significant differences were noted in the
duration of disease, duration of papules, interval between
attacks, and the association of angioedema between the
patients (Table 4).

The size of erythematous papule was measured as
between 6-20 mm (median: 11) diameter for ASST and 513 mm (median: 8) for APST in patient group. The diameter
of erythematous papule was measured as between 5-11 mm
(median: 6) for ASST and 5-10 mm (median: 6) for APST in
control group.

Three patients with positive ASST were positive for antiTG antibodies, and anti-TPO antibodies and these patients
were functionally euthyroid. No statistically significant dif‘erences were observed in thyroid autoimmunity between the
patients with positive ASST and those with negative ASST
(P = 0.695 for anti-TG; P = 1.000 for anti-TPO). There were
statistically significant differences in the relationship between
thyroid function (TSH) and ASST positivity and negativity
in patients with chronic urticaria (P = 0.049). Euthyroid
atients with chronic urticaria had a higher rate of ASST
ositivity. Three patients with positive APST were positive
for anti-TG and anti-TPO antibodies, and these patients were
functionally euthyroid. No statistically significant differences
were observed in thyroid autoimmunity and TSH between
atients with positive or negative APST (P = 0.434 for
anti-TG; P = 0.686 for anti-TPO; P = 0.254 for thyroid
function). Table 5 presents the relationship between thyroid
autoantibodies and ASST and APST responses in patients
with chronic urticaria.

 

 

There were no statistically significant differences in thyroid autoimmunity and TSH between healthy individuals
with positive or negative ASST and APST (Table 6).

4. Discussion

The “in vitro basophil histamine release test” remains the
gold standard for the detection of functional autoantibodies
in patients with chronic autoimmune urticaria. In this test,
human basophils from two healthy donors are stimulated
with patient serum, and the subsequent histamine release is
measured, and the presence of circulating functional autoantibodies is detected [21]. However, this test is not widely used
because it requires fresh basophils from healthy donors, is
time consuming, and may miss nonfunctional autoantibodies
5]. The measurement of the expression of CD63 and CD203c
by donor basophils after incubation with patient serum has
been described as a reliable novel method [22]. The modified
CD63 expression assay was found to be a reliable method
or the diagnosis of CAU [23]. The ELISA and Western
blot analysis can also be used to detect the presence of
autoantibodies; however, they cannot differentiate between
functional and nonfunctional autoantibodies and take a long
time to be completed [21].

The development of erythema and swelling following
intradermal injection of autologous serum in patients with
CIU is the first indicator of the presence of circulating autoantibodies in some patients. This observation provides the basis
of ASST used for the diagnosis of CAU [21]. The demonstration of autoantibodies against in vitro IgE and FceRI by
immunological methods in only some patients with positive
ASST and APST (25-50%) confirms that factors other than
autoantibodies play a role in the etiology [24]. For this reason,
a positive ASST is suggestive of autoimmunity; however,
the presence of antibodies should be confirmed by in vitro
tests [25]. The prevalence of a positive ASST result ranges
from 50% to 60% in patients with CSU [15]. Thus, the ASST
is regarded as a simple and cost effective in vivo test that
contributes considerably to elucidation of the pathogenesis
of chronic urticaria and can demonstrate the presence of
functional autoantibodies in parallel to in vitro basophil histamine release [21]. However, it has been suggested that the
high amount of bradykinin generated in the coagulation
cascade leads to release of proteinase enzymes that destroy
CSa, thus causing false negative results and that the formation
of vasoactive mediators while the serum is being prepared
leads to false positive results [26]. Because of these false
negative and false positive results in the ASST, Asero et al.
described the APST. They suggested that this in vivo test was
more sensitive than ASST in patients with CAU [16], which,
however, has not yet been approved by other authors [27, 28].

The APST was regarded to be positive according to different criteria in different studies. In some studies, the test
result was taken as positive if an autologous plasma-induced
wheal and flare had a diameter 3 mm greater than the control
{16, 27]. In a study by Godse, only one unequivocal whealand-flare reaction with a wheal diameter of at least 1.5mm
greater than control was taken as a positive test result [29].
In previous studies, heparin, EDTA, and sodium citrate were

used as anticoagulants while preparing plasma for the APST.
However, it has been reported that heparin inhibits mast cell
and basophil degranulation, thus leading to false negative
results. EDTA has also been demonstrated to cause false
positive results by leading to localized erythema and swelling
at injection site in the patient and control groups. All these
findings have pointed to sodium citrate as the most effective anticoagulant in the APST used for the detection of

autoantibodies in patients with CAU [16]. For this reason,
we used sodium citrate as the anticoagulant in this study.
Of the 50 patients with CSU enrolled in this study, 31 (62%)
had positive ASST and 21 (42%) had positive APST. In some
studies, the prevalence of ASST positivity ranged from 42% to
68% whereas the prevalence of APST positivity varied from
14% to 97% [25, 27, 29]. No statistically significant differences
were noted in ASST and APST positivity between the patient
Dermatology Research and Practice

and control groups (ASST P < 0.001; APST P < 0.001). The
compatibility of these two in vivo tests, which are used in
the diagnosis of chronic autoimmune urticaria, was evaluated
with Kappa test. And the relation between the two was found
significant. In our paper; the tests were found to be %30
percent compatible with each other. That is why these two
tests can be used in the diagnosis of autoimmune urticaria.

Some authors have attributed the high rate of positivity in
the APST to the differences between the individuals performing the test, the absence of a standardized method for the
assessment of the results, differences in patient selection, and
differences in the presentation of the results [28, 30]. On the
other hand, some authors have suggested that the APST is
more sensitive than the ASST in patients with CAU [16, 25].
All relevant studies so far have reported that both the APST
and ASST can be used for diagnostic purposes in patients
with CAU [16, 25, 27, 29].

Previous studies have emphasized that antithyroid antibodies (anti-TPO, in particular) and abnormal thyroid function tests are more common in patients with CAU [31, 32].
Even though the incidence of antithyroid antibodies has been
reported to range from 15% to 24% in chronic urticaria
in the literature, the frequency of antithyroid autoantibody
positivity has recently been reported to be 27.7% [33]. In the
present study, 7 (14%) patients with CSU had positive antiTG antibodies and 6 (12%) had positive anti-TPO antibodies.
Three (6%) patients in the control group had positive antiTG antibodies and 2 (4%) patients had positive anti-TPO
antibodies. No significant differences were found in thyroid
autoimmunity between the patients with CSU and the control
group in this study. Additionally, we investigated whether
there was a relationship between antithyroid antibody positivity and the ASST and APST in this study. No statistically
significant differences were noted in the relationship between
thyroid autoimmunity and ASST and APST positivity and
negativity in patients with CU.

 

5. Conclusion

We consider that the ASST and APST can both be used as in
vivo tests for the assessment of autoimmunity in the etiology
of chronic urticaria, and that thyroid autoantibodies should
be investigated even though thyroid function tests reveal
normal results.
