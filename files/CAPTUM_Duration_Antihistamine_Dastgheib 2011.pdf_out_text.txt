Abstract

Background: Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), a debilitating condition, is defined as having urticaria for at least 6 weeks
without any obvious cause. Antihistamines and steroids are popular treatments, but other alternatives have been evaluated.
Mesalazine may be effective in CIU according to its anti-inflammatory properties via inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase,
cycloxygenases, nuclear factor-kappa B activation, T lymphocyte proliferation and antigen stimulated histamine release.
Methods: Mesalazine was administered to 33 patients with CIU, starting at 500 mg/day with weekly incremental dosing to a
total of 1 g/day. The patients’ dermatology life quality index (DLQI) and symptom scores were recorded before and after
8 weeks of treatment. Screening laboratory tests before and during treatment period were performed. Results: Mesalazine
induced a statistically significant decrease in DLQI in 22 (66%) of 33 patients. It is also effective in reducing symptom score
in at least half of the patients. The success of treatment was not related to age, sex, drug history and atopy, but was related to
duration of the disease in reverse. Conclusions: Mesalazine seems to be a safe and effective therapy for CIU in reducing DLQI

and symptoms.

Key words: chronic idiopathic urticaria, dermatology life quality index, Mesalazine

Introduction

Urticaria is a heterogeneous condition that affects
15-20% of the population at some point in their lives
(1). It is classified as acute and chronic forms. Chronic
urticaria (CU), with accompanying angioedema in 40%
of patients, is defined as having urticaria for at least
6 weeks with symptoms present daily or close to it (2).

Studies have revealed that CU is a debilitating
condition and can cause as much psychological,
social, and occupational distress as patients who are
awaiting triple coronary artery bypass surgery (3). Ina
study of 170 CU patients from a specialty dermatologic clinic, patients with CU had impairment of
quality of life comparable with severe atopic dermatitis and worse than patients with psoriasis, Behcet’s
disease, and acne (4).

The three most common etiologies for CU are
idiopathic, autoimmune and physical causes (5).
Patients without any obvious explanation for the
urticaria are said to have chronic idiopathic urticaria
(CIU); however, findings suggest that in 25-45% of
patients, CIU is not idiopathic but is an autoimmune
disease (chronic autoimmune urticaria) (6). This
subset of patients has evidence of autoantibodies
like autoantibody to high affinity IgE receptor and
rarely anti-IgE antibodies (4).

Mast cells are the key elements in chronic urticaria
pathogenesis, whereas basophils should be regarded
as bystanders and serve as biomarkers in some chronic
urticaria subsets (6). The coagulation cascade, hormonal factors, and psychological status of the patients
seem to have roles in the course and activity of the
disease (7).

The efficacy of therapy should be tailored to fulfill
the expectations of the patient in both complete
protection from receiving physical symptoms and
normalization of quality of life (7).

According to the guidelines, non-sedating H1 antihistamines are regarded as first line therapy in patients
with chronic urticaria (8). Despite the use of antihistamines, some patients with CU remain refractory
to this therapy. Systemic corticosteroids are used
by many, but this is not a logical approach for long
term. Many alternative agents have been used for
patients with refractory CU including leukotriene
modifiers, dapson, hydroxychloroquine, colchicine,
calcineurine inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, and
omalizumab (9, 10).

Sulfasalazine is a drug used in the treatment of
inflammatory bowel diseases. It is composed of a
sulfapyridine covalently linked to 5-aminosalicylic
acid (5-ASA). Sulfasalazine appeared to be an effective alternative therapy for delayed pressure urticaria
and CIU (11,12).

Mesalazine, also known as mesalamine or 5-ASA, is
another agent used to treat inflammation of the digestive tract. Mesalazine has fewer side effects than
sulfasalazine, while it has profitable anti-inflammatory
properties. Commonly reported adverse effects are
hypersensitivity reactions (rash, lupus erythematous
like syndrome), hair loss and interstitial nephritis.
Rarely it may cause hepatitis, pancreatitis and blood
disorders. As a result of the small risk of kidney, liver
and hematologic problems, blood tests should be
taken before and after starting treatment (13).

The aim of this pilot study was to determine the
efficacy and safety of mesalazine in the treatment
of CIU.

Patients and methods

The protocol and informed consent were reviewed
and approved by Shiraz University of Medical Sciences’ ethical review board.

Forty-five patients with a diagnosis of CU enrolled
in this pilot study. They were selected from the
patients with CIU in Shiraz dermatological outpatient
clinic. They had history of the occurrence of close-todaily wheals and pruritus for durations of at least
6 weeks, without any obvious cause according to a
detailed history. The selected patients had normal
screening laboratory tests, including complete blood
count, thyroid function test, liver function test, stool
examination and kidney function tests.

The minimum age for inclusion in the study was
18 years. Both new and refractory cases of CIU were
included. Young patients, pregnant women or child
bearing ladies, patients with history of significant

cardiopulmonary, renal and liver diseases, patients
with history of hypersensitivity to 5-ASA derivatives
and patients with G6PD deficiency were excluded.
Patients with history of taking long-acting corticosteroids were also excluded.

Of 45 patients whom were selected for the study,
10 patients were lost to follow-up before receiving
complete treatment and 2 of them developed adverse
effects as headache and nonspecific skin rash. Baseline DLQI and symptom scores of these patients were
not included in the study. The study population,
therefore, consisted of 33 patients that tolerated
the drug without any side effects. The patient demographics and baseline data are shown in Table I.

After signing the written consent, we recorded
baseline data of the patients: age, sex, duration of
the disease, drug history, history of atopy and the
result of screening laboratory tests.

A 1-week, free of medication period, was followed
by 8 weeks active treatment period. Apart from the
first visit, each patient was examined at week 2 and at
the end of the 8th week of treatment period. On the
2nd week, patients were checked for any change in
kidney and liver function and blood profiles.

At the Ist visit and at the end of the 8th week of the
study, dermatology life quality index (DLQI) questionnaire was completed. According to the previous
studies, DLQI is a valid, reliable and clinically useful
outcome measure of assessing quality of life in CIU
patients (14, 15). We used the Persian version of the
questionnaire (16), in which reliability and validity

was shown in a study on vitiligo patients (17). It is a
10-question standard questionnaire with 3 points for
each question (max = 30, min = 0). The lower the
score, the less the quality of life is impaired (Table II).

Additionally throughout the study, all patients
recorded their symptoms in a daily form, which
used to calculate their symptom scores. The diary
included separate episodes of urticaria, intensity of
the pruritus, number of the wheals and sizes of them.
The forms were scored according to severity and
periodicity of urticaria (Table III) (18).

The mean total of weekly symptom scores were
used to evaluate the efficacy of mesalazine, at the
baseline (PO, NO, SO, EO), after 2 weeks of therapy
(P15, N15, S15, E15) and at the end of the study
(P56, N56, S56, E56).

Mesalazine, starting at 500 mg/day (with weekly
incremental dosing to a total of 1 g/day), was administered. No other concomitant medications were
allowed during the treatment period. In the 1st visit,
we recorded baseline DLQI (DLQIO) and baseline

PO, mean total weekly number of wheals score: NO,
mean total weekly size of wheals score: SO, mean total
weekly episodes of urticaria score: EO). In the 2nd visit
(after 2 weeks of starting medication), we recorded
primary therapy results (DLQI15, P15, N15, S15 and
E15). Finally, after 2 months, the patients were visited
again and final therapy results (DLQI56, P56, N56,
S56 and E56) were recorded. A diagram of the study
is shown in Table III.

Statistical analysis of the study’s data was conducted in SPSS program using paired sample t-test.
In all instances, p < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Effects on symptom scores (Table VI)

Pruritus. Mesalazine was effective in reducing mean
weekly pruritus scores of the patients. After 2 weeks of
therapy, there was a decrease of at least 50% in
symptoms for 54% of patients. Also, at least a 50%
improvement was observed in the end of the treatment period in comparison to day 0 in 51% of
patients. About 42% of patients had significant
improvement in this score in the interval of days
15-56.

Number of wheals. During first 2 weeks of active
treatment, 42% of cases experienced at least 50%
decrease in mean weekly number of urticarial lesions.
This reduction in number of wheals score in day
56 was shown in 51% of patients. Fewer patients
(27%) had significant improvement in this item in
the interval of days 15-56.

Size of wheals. In terms of size of wheals, in 60% of
patients, significant reduction was observed in the end
of treatment compared with baseline. In the 2nd week
of therapy, 39% of patients had at least a 50% reduction in mean score of size of wheals.

Episodes of urticaria. After 2 weeks of treatment, 39%

of patients recorded fewer numbers of separate

urticarial episodes. At the end of treatment, this
improvement became more evident (57%).

Follow-up

We followed our patients after this course of therapy
for 6 months and most of them showed recurrences
after cessation of medication (14 out of 18 patients
whom were followed). More than half of them
decided to start medication again (9 of 14) for other
on and off periods.

Safety

During clinical visits, no significant change in vital
signs, physical examinations and laboratory tests
occurred in patients. One patient developed headache
1 week after starting medication that subsided after
discontinuing the drug. Another patient, in day 4 of
treatment, showed a nonspecific rash in trunk. They
were the only cases that showed adverse effects and
were not included in the study population.

Discussion

Chronic urticaria is known to significantly impair a
person’s quality of life. Patients may suffer from
intermittent symptoms that interfere with their social,
sexual and emotional activities and status (4). It is
obvious that the treatment of CU should improve

quality of life of the patients and provide them with
a prolonged symptom control allowing them to return
to normal activity.

Our pilot study was the first to evaluate the efficacy
of mesalazine on CIU. We showed that mesalazine in
doses up to 1 g/day was effective and well tolerated in
the treatment of CIU symptoms. Moreover, mesalazine improved outcomes on a 10-item questionnaire
based on DLQI.

Sulfasalazine, in doses used for inflammatory bowel
diseases (starting at 500 mg/day with weekly incremental dosing to a total of 4 g), appeared to be an
effective alternative therapy for delayed pressure urticaria (11). One case series demonstrated that sulfasalazine can be a successful and safe treatment option
for the patients with CIU who have not responded
adequately to treatment with antihistamines. During
Sulfasalazine therapy, 74% of patients reported
significant improvement (12).

Mesalazine, another effective drug for inflammatory bowel diseases, has been used for the treatment
of psoriasis (19). As mentioned before, mesalazine
has fewer side effects than sulfasalazine and working through different mechanisms as an _antiinflammatory drug.

The exact mechanism of efficacy of mesalazine in
CIU is not easy to understand. Mesalazine is an
inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase pathway. Leukotrienes
are produced in the body from arachidonic acid by
the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase. In vitro and in vivo
clinical and experimental data have suggested that
leukotrienes play a key role in inflammatory reactions
of the skin (20).

Reversible inhibition of cycloxygenase-1, cycloxygenase-2 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of
activated B cells (NF-KB) was found in experiments
using different cell systems including lymphocytes and
polymorphonuclear leucocytes (21). Therapeutic efficacy of mesalazine rely at least in part on the inhibition of
NF-«B which controls many genes involved in inflammation and found to be chronically active in many
inflammatory diseases (22).

5-Aminosalicylic acid also inhibits T cell proliferation and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production (23). Its
role in preventing an increase in markers of cellular
activation, namely IL-2, has shown in several studies
(24). This is another possible mechanism of action of
mesalazine.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the
metabolism of prostaglandins and leukotrienes and
can act as second messengers. Scavenging of ROS is a
mechanism of action of 5-ASA that gives rise to its
anti-inflammatory effects (25).

Mesalazine is the standard treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases that

their autoimmune basis is evident. Of course, some
patients with CIU may have an autoimmune basis
for their urticaria. This is one possible explanation for
the effect of mesalazine in urticaria. Sulfasalazine
and its metabolites inhibited antigen-stimulated
histamine release from mast cells, but sulfasalazine
was markedly less potent than its metabolites (26).
In asurvey, 5-ASA caused a reduction of IgE-induced
release of histamine in human basophils and mast
cells (27). Therefore, it is possible that clinical
improvement seen with mesalazine may be associated
with this mechanism.

It is also worth noting that best results were
achieved after 2 weeks of therapy compared with
baseline, and it is obvious that those without improvement at the end of the 2nd week rarely improve with
continuing the medication.

An important point in selection of patients for
treatment with mesalazine is that according to our
results, one with a very prolonged duration of disease,
will be a refractory case to therapy. There is not a clear
explanation for this observation. It may be related to
the role of macrophages in autoimmune diseases as
they are involved in initiation of disease. Macrophages
are also the terminal effector cells of inflammation
as they produce cytokines and free radicals. Early
administration mesalazine suppresses macrophage
function and IL-12 production (26). It seems that
earlier initiation of treatment with mesalazine results
in better outcome at least in autoimmune subtypes of
urticaria.

In conclusion, this pilot study of quality of life
outcomes and symptom scores shows that mesalazine
lessens the negative effect of CIU on patients’ lives
and decreases intermittent symptoms interfering with
their activities.

We recommend conducting double-blind controlled studies for better evaluation of mesalazine’s
efficacy on CIU. It is profitable to test mesalazine as
an intermittent therapy for intermittent symptoms
of CIU.
