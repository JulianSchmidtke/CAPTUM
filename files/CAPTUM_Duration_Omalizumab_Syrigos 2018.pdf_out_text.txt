Abstract

Background Previous clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the antiIgE monoclonal antibody omalizumab in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) not
responding to antihistamine treatment. The primary aim of our study was to describe the
response patterns of patients with refractory CSU treated with omalizumab in a real-world
clinical setting.

Methods A retrospective analysis of medical records of 20 patients with refractory CSU
was performed. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory features were retrieved and analyzed
in correlation with treatment data.

Results Mean age of our patient population was 54.5 years, while the majority were
females (15/20 cases, 75%). Mean disease duration prior to omalizumab administration

was 21.8 months. All patients had a history of chronic urticaria, refractory to high
antihistamine and corticosteroid treatment, and responded favorably to omalizumab after

administration of a 9-day course of methylprednisolone (total dose of 188 mg). Late

response to omalizumab (after three-month treatment) was significantly correlated

(P = 0.026) with shorter disease duration before initiation of omalizumab.

Conclusion In the present series, omalizumab, either alone or in combination with a shortterm course of corticosteroids, was highly effective in resolution of refractory CSU.
Furthermore, disease duration prior to omalizumab had a significant effect on timing of

response.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), which has generally
replaced the former term chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), is
defined by the presence of pruritic wheals (hives), angioedema,
or both, that persist or recur for a period of at least 6 weeks
and do not seem to be induced by any apparent external stimuli"? The severity and duration of CSU may vary greatly among
patients, while its impact on quality of life can be significant,
especially in the presence of concurrent angioedema and when
symptoms last for several years or fail to adequately respond to
standard therapeutic interventions.* ©

According to the latest international guidelines, daily administration of nonsedating, second-generation, H1-antihistamines is
the “gold-standard” first-line treatment of CSU, while dose-escalation (up to fourfold the licensed daily dose) of H1-antihistamines is typically followed as a second-line approach when
symptoms persist for more than 2 weeks after the initial

treatment course.':?” The use of sedating, first-generation antihistamines for CSU treatment has been largely abandoned, particularly in Europe.” Administration of these drugs (at bedtime
only) is nevertheless included, as an alternative to dose
advancement of H1-antihistamines, in the US guidelines, while
addition of another second-generation antihistamine or an
H2-antagonist are among the second-line treatment options recommended by both British and US associations.” A subset of
patients, comprising approximately one-third of all cases, may
nevertheless remain symptomatic despite use of the above therapeutic measures, suggesting the suboptimal effectiveness of
antihistamines in CSU.®

Previous clinical trials — including the pivotal ASTERIA | and
Il and GLACIAL studies®"' — and a recent meta-analysis of
clinical trial data’? have all supported that the humanized antiIgE monoclonal antibody omalizumab may represent a safe and
effective third- or fourth-line treatment option in cases with CSU
refractory to standard antihistamine treatment. Real-world data

on the safety and efficacy of omalizumab in this patient population are nevertheless limited, while other clinically significant
aspects, such as prediction of the timing of response to omalizumab, remain essentially unexplored.

The primary objective of our study was to further describe
the response patterns to omalizumab in a real-world population
of patients with refractory CSU, based on the experience of our
department. The secondary objective was to identify potential
clinical and laboratory predictors of response and timing of
response to omalizumab treatment.

Materials and methods

Patient population and study design

This study is a retrospective case series of patients with
refractory CSU, diagnosed and treated in the Allergy
Department of Sotiria Athens General Hospital, between
January 2014 and December 2016. Diagnosis of CSU was
made by an experienced allergist/immunologist and was based
on previously published guidelines. Patient inclusion criteria
were predefined as follows: clinician-confirmed diagnosis of
CSU; persistence or recurrence of symptoms for at least

4 weeks after updosing (fourfold the licensed dose) of secondgeneration nonsedating H1-antihistamines and administration of
repeated courses of oral corticosteroids; omalizumab
administration. Patients with inducible urticarias or those who
had not received oral corticosteroids for symptomatic control
were excluded.

The medical records of all identified cases were reviewed;
extracted data included age at diagnosis, gender, disease
duration (from onset of symptoms to omalizumab
administration), presence of angioedema, history of clinically
relevant comorbidities, laboratory testing results, including total
immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, C-reactive protein (CRP),
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and thyroid stimulation
hormone (TSH) levels, antinuclear (ANA) and antithyroid
antibodies status, autologous skin serum test (ASST) results,
and treatment data (treatment response to omalizumab, number
of omalizumab doses at the time point of best response, total
number of omaliumab doses administered, corticosteroids
administration and follow-up time). All laboratory values were
measured using standardized laboratory procedures. ASST was
performed according to the technique previously described by
Sabroe et al.'®

Assessment of CSU activity and definitions of response
Weekly Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) was used for the
assessment of urticaria severity (prior to omalizumab
administration), with scores ranging from 0 (no pruritus, no
hives for a period longer than 7 days) to 28-42 (severe CSU
with marked pruritus and more than 50 hives/day or large
confluent areas of hives), while intermediate values (1-6,
7-15, and 16-27) were classified as well-controlled, mild, and

moderate CSU, respectively, as previously described.®'*

Post-treatment values of UAS7 were also used for the
evaluation of treatment response; patients with UAS7 < 6
were classified with well-controlled disease, while those with
UAS7 = 0 as complete responders, according to previous
recommendations.®:'* Patients with complete control or wellcontrolled disease were classified as responders. Treatment
response was classified as early when noted within the first
month of treatment and late when noted after a time period
of 3 months, as previously proposed.'® Responses noted
within the remaining timeframe - second to third month of
treatment - were classified as intermediate. The timing of
treatment response (early/intermediate versus late) was
correlated with the demographic, clinical, and laboratory
parameters of patients.

Statistical analysis

Continuous variables are presented with mean and standard
deviation (SD). Quantitative variables are presented with
absolute and relative frequencies. Fisher's exact tests were
used for the comparison of categorical variables between
those with early/intermediate and those with late treatment
response. Student’s ttests were computed for the
comparison of continuous data between the two
aforementioned groups of patients. All P values reported are
two-tailed. Statistical significance was set at 0.05, and
analyses were conducted using SPSS statistical software
(version 19.0).

Results

Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data

The study population comprised 20 patients with refractory
CSU, among a total of 94 cases of CSU diagnosed and treated
in our department during the same time period (January 2014
to December 2016). The demographic, clinical, and laboratory
data of all studied cases are summarized in Table 1. Mean age
of our patient population was 54.5 years (range 19-85 years),
while the majority were females (15/20 cases, 75%). Angioedema was present in 10/20 cases (50%). Mean disease duration prior to omalizumab administration was 21.8 months (range
3-60 months). A history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis was recorded
in five cases and diabetes in two cases, while one patient each
had a history of hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, pemphigus
vulgaris, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), hypertension, or coronary artery disease, respectively.

ASST was performed in 15/20 patients (75%), with positive
results in 9/15 cases (60%). Serum levels of total IgE, ESR,
CRP, and TSH were elevated in 3/20 (15%), 14/20 (70%), 10/
20 (50%), and 0/12 cases (0.0%), respectively; TSH levels were
decreased in two patients (2/20, 10%). Positive ANA and
antithyroid antibodies were found in 8/20 (40%) and 6/20 cases
(30%), respectively.

Treatment response

Treatment data are presented in Table 2. Prior to omalizumab
administration, all patients had refractory CSU with persistent or
recurrent symptoms despite use of high-dose H1-antihistamines
and repeated courses of oral corticosteroids. Pre-omalizumab
UAS7 ranged from 11 to 42 (mean: 34). Post-omalizumab
UAS7, corresponding to the best response to omalizumab, was
zero (complete response) in 17/20 patients (85%), and six or
four (well-controlled disease) in the remaining 3/20 patients
(15%), after administration of one to five doses of omalizumab
(mean: 2.7). Overall, response to omalizumab after the first
omalizumab dose (“early”’ response) was noted in almost half
our studied cases (9/20 cases, 45%), after the second dose
(“intermediate” response) in 2/20 cases (10%), while the remaining patients responded after the fourth or fifth dose (“late”

response) (9/20 cases, 45%). Among all responders (20/20
patients, 100%), a direct response to omalizumab was observed
in 14/20 cases (70%), following the first or second omalizumab
dose in nine and two patients, respectively, and the fourth omalizumab dose in 3 patients. In the remaining cases (6/20, 30%),
the best response to omalizumab was achieved only after interval administration of a single 9-day course of methylprednisolone (total dose of 188 mg) (Table 3). Best response in
these refractory cases was observed after administration of five
or four doses of omalizumab in four and two cases, respectively.
The total number of omalizumab doses administered in all
patients ranged from 3 to 17 (mean: 10.8). Mean follow-up time
in all cases was 16.6 months (range: 3-26 months). At the last
follow-up, treatment was ongoing in 10/20 cases (50%). No severe adverse events were recorded during omalizumab

administration. There were no rebound symptoms in any of our
patients and only one case (case 4; 1/12, 8.3%) of recurrence
after discontinuation of omalizumab treatment.

As shown in Table 4, disease duration was significantly lower
in patients with late response as compared to those with early
response (P = 0.026). The remaining clinical, demographic, and
laboratory data were not found to be significantly associated
with timing of response to omalizumab (P > 0.05 in all cases).

Discussion

In the present cohort of patients with chronic refractory CSU,
omalizumab treatment was highly effective in achieving disease
control in all cases, with complete control in the overwhelming
majority of them. Best response to omalizumab was observed
after administration of the first omalizumab dose in 50% of our
studied cases, while delayed responses (after four of five doses
of omalizumab) were noted in the remaining patients. These
findings are well within the range of those reported by previous

International Journal of Dermatology 2018

investigators, suggesting that a_ significant percentage of
patients may respond to omalizumab within the first month of
treatment.°'''®'7 In the ASTERIA |, ASTERIA Il, and GLACIAL clinical trials,°-'' CSU was well-controlled after a single
dose of omalizumab 300 mg in 37%, 51%, and 37% of patients,
respectively, while in another two-center prospective case series by Sussman et al.,'° 44.1% of patients achieved complete
remission of CSU symptoms after the first dose of omalizumab
150 mg.

As further documented in the above studies, response to omalizumab may be dose-dependent, increasing with administration
of higher doses (300 mg vs. 150 and 75 mg), while continuous
dosing of omalizumab may also increase the percentage of
responders.° ''"'® Patients requiring more than 3-monthly doses
to respond have been described as late responders, and it has
been emphasized that discontinuation of omalizumab treatment
before administration of a minimum of three doses is contraindicated, as it may lead to suboptimal response rates.'® The exact
underlying these late responses

omalizumab was correlated with shorter disease duration before
initiation of omalizumab. We can only hypothesize that this potential correlation may be due to the presence of more active disease among patients with more recent onset of symptoms.
Evidently, given the lack of previous data, our small patient sample and the limitations pertaining to our study design (retrospective case series), these highly preliminary findings warrant
confirmation in larger prospective series.

According to previously published guidelines for the treatment
of CSU, a short-term course of corticosteroids (up to 10 days)
may be used when clinically needed for symptom control at any
treatment stage and particularly for severe disease exacerbations.” Although patients almost invariably respond to corticosteroids, protracted use of steroids is not advised due to the
well-known adverse side effect profile - such as hypertension,
osteoporosis, and rebound of symptoms upon withdrawal —
associated with their administration on a chronic basis.'® An
interesting clinical observation derived from our case series is
that a subset of patients who had initially failed to respond to
omalizumab achieved immediate and sustained responses after
a 9-day course of methylprednisolone, administered in-between
omalizumab injections, without discontinuation or alteration of
the initial omalizumab treatment protocol. Given the fact that
these patients had received repeated courses of corticosteroids
prior to omalizumab treatment with only temporary control of
symptoms, it is conceivable that the ultimate treatment effect
observed may have resulted from a combined effect of omalizumab and corticosteroids. Similar to our findings, a previous
research group reported successful use of short-term systemic
glycocorticoid therapy as a bridging intervention until administration of the next injection of omalizumab in real-world patients
with severe CSU." The potential synergy between steroids and
omalizumab might be an issue deserving further investigation.

In conclusion, the results of our single-institution case series
attest to the real-world safety and efficacy of omalizumab in
severe refractory CSU. A subset of our patient population, who
had initially failed to show an early response to omalizumab,
showed sustained response to the drug after administration of a
short-term interval of corticosteroids. Furthermore, shorter disease duration was correlated with late response to omalizumab.
Additional prospective cohorts of patients with severe refractory
CSU are warranted to confirm these findings and identify potential independent predictors of response and timing of response
to omalizumab.
