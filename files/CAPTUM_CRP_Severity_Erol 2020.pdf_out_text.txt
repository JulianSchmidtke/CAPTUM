Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria

Kemal Erol, MD°, Sule Ketenci Ertas, MD®, and Ragip Ertas, MD” Kayseri, Turkey

What is already known about this topic? Fatigue has not been studied in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) yet.

What does this article add to our knowledge? Fatigue, which is a trend topic in chronic inflammatory diseases, has
been studied for the first time in this study with CSU. It is shown that fatigue is common and predicted by female gender

and sleep disturbance in patients with CSU. Fatigue also contributes negatively to loss of quality of life and increases
burden of the disease in patients with CSU.

How does this study impact current management guidelines? Physicians who treat patients with CSU should talk
about fatigue with the patients especially females and/or patients with nocturnal pruritus at the management of CSU.

 

BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a common and disabling symptom
in chronic inflammatory diseases. To the best of our knowledge,
there are no studies evaluating fatigue thoroughly in patients
with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU).

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate fatigue and its drivers in patients
with CSU, and to compare patients with healthy controls in
terms of fatigue.

METHODS: One hundred and three patients with CSU and 35
age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects were evaluated
for fatigue with the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and visual
analog scale-fatigue. Patients were also assessed for their
duration, activity, and control of disease, as well as anxiety,
depression, and. quality of life (QoL).

RESULTS: There were no significant associations between
disease activity, disease control scores, and FSS (P > .05).
Although there were no significant differences in terms of
antinuclear antibody positivity and IgE levels between fatigued
and nonfatigued patients with CSU, C-reactive protein levels
were higher in fatigued patients (P = .009). A significant
correlation was noted. between total FSS score and both Chronic
Urticaria-QoL (r = 0.246, P = .013) and Dermatology Life
Quality Index (r = 0.302, P = .002) in patients with CSU. In
regression analyses, female gender and the presence of disturbed
sleep were found to be significant predictors of fatigue in

CONCLUSION: Fatigue is a common and important symptom
in patients with CSU and adversely affects QoL. While
evaluating patients with CSU, it is important to assess fatigue,
especially in female gender patients and in those having sleep

Key words: Chronic spontaneous urticaria; Fatigue; Quality

of life

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a chronic disease
characterized by wheals and pruritus and/or angioedema. '? CSU
is known as a female-predominant disease, and it causes reduced
quality of life (QoL) due to its considerable impact on daily life
and sleep quality of patients.”*° In addition, many patients
frequently suffer psychological problems such as depression,
anxiety, and other psychosomatic conditions during the disease.”

Fatigue is a common and disabling symptom in chronic, and/
or autoimmune, and/or allergic diseases including diabetes,
rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and so on, and
often ignored in daily practice.*'® The pathophysiology of
fatigue is not well understood but is thought to be multifactorial,
including abnormalities in neuromuscular, neurotransmitter
pathway dysfunction, and also concomitant with sleep disturbances and psychosocial disorders.'° Many studies have reported
sleep disturbances and psychosocial problems in patients with
CSU.''!? However, there are no studies evaluating fatigue in
patients with CSU.

Fatigue occurs more in females than males.'* In addition,
psychological conditions in patients with CSU including anxiety

 

and depression may cause fatigue.'* All of these may be
suggestive of a strong link between CSU and fatigue. Despite
this, real-life data about fatigue in CSU are lacking.

The aim of the study was to evaluate fatigue in patients with
CSU, to compare them with healthy controls, and to correlate it

patients with CSU.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study patients and study conduction

The study included 103 consecutive patients with CSU, who
were admitted to a tertiary hospital’s urticaria outpatient clinic, and
35 healthy volunteers, who were admitted to a tertiary hospital’s
routine health follow-up outpatient clinic, between December 2018
and February 2019. All patients had wheals with or without
angioedema.

This study was approved by the local ethics committee, and all
participants were informed about the study and given a written
informed consent form.

Characterization of patients and healthy controls

Patients were evaluated for their duration of disease, occurrence
of angioedema (coexisted or appeared during the course of CSU),
food and drug hypersensitivity, nocturnal pruritus with disturbed
sleep, and history of atopy. Atopy was determined by asking the
health history of the following diseases: atopic asthma, allergic
rhinitis/sinusitis, atopic conjunctivitis, and atopic dermatitis.
Patients’ comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and
thyroid disease were determined by a questionnaire and were
asked about during the first visit to the chronic urticaria outpatient
clinic.

Body mass index (BMI) (kg/m), number of children, history of

smoking, occupation, and educational statuses were also recorded.

Assessment of laboratory markers in patients with
CSU

Patients’ serum samples were analyzed for antinuclear antibodies
(ANAs) by immunofluorescence microscopy using HEp-2 slides
(EUROIMMUN, AG, Luebeck, Germany). The cutoff for ANA
positivity was set at an antibody titer of 1/100. Total IgE levels were
measured by quantitative analysis by the nephelometric method (BN
II System; Siemens, Munich, Germany). C-reactive protein (CRP)
levels were measured by using the tubulometric method. Serum antithyroid peroxidase was determined with chemiluminescent immunoassays (Beckman-Coulter, Woerden, the Netherlands).

Definition and assessment of clinical scores in
patients with CSU

Urticaria Activity Score (UAS) was used for the assessment of
disease severity and activity of CSU. The UAS shows wheal count
(points, 0-3) and itching severity (points, 0-3) based on the previous
day. The Urticaria Control Test (UCT) was used to assess disease
activity and disease control (0-16 points) and is composed of 4
questions with 5 answer options (0-4 points). Whereas low scores
indicate increased disease activity and reduced disease control, high
scores indicate a controlled disease.

Assessment of QoL in patients with CSU

The Turkish validated form of the Dermatology Life Quality
Index (DLQI), which consists of 10 questions and covers 6 domains
such as feelings, work, school, daily activities, leisure, personal
relationships, and treatment, was used for the evaluation of the
impact of skin diseases on QoL. A total score of 10 questions is

 

calculated in the DLQI. A score of 0 indicates no impairment of life
quality and 30 indicates maximum impairment. The Chronic
Urticaria-Quality of Life Questionnaire (CU-QoL), a validated
urticaria-specific questionnaire to assess the effect of CSU, consists of
23 questions, which measure 6 scales of QoL: “pruritus,” “swelling,”
“impact on life activities,” “sleep problems,” “limits,” and “looks,”
with high scores indicating maximum impairment.

Assessment of anxiety and depression in patients
with CSU

The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to
evaluate and measure the risk of depression and anxiety in patients and
control subjects. The HADS includes 2 separate scales with 14 questions; half of them assess anxiety and the others assess depression with 4
possible answers (score 0-3). Total HADS depression and anxiety
scores were accepted as 0 to 7 points = normal case, 8 to 10
points = borderline case, and 11 to 21 points = anxiety or depression.”

Assessment of fatigue in patients with CSU

The Turkish validated Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is a short and
easy-to-understand patient-reported outcome measurement with 9
items with each ranging from 1 (indicates strong disagreement) to 7
points (indicates strong agreement) and was used to assess the
severity of fatigue in different situations during the past week.'° The
final score was found by calculating the mean value of the total 9
items. FSS final score >4 was interpreted as fatigue.’ “Tt is a useful
scale for both clinical situations and research.

Statistical analysis
arametric variables were shown as means and standard deviations
(SDs), and nonparametric variables were shown as medians and

 

interquartile ranges (IQRs). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used
to determine whether continuous variables were normally distributed.
The 1° test was used for categorical variables. The Student ¢-test was
used to assess 2 independent groups of parametric variables, and the
Mann-Whitney U-test was administered for nonparametric variables.
Independent predictors of patient outcome were determined by the

 

possible factors identified with univariate analyses and further entered
into the logistic regression analysis for multivariate analysis. HosmerLemeshow goodness of fit statistics were used to determine model fit.
P< .05 was used to infer statistical significance.

RESULTS
Patients with CSU and control subjects were similar in terms
of age, gender, BMI, number of children, occupational and

P < .001) scores in all participants (Table III).

Housewives and obese patients had more fatigue
than other patients with CSU did

When the patients with CSU were divided into 6 groups
according to their occupations, the highest value of FSS was
found in housewives (mean [SD]; 4.5 [1.79]), followed by
workers (mean [SD]; 3.6 [1.32]), retirees (mean [SD]; 3.5
[1.26]), professionals (mean [SD]; 3.4 [1.45]), unemployed
(mean [SD]; 2.7 [1.65]), and college students (mean [SD]; 1.9
[0.74]) (P = .002) (Table Il).

Morbidly obese patients had the highest FSS scores (mean
[SD]; 5.4 [2.28]), followed by obese (mean [SD]; 4.7 [1.79]) and
overweight patients (mean [SD]; 3.7 [1.50]). Patients with
normal BMI value (mean [SD]; 3.5 [1.74]) had the lowest FSS
scores (P = .019) (Table Il). Whereas FSS was weakly correlated
with waist circumference in patients with CSU (r = 0.213,

P = .035), controls did not have any correlation (r = —0.076,
P = .670) (Table IV).

Fatigue was not linked to disease activity, control
scores, and laboratory tests, except for CRP values

There were no significant associations between disease activity,
control scores (UAS, UCT), and FSS (P > .05). FSS scores were
not different in terms of ANA positivity, anti-thyroid peroxidase
positivity, and elevated/normal levels of IgE in patients with
CSU (P > .05). CRP values were lower in nonfatigued patients
with CSU (FSS < 4) (median [IQR]; 2 [0.9-3.45], mean [SD];
3.38 [4.46]) than in fatigued patients (FSS > 4) (median [IQR];
3.2 [2.0-6.15], mean [SD]; 5.95 [8.52]) (P = .009). CRP was
poorly correlated with FSS scores (r = 0.259, P = .008)
(Table HD).

Fatigue was linked to QoL scores in patients with
CSU

In patients with CSU, a poor correlation was noted between
total FSS score and both CU-QoL (7 = 0.246, P = .013) and
DLQI (7 = 0.302, P = .002) (Table III). In addition, a positive
weak correlation was found between FSS scores and 3 of the
subgroups of CU-QoL such as sleep problems (7 = 0.228,
P = .022), impact on life activities (r = 0.234, P = .018), and
limits (r = 0.272, P = .006) (Table IID).

Fatigue was predicted by female gender and
presence of disturbed sleep during the course of
CSU

Female patients with CSU showed more fatigue than males.
Among the patients with CSU, females had significantly higher
scores of FSS (mean [SD]; 4.2 [1.78]) than males (mean [SD];
3.4 [1.48]) (P = .025). Whereas 42 of 76 (55.3%) female
patients with CSU had fatigue, only 8 of 27 (29.6%) males had
fatigue (P = .022) (Figure 1, A).

analyzed to find any possible differences or predictors (Table IV).
Female gender and presence of disturbed sleep were found to be
significant predictors of fatigue in patients with CSU (P = .008;
odds ratio [OR]: 9.02; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.77-45.94
and P = .001; OR: 8.35; 95% CI: 2.33-29.95, respectively)

DISCUSSION

This study evaluated fatigue in CSU with details in a tertiary
center's patient population. Fatigue was more common in
patients with CSU than in the healthy subjects. Patients who had
more risk of anxiety and/or depression had more fatigue severity
and their QoL was lower. Other important findings of this study
were that female gender and sleep disturbance were predictors of
fatigue.

Increased circulated proinflammatory cytokines lead to fatigue
in chronical inflammatory diseases.'* Fatigue contributes negatively to loss of QoL and increases burden of the disease.”"'””°
With new generation medicines, which are used for chronic
inflammatory disease treatment, even though in most patients
disease activity may be suppressed, fatigue may not be
controlled.'* In Doong et al’s study,” systemic complaints
including headache or fatigue were evaluated in CSU and it was
reported that one-third of patients with CSU had headache or
fatigue, which was the second frequent systemic complaint. Patients who had systemic complaints had a higher burden of
disease.*' Sabroe et al’? reported that nearly three-fourths of
patients with CSU had headache, malaise, or lethargy in any
course of the disease. However, fatigue was not evaluated as a
separate parameter in either Doong’s or Sabroe’s study. There
was no study found that evaluates fatigue in CSU, which is a
chronic immune system—related disease. In the present study,
which assessed fatigue with the FSS, it was found that almost half
of the patients with CSU had fatigue and it was significantly
more than in the control group participants, whose age, gender,
and BMI were similar.

CSU is a mast cell—driven disease and has some pathogenetic
similarities to mastocytosis.~” Fatigue attracted attention in
mastocytosis when a case report was published about a patient
with a history of flushing, fatigue, and recurrent anaphylaxis,
who was diagnosed with mastocytosis.”* Then, severe fatigue
levels were reported in one case series that included 7 patients
and in one article including 28 patients with mastocytosis.”””°
In the last study, patients with mastocytosis had higher levels
of fatigue compared with healthy subjects. These results are
consistent with the level of increased fatigue we found in CSU,
another mast cell—driven disease. In a study that evaluated 733
patients with allergic asthma, where mast cells have a key role in
pathogenesis, 62.6% of patients had severe fatigue and it was
found to contribute negatively to disease-specific QoL.” All of
these studies suggest the potential role of mast cells in the
pathogenesis of fatigue, and further studies are needed to research
the relationship between mast cells and fatigue.

In other studies, fatigue was increased in patients with
psoriasis, and this increase was higher than in healthy control
group participants."*”? Skoie et al”” also evaluated fatigue with
the FSS in psoriatic patients, and they found that almost half of
the patients had fatigue, which is very similar to the present
study. As in the present study, their study also found that patients’ fatigue levels were significantly higher than the control
groups’. Compared with their study, the present study’s control
group had higher fatigue levels.°? In an FSS validation study, the
fatigue scores of the control group were similar to the FSS scores
of the present study’s control group.|” Moreover, in another
study, it was found that fatigue was higher in patients with atopic
dermatitis rather than for those without atopic dermatitis.”' The
present study with increased fatigue levels in CSU, which were

 
J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT
VOLUME Mf, NUMBER

shown for the first time, is a pioneering work to further studies,
which need to be performed on different types of fatigue, such as
motivational, physical, and cognitive fatigue, in patients
with CSU.

Sickness behavior, seen in chronic inflammatory diseases, is
related to fatigue, anxiety, depression-like symptoms, sleep
disorders, cognitive impairment, and pain hypersensitivity. The
disorders related to sickness behavior, as a result of neuroimmune
interactions, in which circulating proinflammatory cytokines take
part, come up as intertwined and which one triggers the other is
unknown.°* Geenen and Dures”’ searched literature to develop a
biopsychosocial model for fatigue in rheumatoid arthritis, and
they demonstrated that fatigue correlated with depression and
anxiety. It was shown that fatigue is strongly associated with
depression in psoriasis and both depression and anxiety in
systemic lupus erythematosus.°°** Thus, it was not surprising
that there were higher fatigue levels in patients with increased
risk of anxiety and depression in this study. In addition, there
was a closer relationship between the HADS scores and FSS
scores in control group participants than in patients with CSU.
This result suggests that reasons other than anxiety and/or
depression also contribute to fatigue in patients with CSU.

Obesity has been associated with increased fatigue scores in
the general population.” However, it is not possible to reach a
clear opinion because of limited studies in the relationship between obesity and fatigue in CSU.” In this first study evaluating
the relationship between fatigue and obesity, fatigue levels were
associated weakly with BMI and waist circumference in patients
with CSU, but not associated with BMI and waist circumference
in control group participants.

It was shown that most of the patients with chronic fatigue
syndrome did not work.*° It is known that employees with
fatigue are not efficient enough. “8 Even so, the data of
relationship between fatigue and occupational status were scarce.
Although there were no statistical differences in fatigue levels
between male and female gender in some studies,” there were
studies in which fatigue scores in females were higher than
males.°” Ina large Swedish population study, fatigue and sleep
disturbance were predicted by female gender. '* Our study found
that fatigue severity was higher in housewives. Female gender,
which we determined as a fatigue predictor, may have a relation
with this condition. We concluded that the higher fatigue levels
in housewives are associated with the fact that more women are
housewives, because of the sociocultural structure of our
region, rather than the tendency of those with fatigue not to
work.

There were no relationships between disease severity and
fatigue severity of the patients with CSU in our study. A study
that evaluated patients with asthma found that fatigue level was
higher in those who had uncontrolled asthma and/or severe
dyspnea.” This situation may be related to hypoxemia levels due
to dyspnea. However, hypoxic status is not expected in patients
with CSU. In a study that evaluated patients with psoriasis, Skoie
et al°’ did not find any relationship between fatigue and Psoriasis
Area and Severity Index scores. In inflammatory rheumatic
diseases, where fatigue is an important symptom, there are
fatigue evaluations in some disease activity indexes.“°*' However, in CSU, there is no fatigue evaluation in the UAS and
UCT, where disease activity and severity are evaluated. If this
study, which showed that fatigue is a serious and common
symptom in CSU, is supported by future multicenter and large

 

 

 

 

EROLETAL 7

studies, urticaria activity and/or severity indexes, in which fatigue
is also evaluated, may be developed.

In Skoie et al’s study, °° while a relationship between fatigue
and CRP values was not found in psoriatic patients, in the
present study, patients with CSU with fatigue had higher CRP
values than those without fatigue. It may be a reason for the
psoriasis study, where normal CRP values are expected in patients with psoriasis, if there is no musculoskeletal involvement.
However, elevated CRP values are common in patients with
CSU. In this study, a weak correlation was found between CRP
values and FSS scores. In this case, there may be a relationship
with proinflammatory cytokines and fatigue in CSU. However, it
should be noted that obesity is also associated with high levels of
CRP and fatigue.

It was shown that fatigue negatively affects disease-specific
QoL parameters in both asthmatic and psoriatic patients.”
Fatigue contributes badly to burden of disease. In our study,
we also showed that fatigue negatively affected patients’ QoL and
may cause a decrease in patients’ activities and may limit them.

Studies examining sleep disorder in CSU are scarce. It was
shown in a recent study that sleep is impaired in patients with
CSU.”? We found that fatigue was predicted by sleep disturbance
in patients with CSU. Because of altered sleep cycles related to
fatigue, '7!°? nocturnal pruritus, which leads to sleep disturbance, may be one of the reasons of fatigue in patients with CSU.
Another possible reason may be the sickness behavior of patients
with CSU. Fatigue and sleep disturbances are mutually associated
and both increase burden of disease. Therefore, when patients
with CSU are being evaluated, sleep disturbance should not be
overlooked.

The present study has a few limitations. This is a monocentric
study performed in a small number of patients, who were
admitted to a tertiary center. Some of the medications, such as
steroids and antihistamines, that patients take in the course of the
treatment may affect fatigue. These drugs were not defined in
how they affected the patient population. The strengths of this
study include that we assessed fatigue with a valid and reliable
tool such as the FSS and investigated laboratory and clinical
markers comprehensively. In addition, our results should be
complemented by future global multicenter studies, to obtain
stronger results.

In conclusion, fatigue is a serious problem, which occurs in
almost half of the patients with CSU and adversely affects QoL.
While evaluating patients with CSU, especially females and/or
patients with nocturnal pruritus, fatigue should not be
overlooked. Physicians should try to overcome this issue with a
multidisciplinary approach.
