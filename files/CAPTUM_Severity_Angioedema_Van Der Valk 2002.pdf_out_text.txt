Background Data on the natural history and prognostic variables of chronic urticaria and its
subtypes are scarce.

Method In order to inform our patients better about their prognosis we conducted an historical
cohort study of patients who visited a tertiary referral centre at a university hospital between 1968
and 1990. Of 950 patients who were seen in our clinic we could trace 544 patients by using
telephone directories, general practitioner records and population registers. These patients were
sent a questionnaire.

Results The response to the questionnaire was 68-4% (372 patients). Patients with severe disease
and longer lasting disease at the time of the first visit proved to have a worse prognosis than
patients with milder disease. The proportion cleared after 5 and 10 years was 29% and 44%,
respectively. Dermographism showed the best prognosis and cold urticaria the worst. Patients with
idiopathic urticaria without angioedema and the patients with angioedema did not differ significantly in prognosis.

Conclusions Although in this retrospective study patients with severe disease may have been more
inclined to respond, we may conclude that the study results indicate a very refractory course of
chronic urticaria in patients visiting a specialized dermatological unit. The study is not comparable
with studies in patients visiting a general practitioner or a dermatology unit in a general hospital,
but highlights the chronicity of the disease in this subgroup of patients with severe urticaria.

Urticaria is classified as acute or chronic on the basis of
its duration. Authors use periods of 1-6 months
duration to divide acute from chronic urticaria.'~?
Most recent textbooks define chronic urticaria as a
period of wealing lasting for more than 6 weeks.*"°
Chronic urticaria often remains unexplained especially if it is not associated with other symptoms. In up
to 50% of the cases one or more otherwise welltolerated physical stimuli can elicit an urticarial
response.'’ * These stimuli may account for all or part
of the symptoms. In the latter case the physical
urticaria is combined with chronic idiopathic urticaria.
The following main types can be discerned: urticaria

Quaranta et al.° found a mean duration of 4 years

authors’ office with chronic urticaria and/or angioedema. Champion et al.’ estimated that 50% of patients
with urticaria alone, angioedema alone and urticaria
with angioedema combined would have active disease
for 6 months, 1 year and 10 years, respectively. In the
latter study the patients were, however, not defined as
having acute or chronic disease. The author also noted

the very persistent course of cholinergic urticaria and
dermographism, although the number of patients was
small. In order to be able to inform patients with
persistent (physical) urticaria and/or angioedema better about their prognosis we conducted a retrospective
cohort study of patients who visited a referral centre at
a university hospital. This group of patients comprised a
selected group of patients with severe disease, which
was not comparable with patients visiting a general
practitioner or a dermatology unit in a general hospital.

Materials and methods

The study was done in a group of patients referred to a
specialized university clinic. At initial diagnosis, a
thorough history was taken from each patient; it
included concomitant symptoms and evidence of the
influence of physical factors. Routine blood tests were
done; additional blood tests were also done if considered
appropriate to exclude internal disease. We performed
tests on dermographism (modified after Grolnick), on
delayed pressure urticaria according to Warin and
modified after Ryan, on cold urticaria by local cooling
of the skin and on cholinergic urticaria by a bath test
exposing the lower part of the body to water with a
temperature of 42 °C.5!° Based on the history, physical examination and additional testing, 950 patients
were diagnosed between 1968 and 1990 with chronic
idiopathic urticaria and/or one or more types of
physical urticaria. We were able to trace 544 patients
from this group by using records of the national
telephone company, population registers and by
contacting the patients’ general practitioners. These
patients were sent a questionnaire addressing prognos
Table 1. Demographic data

tic factors on the course of the disease: age at start of
symptoms, duration of disease before and after diagnosis, race, education, smoking habits, comorbidity,
including internal disease, focal infections and atopy,
working conditions, familial occurrence, severity, subtype and emotional stress. The severity of the urticaria
was calculated on the basis of lesion duration, the
number of lesions, number of separate episodes, average size of lesions and pruritus according to Breneman
et al.!' Each variable was rated from 0 to 3 points,
making a maximum score of 15.

We used a Kaplan-Meier analysis to determine as a
function of time the proportion completely cleared for
the total group and seven subgroups (see Table 1).!?
Using a proportional hazards model, which estimates the
prognostic value of a characteristic while taking the
prognostic value of other characteristics into account,
we studied the influence of possibly relevant variables on
the proportion cleared.'* We chose chronic idiopathic
urticaria with or without angioedema as the reference
group and estimated the proportion of the other
subgroups who cleared in relation to this reference. In
order to assess the influence of the subtypes on prognosis, groups were formed from the total group with
chronic idiopathic urticaria with or without idiopathic
angioedema, and delayed pressure urticaria with or
without chronic idiopathic urticaria, symptomatic
dermographism, cold contact urticaria, cholinergic
urticaria and angioedema. The patients with idiopathic
urticaria without angioedema and the patients with
angioedema did not differ significantly in prognosis and
were therefore combined for the analysis. Patients with
other less frequent subtypes or infrequent combinations
of subtypes were excluded from this calculation.

Results

The response to the questionnaire was 68-4% (372 of
544 patients traced). The demographic data of the
respondents are presented in Table 1. The mean age at
the time of diagnosis was 34-8 years and the duration
of symptoms at that time was 4:9 years; 40% of the
patients were male. The group of respondents did not
differ from the total group with respect to age at the
start of symptoms, race, gender and distribution of
subtypes of urticaria.

The cumulative proportion of patients whose urticaria cleared completely is plotted as a function of time
(Kaplan-Meier analysis) in Figure 1. The time of
diagnosis was taken as the start of the analysis. The
proportion of the total group and the subgroups whose
urticaria completely cleared is presented in Table 2.
The proportion cleared of all patients taken together
after 5 and 10 years was 29% and 44%, respectively.
Dermographism showed the best prognosis and cold
urticaria the worst.

Duration of disease at first visit, severity of disease,
subtype and familial occurrence proved to be factors
significantly influencing the prognosis. Race, education, smoking, habits, comorbidity, including internal
disease, focal infections, atopy and working conditions
did not influence the prognosis. Table 3 shows the
relative proportion of the subtypes that cleared in
relation to the reference group, severity (per unit
change), duration (per year), atopic vs. non-atopic past
or present history and familial occurrence vs. nonfamilial occurrence.

Discussion

This study describes the natural history of a cohort of
well classified patients with urticaria. Although in
this retrospective study not all patients could be
traced and only 68-4% of the patients responded to
the questionnaire, which may have resulted in a
somewhat overestimated duration if patients with
severe disease are more inclined to respond; therefore, we may conclude that the study results indicate
a very refractory course of chronic urticaria in the
selected group of patients visiting a specialized
dermatological unit. All major types of urticaria were
seen, although we discerned differences. Cold urticaria and the group of less frequent combinations of
physical urticaria and rare types of physical urticaria
have a worse prognosis. The results of the total
group are in contrast with other studies showing a
more favourable prognosis (earlier studies did not
invariably discriminate between the types of urticaria).°"7"1*15 The age at onset of symptoms and the
sex ratio of the total group and the types are in
agreement with other studies.°!°

The severity and duration of disease at the first visit
proved to be important prognostic factors. These factors
may account for the differences in prognosis as observed
in this study compared with the results in other studies.
The patients in our study may have been more severely
affected and may have had longer lasting disease at first
visit compared with those in the studies of Quaranta
et al.° and Champion et al.’ because the patients we

studied had been referred to a supra-regional referral
centre. The population we studied cannot be compared
with patients visiting a general dermatologist, in whom
the prognosis will be much better. On the other hand it is
feasible that patients with milder physical urticaria may
change their life-styles and/or get used to mild symptoms and consequently consider their disease in remission, although if these patients are challenged with
appropriate physical stimuli, weals can be elicited.
Patient reports may therefore underestimate the duration of disease in mild physical urticaria.

A representative sample of chronic urticaria as
discussed by Quaranta et al.° can only be defined on
the basis of data on the severity and duration of disease;
this is because study results on the natural history of
chronic urticaria will always be influenced by the
make-up of the study population. Patients with severe
disease and longer lasting disease have a worse
prognosis compared with patients with milder disease.
Therefore, results of studies on prognosis and/or on
treatment results should be accompanied by data on
severity and duration.
