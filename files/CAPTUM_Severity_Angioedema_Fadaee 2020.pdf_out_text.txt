ABSTRACT

Substance P (SP) is a neurotransmitter emitted from neurons that plays a role in the
pathogenesis of itching conditions including chronic urticarial (CU). The present research
aims to investigate the serum level of S.P among CU patients and compare them with
healthy subjects and explore how it correlates with the severity of urticaria.

The present research was conducted on 87 CU patients who visited the allergy clinic of
Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad, Iran from October 2017 to June 2018. Besides, 86 healthy
subjects were recruited as the control group. Background information of patient was
collected including age, sex, duration of the disease and the co-occurrence of angioedema.
S.P serum level was measured in two groups by ELISA method. In the patients group, the
autologous serum skin test (ASST) was performed along with the urticaria evaluation
questionnaire include Urticaria Activity Score 7 (UAS7), Urticaria Control Test (UCT) and
Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life (CU-Q2OL).

Among the patients, the SP serum level showed to be about two times higher than the
healthy subjects (6<0.001). SP showed to be increased as patients’ age grew (p=0.010). In
patients with a positive ASST, SP level was higher (=0.012). No correlation was found
between SP and the presence of angioedema among patients. There was no correlation
between the SP serum level and the scores obtained from urticaria evaluation questionnaires.

SP among CU patients was higher than healthy subjects. SP was also higher among
female, older and positive ASST patients. The SP value was not correlated with the severity
of urticaria, angioedema. In conclusion, Using SP antagonist drugs could be a potential
treatment for chronic urticaria.

Serum Evaluation of Substance P in a Study on Chronic Urticaria

INTRODUCTION

Urticariais characterized by the appearance of
pruritic, erythematous papules or plaques, with
superficial swelling of the dermis. More than twenty
percent of ordinary people in society experience hives
at least once in their lives.'If urticaria remains on the
skin most of the weekdays and for a length of at least
six weeks, it is called chronic urticaria (CU).’°CU
usually afflicts more than one percent of the population
and in eighty percent, the cause is not known. Though
CU is not a fatal disease, it tremendously affects the
quality of life. Controlling the clinical symptoms of CU
is also costly.” Drugs such as antihistamines and
corticosteroids often reduce the symptoms temporarily.
Yet, in the long run, they can have certain adverse
effects. Moreover, they do not work on all patients.’
Investigation of CU patients has shown that the
presence of angioedema, more severe urticaria,
positive autologous serum skin test (ASST) are
correlated with a longer duration of the illness.’ The
above-mentioned issues attest to the significance of
the disease and recognition of the mechanisms involved
so as to develop new and more efficient medical
therapies.

As for the pathogenesis of CU, there have been
numerous theories. Yet, none have been proven on an
absolute basis. Though the majority of the related
literature has looked into the autoimmunity theory,
there are several investigations of mastocyte
abnormalities of skin cells and basophils.*° A variety of
reasons can lie behind the degranulation of mastocytes
leading to the emergence of urticaria and itching.”* In
an investigation, such neurotransmitters as SP showed
to be involved in the degranulation of mastocytes and
production of chemokines.’ In some other research, SP
was found to be the most prevalent neurotransmitter
released after a local trauma to the skin leading to the
emergence of wheal and flare at the traumatic site.'°
Substance P (SP) is a neuropeptide (neurotransmitter)
with 11 amino acids which belongs to a family of
peptides known as tachykinins. SP is released from
certain neurons and belongs to the non-adrenergic noncholinergic category (NANC). Once released, it is
capable of activating some other inflammatory factors.
It poses its effect through an axon reflex.'' SP is widely
spread in the peripheral nervous system. It is not only
present in neural tissues but also in such other tissues as
skin.’ It from neurons or inflammatory cells such as

Vol. 19, No. 1, February 2020

macrophage, eosinophil, lymphocytes, and dendritic
cells. It acts through binding to Neurokinin-1 receptor
(NK1R) which is the main receptor.'*""*

A body of research on patients afflicted with
chronic itchy skin diseases such as psoriasis showed
that the rate of free plasma SP and its tissue as well as
NKIR in patients suffering from itching is significantly
higher than those without this problem. Moreover, an
increase in the free plasma SP is closely related to the
higher severity of such clinical symptoms as itchy
skin. Thus, these researchers suggested that probably
SP and NKIR play a role in the pathophysiology of
chronic itchy skin diseases such as Psoriasis.'° In a
body of research on chronic urticaria, first, no
statistically significant difference was found between
the SP level of those afflicted with CU and the control
group.'® Newer investigations, however, reported the
SP level many times as high.'”'° In some research, the
level of SP showed to the with the severity of the
disease.'’ In another investigation, overregulation the in
the NK1 receptor in eosinophil of CU patients. Besides,
the rate of SP was higher than the normal control
group.”

Aprepitant drug, which is an antagonist of the NK1
receptor (SP receptor), is applied in the treatment of
chemotherapy-resistant vomiting and its efficiency
have been investigated.”' It has shown to be effective in
treating chronic itching and CU resistant to therapy.””””
If the correlation of SP and CU is proven and SP is
targeted, its main receptor ie. NK1 can be a new
treatment for skin diseases that involve chronic itching
including CU.

Due to the different result of studies, we design this
project to evaluate the role of SP in CU.

 

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Data Collection

In the present research, two cross-sectional studies
were conducted on 87 CU patients visiting the allergy
clinic of Ghaem Hospital in Mashhad, Iran from
October 2017 to June 2018. Full consent was obtained
from the participant. Those included were patients
diagnosed with CU by an allergist. Those with physical
urticaria, those with systemic diseases and those with
depression and anxiety were excluded.

So as to compare SP between patients and healthy
population, a control group was used with 86 healthy
subjects matched with the patient group in terms of age

J. Fadaee, et al.

and sex, willing to take part in the study. The healthy
have exclusion criteria like patients.

Questionnaire Completion

87 CU patients filled out a checklist to record
demographic information such as age, gender, and
duration of the disease.

In order to evaluate the effect of urticaria on their
quality of life, the Persian version of (CU-Q2oL)
(Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life) was used in this
research.* Completion of this questionnaire was
followed by the Urticaria Activity Score7(UAS-7)
questionnaire.” The same physician completed the
UAS-7 questionnaire for all patients.

The Urticaria Control Test (UCT) questionnaire
was used to rate the extent to which urticaria was
controlled in patients.*°

Sampling Procedure and Conducting ASST

Once the participants consented to undergo ASST,
5 ce blood sample was taken under sterilized
conditions. The samples were then stored at room
temperature for 30 minutes and when fully coagulated,
they were segregated in a centrifuge device.A (31gauge) syringe was used to inject .05 cc of patient’s
serum, histamine (10 g/mL) and normal saline (0.9%)
as a positive and negative control to the front side of
the forearm in a distance of 3-5 centimeters
intradermal. Within 30 minutes of the test, the injection
site was read. The negative control was supposed to be
asymptomatic while the positive control was expected
to be swollen with a red rash in the surroundings.
ASST result would be taken as positive only when the
injection site was 1.5 mm more swollen than the
negative control site.*' The remaining blood serum was
segregated and stored at -80 degrees centigrade until
the test time. Then the S.P level was measured through

EIISA kit (Made in Zell Bio GmbH, Germany, Cat No:
ZB-11528C-H9648).

Ethical Considerations

Informed consent to take part in the research was
obtained from the subjects. This research was approved
by the Ethics Committee of Mashhad University of
Medical Sciences (N. IR.MUMS.fm.REC.1396.610).

Statistical Analysis

The normality of data was checked through the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. To compare normallydistributed variables in the two research groups, T-test
was used and for compare abnormally distributed data,
Mann-Whitney U-test was used for both groups. To
compare quantitative variables across different age
groups in terms of the type of distribution, ANOVA or
Kruskal-Wallis were used.

Pearson or Spearman Correlation test was used to
check whether there was a correlation between the
variables. p-value was set at<05 to check the
significance of findings. IBM SPSS, version 23 (IBM
Corp., Armonk, N.Y., USA) was used to do all the
analyses.

RESULTS

Participants’ Demographic Information

From 87 patients, 57 were female and 30 were
male. There were 86 healthy subject participants, 56 of
them were female and 30 were male. The age
difference between the two groups was checked with
Mann-Whitney U-test and the results showed that it is
insignificant (p=0.926). The gender difference between
the two groups was checked through the Chi-squared
test and the results showed that it was not significant
(p=0.956) (Table 1).

SP Serum Level in Patients vs. Healthy Participants

The mean SP serum level of the patient group
was 434.37+227.917pg./mLwhich was about twice as
high as that of the healthy (238.214116.980pg./mL).
Mann-Whitney U-test showed a statistically significant
difference between the two research groups with
this respect (p<0.001). Figure 1 indicates the SP serum
level of all participants of both research groups.

SP Serum Level Compared in Terms of Patients’
Gender

In Group A (patients), the mean SP level of male
participants was 400.13+184.954 and the mean of female
participants was 452.394247.188. In group A, the
difference between male and female was not statistically
significant (p=0.312). In group B (control), the SP level
of the male was estimated at 268.23+172.98 and that of
the female group was 222.13+67.94 (Figure 2). In the
control group, the two sexes showed no statistically
significant divergence (p=0.136).

SP Serum Level Compared in Terms of Age
Pearson correlation test was run for all participants

(n=173) which showed a. statistically significant
correlation between SP value and increase of age
(p=0.010, r=0.197). In Group A (patients), the
Spearman test was run which similarly showed a
statistically significant correlation between increasing
age and SP value (p=0.004, r=0.307) (Table 2).

SP Serum Level Compared in Terms of Patients’
ASST

Among 87 CU patients, 53 (61%) and 34 (39%) had
respectively positive and negative test result. Among
the former, the mean SP was significantly higher than
the latter (p=.0012) (Table 2). In terms of ASST size,
among 53 CU patients with a positive ASST result, the
mean diameter was 7.21+2.332 mm (min=3, max=13
mm).

SP Serum Level Compared in Terms of patients’
Angioedema

In group A (patients), 41.4% had angioedema while
58.6% had none. There was no statistically significant
difference between those with angioedema and those
without (p=0.872) (Table 2).

SP Serum Level Compared in Terms of the
Duration of Disease

The mean duration of CU was 36.85+56.981
months. No statistically significant correlation was
found between the SP level and duration of the disease
(p=0.57, r=-0.062).

SP Serum Level Compared in Terms of CU Severity
Measured in Questionnaires

Spearman correlation test was then run and found
no statistically significant correlation between higher
SP level and higher CU-Q2oL score (p=0.631),higher
UAS7 score(p=0.898) and lower UCT score (p=0.092)
(Table 3).

ASST Result Compared with Urticaria
Questionnaire Results

To compare urticaria evaluation questionnaires as
subjective measures and ASST result as an objective
instrument of testing urticaria severity, positive and
negative ASST subjects were compared that all results

are showed in Table 4.

ASST Size (mm) Compared with Questionnaire
Results

In the positive ASST group, the test size in
millimeter was compared to the questionnaire results.
Statistically significant correlations were found
between UAS7 and Pruritus (p=0.042, r=0.280) in one
hand and CU-Q2oL and Pruritus on the other (p=0.032,
1=0.295).

DISCUSSION

According to our knowledge, central histamine
mediator often causes itching in CU patients. It is
primarily released from the degranulation of
mastocytes and basophils.’ Neurotransmitters such an
SP, through degranulation of mastocytes and basophils,
can cause itching and hives in people.” The present
research aimed to explore the role of SP in CU patients
and the results indicated a higher level (twofold) of SP
in CU patients in comparison with the healthy group.

In previous researches, only 4 other investigations
explored the SP serum level in CU patients. Basak et
al. had 57 CU patients along with 47 healthy subjects
matched in terms of age and gender. They found a
twofold increase in the CU patient group which was
similar to the present finding.'* In another study, Metz
et al. studied 118 CU patients compared with 30
healthy subjects. Similar to the present study, the SP
level was higher in the CU group than the healthy (4
times as higher).'’ In another research, Zheng et al
reported a higher SP level in their CU group as
compared to the control (3 times as higher).'” The only
research which observed no difference between the SP

 

Vol. 19, No. 1, February 2020

level of the CU group and that of the healthy was
conducted by Tedeschi et al with 117 patient subjects
and 24 healthy individuals. They found no significant
difference between these two groups.'° What was
common between our research finding and that the
research by Basak, Metz, and Zheng was the higher SP
level in CU patients in comparison to healthy people.
Contrary to the present research and others, the study
by Tedeschi et al reported no statistically significant
difference between the two groups. However, it is
noteworthy that the experimental kits used in the newer
researches including our study have been more
sensitive.

In case the serum is segregated from blood after an
hour or the cold chain is not stored in a freezer at the
temperature of -80 degrees, the SP level is decreased.
One advantage of the present research over others is the
large health sample size (n=86) as compared to that of
Tedeschi (n=24), Zheng (n=15) and Basak (n=46). This
provided a more precise comparison of the healthy and
patient groups.'*'? Moreover, in the present research,
those with psychological disorders, anxiety or major
depression were excluded from both groups; those with
a physical disease other than CU which might have

J. Fadaee, et al.

induced an increase in SP level. Two research groups
were matched in terms of age and gender. In the patient
group, the SP showed to be higher among female
participants and SP increase with the increase of age. In
other investigations, SP level was not compared in
terms of age or gender. As SP has been recognized as a
factor involved in the severity of CU** and positive
ASST result is also considered a factor underlying the
severity of CU and duration of disease,” SP levels were
compared in the two ASST result groups (positive and
negative). The former group showed a significant
higher SP level than the latter one. In Tedeschi’s
investigation, 3 patients were positive ASST and
marked as high SP level.'® In Basak’s research which
looked into the correlation of ASST result and SP level,
two groups showed no _ statistically significant
divergence.'* Mind that the number of patient
participants in the present research was higher than that
Bask research.

Due to the fact that angioedema is also a factor
involved in the severity of CU,* the presence of
angioedema was also examined along with SP level.
The result showed no statistically significant difference
between those with and without angioedema in terms of
SP level. This finding was similar to that of Metz.'’
These groups were not compared in the related
literature. There is a need for further research into the
correlation of SP in CU patients and the prognostic
factors of disease duration and CU severity (e.g. ASST,
angioedema, duration of disease, etc.). SP level was
taken as objective data of CU severity and its
correlation was tested with the scores obtained from
questionnaires as subjective data to test the severity of
urticaria. No statistically significant correlation was
found between UAS7, UCT, and CU-Q2oL scores and
SP level. In the related literature, only Metz tested the
correlation of SP level and UAS7 score and found a
statistically significant correlation.'’ None of the
previous studies explored the correlation of S.P serum
level and duration of disease. In the present research,
however, the correlation between the two was tested
and showed to be insignificant. Thus, according to the
present findings, SP is not a prognostic factor of CU
severity and duration.

Another interesting point raised in the present
research but absent in the related literature was the
positive correlation between the questionnaire scores
and positive ASST result. Statistically,a significant
correlation was found between the pruritus domain of

 

24/ Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol

UAS7 and positive ASST result. So it is possible there
is a correlation between positivity of ASST and
severity of pruritus in chronic urticaria.

Similarly, statistically significant correlations were
found between the induced diameter of ASST and the
pruritus domain of UAS7 (p=0.042) and CU-Q2oL
(p=0.032). This would show that for those with more
itching (a higher pruritus score from UAS7 and CUQ2oL), ASST would turn positive at a larger diameter.

The limitations of our study were the lack of
evaluation of NK1 as a receptor of substance Pand the
small sample size. We suggest these performed in the
future studies.

In light of the present findings, the serum level of
SP in CU patients was twice as high as the healthy
individuals. SP level showed to increase along with an
increase in age. The serum level of SP was higher in
the 40 to 60-year-old group and among the female
gender. In patients with positive ASST result, SP level
was higher than the negative ASST group. SP value
showed no statistically significant correlation between
the severity and duration of urticaria, angioedema and
the evaluation scores of the disease.
