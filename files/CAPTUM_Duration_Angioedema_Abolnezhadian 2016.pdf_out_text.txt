ABSTRACT

Limited evidence has been obtained concerning the beneficial effects of autologous serum
therapy in treatment of skin disorders particularly chronic urticaria. In the present study, we
have assessed the effect of this treatment method in patients with chronic urticaria (CU).

This randomized single-blind controlled trial was performed on fifty consecutive patients
with chronic urticaria. The patients were randomly assigned to receive autologous serum (as
the case group, n=35) ot normal saline (as the control group, n=15) and treated with monthly
autologous serum therapy or normal saline for 6 months. The considered study endpoint was
changes in total severity score (ISS) at the 6 months follow-up visit. The TSS score was
assessed at baseline as well as at the ninth week and the sixth month of interventions.

The mean+SD of TSS at the ninth week of intervention was 10.9443.92 in autologous
serum therapy group and 11.67+2.72 in the normal saline group (6=0.458). Furthermore, the
mean values of TSS at the sixth month of treatment in the study groups were 8.29+6.29 and
9.27£4,89 respectively (6=0.593). A downward trend in TSS, from baseline to the end of
treatment, was seen in the case and control groups (6<0.001 for both), however the trend of
this decline was insignificant between the two groups (6=0.592). The change in the trend of
TSS after 6 months of treatment was independent from the administration of autologous

 

serum when compared with normal saline administration (beta=-0.962, p=0.630). Multivariate
linear regression model with the presence of baseline factors including gender, age, disease
duration and history of atopy was performed to assess difference in TSS at six-month followup visit compared with the baseline value. Only young age was associated with more reduction
of TSS (beta=0.163, p=0.023).

We found no difference in the effects of autologous serum therapy and normal saline on
the trend of the changes in disease severity in patients with chronic urticaria.

Effect of Autologous Serum Therapy in CU

INTRODUCTION

Chronic urticaria, is characterized by persistent
wheals or hives, and frequently originates from
degranulation of cutaneous mast cells leading to
extravasation of plasma in the dermis layer.’ This
clinical cutaneous disorder may have an idiopathic
pattern or may appear secondary to other underlying
conditions such as drug reactions, physical pressure,
sun exposure, fibromyalgia, reactive autoimmune
responses, arthropod bites or stings, some viral and
bacterial infections, psychological factors, or even food
allergy.>® Chronic urticaria is an irritating cutaneous
disease affecting daily living activities and quality of
life and carries heavy healthcare costs. Some studies
have been even analogized the disease load similar to
those with chronic cardiovascular disorders.’

A combination of antihistamines, anti-inflammatory
drugs, immuno-suppressants, monoclonal antibodies
directed to immunoglobulin E, antibiotics, and
antidepressants have been introduced as the main
treatment regimens for chronic urticarial.*'!° Along
with these medications, avoiding mental distresses,
identifying triggering risk factors, and using some
cutaneous lotions containing menthol and phenol can
be helpful to relieve symptoms of the disease, however
these treatment strategies are not definitive treatment
methods."

Autologous Serum Therapy (AST) has been
proposed as a treatment for a variety of diseases such as
allergic, inflammatory, infectious, and autoimmune
disorders.'* The main mechanism of AST is tolerisation
and desensitization of the affected patients to proinflammatory signals expressed in circulation system.'*
One of the main advantages of this therapeutic method
is related to its cost-effectiveness. Limited evidence has
been obtained concerning the beneficial effects of AST
in treatment of skin disorders particularly chronic
urticaria.'*'’ More trials are needed to confirm its
effect on symptoms’ relief in patients with chronic
urticaria. We aimed to assess the effect of AST
injection in patients with chronic urticaria.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
This randomized single-blind controlled trial was

performed on 50 consecutive patients with chronic
urticaria referred to the Allergy clinic of Shiraz

Vol. 15, No. 4, August 2016

University of Medical Sciences from January 2013 to
January 2014. This study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences
(CT-P-9367-6837). Moreover, written informed
consent was obtained from all participants.

The inclusion criteria were the presence of severe
chronic urticarial lasing for at least 6 weeks and most
days of the week and lack of response to treatment with
antihistamine. A history of serious systemic diseases,
positive food allergy skin test, urticarial vasculitis,
pregnancy or breast feeding, alcohol use, or using
immunosuppressive drugs were all considered as the
exclusion criteria. As initial assessment, all patients
underwent a variety of laboratory parameters’ testing
including blood cell count, tests of thyroid function,
liver function, anti-nuclear anti body (ANA), anti
thyro-proxidase (Anti TPO), anti-thyroglobulin, stool
exam, and urine analysis. If taking second-generation
antihistamines for five days or first-generation
antihistamines for two days, the patients were asked to
avoid using the drugs two days before the first visit.
Upon the initial visit, all patients were examined
physically and the results of laboratory analyses were
checked. Also, baseline characteristics and medical
history (including duration of disease, history of
physical urticaria, history of atopy, or presence of
angioedema) were recorded by interview.

Study Intervention

At first visit, serum was separated by centrifuging
the patients! blood at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes and 0.05
ml of autologous serum, 0.05 ml of normal saline as the
negative control and 10 pg/ml of histamine as the
positive control were injected intradermally at least 5
cm apart on the volar aspect of the left forearm. A 31gauge needle was used for injections. Sites of whealing
in the past 24 hours were avoided and the results were
read after 30 minutes.

Regardless of the autologous serum skin test
(ASST) condition, the patients were randomly assigned
to receive autologous serum (as the case group) or
normal saline (as the control group). For autologous
serum therapy, 6 ml blood was drawn, the serum was
separated and a 2.5 ml deep intramuscular injection
was given in the deltoid muscle. Rescue antihistamine
was permitted in the run-in period; no other drugs were
permitted. However, the patients were allowed to use
only cetirizine if necessary with a minimum and
maximum dose of 10 and 40 mg. The treatment was

continued weekly for 9 weeks and then monthly for 6
months. At baseline and at the end of the ninth week,
total severity score (TSS) was assessed. Then, the
patients were treated with monthly autologous serum
therapy or normal saline for 6 months and TSS was
reassessed. Rescue antihistamine was permitted as in
the run-in period; no other drugs were permitted. In
each visit, the patients asked for probable drug-induced
side effects. Six separate parameters of disease activity
and severity were recorded on a 0-3 scale at baseline (0
week), end of treatment (9 weeks) and follow-up (6
months). Based on these, a 0-18 TSS was generated
and overall disease severity was classified as clear
(TSS=0), mild (TSS=1-6), moderate (TSS=7-12) or
severe (TSS=13-18).'* ASST was considered positive
when the average of two perpendicular diameters of the
autologous serum wheal was >1.5 mm more than the
normal saline wheal. In this study, the considered study
endpoint was changes in TSS at the end of the 6-month
follow-up period.

Statistical Analysis

The multivariate linear regression analysis was used
to determine the effect of autologous serum injection
on severity of chronic urticaria with the presence of
baseline variables including gender, age, disease
duration and history of atopy. Trend of the changes in
TSS within 6 months of follow up was assessed using
ANOVA test on repeated measures. Mann-Whitney
and Chi-square tests were used as appropriated. Data
were analyzed using SPSS software, version 20. p<0.05
was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS

One of the patients, who received autologous
serum, discontinued and thus was excluded from the
study. Finally, 35 patients in case group and 15 patients
in control group were assessed (Figure 1). Baseline
characteristics of study patients are summarized in
Table 1. The mean+tSD of patients age was
34.80+13.15 and 37.87+10.58 years in the case and
control groups, respectively (p=0.429). Regarding
gender distribution, 11.4% and 40.0% of the patients in
case and control groups were men, respectively. The
mean + SD of disease duration was 3.60+3.50 and
4.5343.93 years in case and control groups,
respectively (p=0.442). A positive history of atopy in
the forms of asthma (14.3%), allergic rhinitis (17.1%),

330/ Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol, Summer 2016

and drug-induced allergy (2.9%) was present in the
case group. The corresponding figures were 6.7%,
6.7%, and 0.0%, respectively in the control group with
no difference across the two groups. History of
physical urticaria was 85.7% and 66.7%, respectively,
in the case and control groups (p=0.143), and the
presence of angioedema was observed in 77.1% and
93.3% of the patients in the case and control groups,
respectively (p=0.247).

Regarding baseline Para clinical examinations, liver

function test was normal in all subjects. All patients in
both groups had negative stool exam test. Abnormal
thyroid function test was seen only in one patient
receiving normal saline and abnormal urine exam test
was found only in a patient receiving autologous serum
treatment.
With respect to the results of TSS at different study
time points, the mean + SD baseline TSS in the case
group and normal saline group was 16.20 +1.49 and
16.00+1.19, respectively with no significant difference
between the two groups (p=0.648). All participants had
severe urticaria on admission with TSS ranging from
12 to 18. The meantSD TSS at the 9" week of
interventions was 10.94+3.92 in the case group and
11.6742.72 in the control group (p=0.458).
Furthermore, the mean+SD TSS at the sixth month of
treatment was 8.29+6.29 and 9.27+4.89, respectively
with no difference between the two groups (p=0.593).

A downward trend in TSS from baseline to the end
of treatment was seen in the case and control groups
(p<0.001 for both repeated-measure ANOVA test),
However, the trend of this fall was insignificant
between the two groups (p=0.592). The frequency of
mild, moderate and severe urticaria at ninth weeks was
11.4%, 57.1%, and 31.4% in the case group and 0.0%,
66.7%, and 33.3% in the control group, respectively
(p=0.390). Moreover, at 6 months, the signs of urticaria
were cleared in 25.7% of patients received autologous
serum and also in 13.3% of those who received normal
saline, while mild, moderate, and severe urticaria
remained observable in 11.4%, 34.3%, and 28.6% of
patients in the case group and in 6.7%, 46.7%, and
33.3% in the control group, respectively (p=0.689).

Considering difference in TSS at the 6 months
follow-up visit compared to baseline value and using
the multivariate linear regression model with the
presence of baseline factors including gender, age,
disease duration and history of atopy (Tablel), the
change in the trend of TSS after 6 months of treatment

was independent from the use of autologous
serum when compared to normal saline administration
(beta=-0.962, p=0.630). The trend of the changes in
TSS in case and control groups within 6 months of
follow-upwas determined and only young age was
associated with more reduction of TSS (beta=0.163,
p=0.023).

DISCUSSION

Increased level of circulatory autoantibodies such as
anti-IgE plays a major role in the onset of symptoms in
chronic urticaria. Systematic circulation of these
antibodies can induce release of histamine from mast
cells and basophils.'*?° 30-40% of patients with
chronic urticaria have histamine-releasing autoantibodies directed against the high-affinity IgE
receptor and approximately 27-61% of these patients
have these antibodies in their circulation.*"” The use of
auto-hemotherapy as injecting the patients’ own blood
and AST can be effective on ameliorating symptoms of
chronic urticaria. Consistent with previous trials, we
attempted to assess the effects of AST on the severity
of chronic urticaria. The patients were scheduled for
long-term treatment with autologous serum and then
followed to assess the trend of changes at three study
time points.

We found that patients receiving autologous serum
had a downward trend of TSS within 6 months of
follow-up. However, a similar trend was also observed
in the control group who had received normal saline.
On the other hand, no difference was found between
the therapeutic effects of autologous serum and normal
saline in decreasing disease severity. Although, at the
beginning of study, all patients suffered from severe
chronic urticaria, a notable number of patients in both
groups returned to a normal state without additional
treatment.

Considering the probable confounding effects of
some baseline factors such as sex, age, duration of
disease, and previous history of atopy, on therapeutic
effects of autologous serum, we adjusted our obtained
results for these underlying factors which turned out to
no differences between the two treatment methods
(autologous serum and normal saline) in relieving
symptoms of urticaria.

In a trial by Bajaj and colleagues,'* improved
symptoms of chronic urticaria were seen in 24.2% and
23.0% of patients with positive and negative ASST,

332/ Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol, Summer 2016

respectively. In a study by Staubach et al,”> AST
treatment led to improved disease symptoms and its
severity, as well as improved level of quality of life.
Majid et al'® showed that about two-third of patients
did not demonstrate any significant reduction in TSS at
the end of the treatment period. Debbarman et al,'°
showed more improvement in AST group when
compared with placebo group in TSS within 8 weeks of
follow-up.

In our observation, older patients experienced
delayed improvement in disease severity indicated by
falling TSS. Some studies could show higher rate of
atopy and also higher prevalence of acute dermatitis in
the elderly with chronic urticaria’. With the presence
of underlying risk profile and simultaneous
comorbidities in older patients, the trend of the disease
remission slows down.

One of the limitations of our study was that the
number of patients in the control group was less than
that of the case group which might have affected our
results. Another limitation was that our control group
received placebo which might affect the interpretation
of results since we did not have a group receiving a
routine treatment modality. Our study showed similar
downward trend of declining disease severity following
AST treatment method and normal _ saline
administration as the placebo, indicated by TSS.
