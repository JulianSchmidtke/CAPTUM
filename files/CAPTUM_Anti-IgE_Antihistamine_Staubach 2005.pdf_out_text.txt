Abstract

Background: Patients with chronic urticaria (CU) frequently exhibit positive skin test reactions to autologous
serum (ASST). Therapies aimed at inducing tolerance to
circulating histamine-releasing factors in ASST+ CU patients, e.g. by treatment with autologous whole blood
(AWB), have not yet been tested. Objective: To test
whether ASST+ CU patients can benefit from repeated
low-dose intramuscular injections of AWB. Methods: We
characterized CU severity and duration, anti-Fc,Rl and
anti-IgE expression, use of antihistamines, and quality of
life in 56 CU patients (ASST+: 35, ASST-: 21) and assessed the therapeutic effects of 8 weekly AWB injections in a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind,
parallel-group trial. Results: Numbers, size, intensity,
and/or duration of CU symptoms, quality of life, as well
as expression of anti-Fc,RI or anti-lgE were similar in

ASST+ and ASST- CU patients. However, CU in ASST+
patients was of longer duration and required markedly
more antihistaminic medication. Interestingly, ASST+
patients, but not ASST- patients, showed significantly
(1) reduced CU activity, (2) decreased use of antihistamines, and (3) improved quality of life after AWB treatment. Placebo treatment was ineffective in both groups,
but differences of AWB and placebo treatment responses
did not achieve statistical significance in either group,
most likely due to the limited number of patients treated.
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that ASST+ CU is clinically different from other CU subforms and that ASST+
CU patients can benefit from AWB therapy.

Introduction

Chronic urticaria (CU), acommon dermatosis characterized by spontaneously occurring short-lived and itching weal and flare type skin reactions, can be caused by a
large number and a variety of distinct conditions including intolerance to food or drugs as well as infectious and
autoimmune diseases [1, 2]. About 10 years ago, Hide et
al. [3] reported that the intracutaneous injection of serum,
a procedure also known as autologous serum skin test

(ASST), results in immediate hypersensitivity type skin
reactions in a subpopulation of CU patients. This observation has been confirmed by several other reports
showing that ASST-positive (ASST+) patients account
for 41-67% ofall CU patients [4-7]. Today, CU in ASST+
patients is widely regarded to represent a distinct subgroup of CU termed ‘autoimmune’ CU [8]. This notion
is supported by several independent lines of evidence:
(1) ASST+ CU patients have been shown to express autoantibodies directed against the high-affinity receptor
for IgE (anti-Fe,RI) or IgE (anti-IgE) [6]. (2) These circulating antibodies can release histamine from mast cells
and basophils [9], and injections of anti-Fc,RI IgG in
healthy volunteers cause urticarial reactions [8]. (3) Disease activity in ASST+ patients has been shown to decrease after plasmapheresis [10]. (4) ASST+ patients have
been reported to develop other autoimmune diseases
more often than ASST-negative (ASST-) CU patients
[11]. It remains unknown whether or not CU activity in
ASST+ CU patients can be decreased by tolerization, i.e.
by repeated treatment with the mast cell secretagogues
that are present in the sera of these CU patients [8].

As circulating histamine-releasing factors including
autoantibodies are responsible for the induction of urticarial symptoms in ASST+ CU patients [9], autohemotherapy, a historic form of CU treatment [12], may be
regarded as a promising specific and potentially curative
therapeutic option for this subgroup of CU patients. Autohemotherapy, i.e. repeated intramuscular, intravenous,
or oral applications of autologous whole blood (AWB)
sometimes treated with ozone or UV light, was commonly used to treat CU patients before the development and
introduction of antihistamines [12-14]. AWB injections,
which are also claimed to have therapeutic value in allergic diseases, circulatory disorders, viral diseases, and cancer [15,16], are still popular in central Europe, where they
are mostly performed in private clinics, even though there
is little evidence from rigorous clinical trials to suggest
that they are effective [17].

Speculating that ASST+ CU patients can benefit from
repeated low-dose applications of the circulating histamine-releasing factors responsible for their urticarial
symptoms, we conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind, parallel-group trial to test the efficacy of intramuscular injections of AWB. 35 ASST+ and
21 ASST- CU patients treated with weekly AWB or placebo injections for 8 weeks were examined for treatment
effects using CU severity, requirement of antihistaminic
rescue medication, and life quality as outcome measures.

 

Autohemotherapy in Chronic Urticaria

Subjects and Methods

Patients

Fifty-three of a total of 135 CU patients (= 6 weeks duration
of disease) subjected to skin tests with their own serum (see below)
exhibited positive ASST reactions. 35 (females: 26; age: 42.1 + 2.9
years) of these 53 ASST+ patients were compared with 21 ASSTCU patients (females: 15; age: 45.5 + 4.0 years) for differences in
clinical parameters and were then treated with repeated injections
of AWB or placebo. Each patient gave written informed consent.
Exclusion criteria were: CU due to predominantly physical causes,
pregnancy, lactation or risk of pregnancy without medically approved contraception, severe systemic diseases, as well as anticoagulation or systemic corticoid therapy. All patients underwent a
pretreatment evaluation consisting of clinical assessment including
routine blood screening for undetected systemic illnesses.

Autologous Serum Skin Test

Venous blood was taken and serum was obtained by centrifugation (5,000 g, 10 min, 21°C). Samples (100 ul) of autologous serum,
histamine (1 mg/ml, ALK-Scherax, Hamburg, Deutschland) and
human serum albumin (0.3 mg/ml, ALK-Scherax) were separately
injected intracutaneously (lower arm). Intervals of at least 5 cm
were left between injection sites, and areas known to have been
involved in spontaneous wealing during the last 24 h were avoided.
Short-acting antihistamines were withdrawn at least 2 days prior
to the skin tests. No subject had taken long-acting antihistamines
or immunosuppressants for at least 2 months before testing.

Weal and flare responses were measured at 30 min and the
ASST response was taken to be positive when the serum-induced
weal had a diameter at least 1.5 mm greater than the HSA-induced
weal [18].

 

Clinical Assessment

CU patients recorded expression of urticarial symptoms using
score values from 0 to 3 and the need for rescue medication (shortacting antihistamines required per day) every day for 1 week. The
weekly aggregate urticaria activity score (UAS), based on the UAS
used by O’Donnell et al. [9] and Grattan et al. [19], was calculated
for week 0 (before treatment), week 8 (immediately after end of
treatment) and week 12 (4 weeks after end of treatment). Briefly,
score values for ‘weal numbers’ (range: 0-3) and ‘pruritus intensity’
(range: 0-3) were added (range: 0-6) and the sums of all days of
week 0, 8 or 12 were totaled to obtain the weekly UAS (range: 0-42)
(table 1).

Construction of the Fc,RI-cDNA

Amplification and cloning procedures were performed as described previously [20]. Briefly, primers for polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were synthesized by Applied Biosystems (Foster City,
Calif., USA). The 622-bp Fce,RI cDNA (nt 107-718) encoding the
239 amino acid residues of the soluble extracellular fragment of the
a-chain of the high-affinity IgE receptor were generated by applying
PCR on acDNA derived from mast cells. Restriction sites for Bam
HI and Hind III were introduced by PCR using primer pair p183
gatcggatccatggctcctgccatggaatccce and p184F gatcgtcgaccggcttgacagcaatacttcttctccttc. The cDNA was ligated into linearized pQE30
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) resulting in the recombinant expression vector pQE-FCER. The presence of the correct insert was verified by DNA sequence analysis following the dideoxy method [21]

with the DNA sequence data retrieved from EMBL DNA data bank
(Cambridge, UK) using the most recent accession number
(X06948).

Quantification of Anti-Fc,RI and Anti-IgE Antibodies

Anti-Fe,RI antibodies were assessed by immunoblotting as previously described [20]. Briefly, recombinant Fc,RI was fractionated by 14% reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose.
Blots were blocked for 1 h in 1% (v/v) Tween-20 in PBS buffer
(154 mM NaCl, 20 mM KH>2POs, pH 7.6). For detection of autoantibodies, sera were diluted 100-fold in PBS. Monoclonal antibody directed to the N-terminal tag RGSH4 (Qiagen) was diluted
2,000-fold in PBS. After a 12-hour incubation at room temperature
with diluted sera, the blots were washed and incubated with rabbit
anti-human IgG or rabbit anti-mouse (Jackson Immunoresearch
Laboratories, West Grove, Pa., USA) conjugated with alkaline
phosphatase. The NBT/BCIP staining system was used as chromogenic substrate.

Analysis of Anti-IgE Antibodies

Anti-IgE antibodies were assessed by ELISA. Briefly, micro titer
plates (MaxiSorb™, Nunc) were coated by incubation overnight at
4°C with IgE (10 g/ml in PBS). Unbound protein was removed
by three times washing with PBS. Free binding sites were blocked
by incubation with PBS/0.5% Tween-20/0.5% bovine serum albumin/0.5% casein for 3 h at room temperature and plates were
washed three times with PBS. Next, patient sera were incubated in
a dilution of 1:50 in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature.
Rabbit anti-human IgG (H+L) (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was added in a dilution of 1:3,000 in blocking solution for | h at room temperature.
Freshly prepared OPD solution was used as the chromogenic substrate. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature in the dark,
the reaction was stopped by adding 100 wl 1 © sulfuric acid. Extinctions at 490 nm >0.2 were considered positive.

Study Design

A prospective, randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled
parallel group study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of AWB
injections in the treatment of ASST+ and ASST- CU patients. Approval of the Ethics Committee Arztekammer Rheinland-Pfalz was
obtained prior to the start of the trial and the study was performed
in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and German and European Good Clinical Practice Guidelines at the Urticaria Clinic
of the Department of Dermatology of the University of Mainz.

Stratification of Patients and Treatment

Hundred and thirty-five consecutive CU patients of the Urticaria Clinic Mainz were stratified (ASST+ vs. ASST-) based on the
presence or absence of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions
to intracutaneous injections of autologous serum. Seventy-nine patients failed to meet the inclusion criteria, did not provide written
consent, or were excluded from the study for other reasons (most
common reason: patients lived too far from treatment center). Consequently, 56 patients were enrolled in the study (fig. 1) and were
randomized into two parallel groups (ASST+: n = 35; ASST-: n =
21) receiving either repeated injections of AWB or placebo (sterile
saline). Randomization was performed by blocks of 10 using the
tanuni random number generator in SAS Software (SAS Institute,
Cary, N.C., USA). The treatment duration and method of administration were the same in both groups: (1) run-in-period of 1 week
to record baseline symptoms; (2) 8 weekly intramuscular gluteal
injections (alternating sides; blood was taken immediately before
teinjection from a cubital vein; blood was not subjected to anticoagulation or other treatment). This frequency/number of injections
and the volume of injections (1st injection: 2.5 ml, injection 2-8:
5 ml) were chosen after detailed consultation with practitioners
experienced in AWB therapy and because earlier reports from the
literature and initial pilot treatments performed had shown that
this regimen can be effective in the treatment of CU patients [22];
(3) 4 weeks of observation after discontinuation of treatment (follow-up). Patients were blinded to the treatment until after completion of the last study visit and handing in their diaries (week 12):
(1) by drawing blood before each injection (even in patients who
received placebo, where blood was taken but discarded), (2) by preparing sets of two identical non-see-through syringes (one filled with

nonautologous whole blood.

Outcome Measures

Outcome measures included (1) the improvement of urticarial
symptoms and (2) the requirement for antihistaminic rescue medication, which patients recorded daily for 12 weeks as described
above, i.e. comparisons of week 0 (before treatment) to week 8 (last
week of treatment) and week 12 (week 4 after termination of treatment), respectively. (3) Quality of life was assessed before as well
as 8 and 12 weeks after the initiation of treatment using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). DLQI, an instrument commonly used to measure disability in CU [23], isa 10-item questionnaire rating daily functioning on a four-point scale (very much, a
lot, a little, and not at all). Patients are asked to recall within the
past week symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and
school, personal relationships and treatment. The index is scored
from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 30 [24].

Statistical Analysis

All statistical analyses were primarily based on all randomized
patients (intent-to-treat population). As some patients in all treatment groups did not show any urticarial symptoms during the week
before they received the study medication for the first time, we defined a modified intention-to-treat-population, i.e. all patients who
showed symptoms during this baseline phase (defined by an average urticaria activity score of = 1). All analyses presented here are
based on data from this modified intention-to-treat-population, as
patients excluded from this group did not suffer from CU during
the baseline period and thus were unable to improve under treatment. However, analyses of the intention-to-treat population and
the modified intention-to-treat population did not differ significantly, i.e. intergroup differences in the improvement of AWB- and
saline-treated CU patients were not statistically different in these
populations. Missing values were imputed with the last observation
carried forward method. Between-group comparisons were performed using two-sided asymptotic Friedman tests or asymptotic
Cochrane-Mantel-Haenszel tests, each employing the ASST status

with CU

When we assessed CU activity in all ASST+ and
ASST- CU patients suitable for further analyses (n = 35
and 21, respectively; see Subjects and Methods section
and fig. 1), we found no significant differences between
ASST+ and ASST- CU patients comparing numbers,
size, intensity, and/or duration of urticarial symptoms
such as weals, erythemas, angioedema or pruritus (ta

ble 2). Nor did ASST+ and ASST- CU patients differ
with respect to total IgE levels or quality of life scores
(table 2). Notably, only 6 of 34 ASST+ CU patients were
found to exhibit antibodies against Fc,RI (vs. 4 of 21
ASST- CU patients) and only 2 of 34 ASST+ CU patients
showed anti-IgE (vs. 0 of 21 ASST- CU patients), confirming that such antibodies are not required for the induction of cutaneous immediate-type hypersensitivity
reactions to autologous serum (table 2).

In contrast, ASST+ CU patients were found to require
significantly more antihistaminic medication as compared to ASST- CU patients when instructed to only use
short-acting antihistamines in cases of severe bouts of
weal and flare type skin reactions (11.1 vs. 4.5 antihistamines/week; p = 0.02; table 2). ASST+ CU patients also
reported longer duration of CU (109 + 31 months) than

most likely due to the large variations of disease duration
in the limited number of patients studied.

Repeated Injections of Autologous Whole Blood

Significantly Reduce Disease Activity and Increase

Life Quality in ASST+ CU Patients, but Not in

ASST- CU Patients

On the basis of the modified intention-to-treat population (fig. 1), 9 of 13 ASST+ CU patients showed significant improvement of UAS after repeated injections of
AWB (week 0 vs. 12, improvement by >30%), calculated
from daily numbers of weals (0-3) and intensity of pruritus (0-3; VAS maximum: 42/week; fig. 2a). In contrast,
only 4 of 16 ASST+ CU patients that had received saline
injections exhibited significant UAS improvement after
treatment (fig. 2a). Interestingly, no differences in the percentage of responders were found comparing UAS improvements of ASST- CU patients that had received
AWB or placebo (5 of 9 in both treatment groups;
fig. 2a).

 

Autohemotherapy in Chronic Urticaria

Similar results were observed for other parameters of
treatment efficacy such as the reduction in the size or duration of weals or the improvement in size, numbers, and
duration of erythemas (fig. 2b-f). Most notably, in the
modified intention-to-treat population, all but 1 of 13
ASST+ CU patients treated with AWB reported improvement of quality of life (assessed by using the DLQI questionnaire) 8 and 12 weeks after the initiation of therapy,
whereas only 2 of 9 placebo-treated ASST+ CU patients
showed significant reductions (>30% improvement) of
DLQI scores (week 0 vs. weeks 8 or 12). On the other
hand, the percentage of ASST- CU patients that reported
improved quality of life scores was higher in the group
that had received placebo than in the active therapy
group.

When we assessed treatment groups for average
changes in disease activity, we found that ASST+ patients
showed markedly improved UAS after AWB therapy
(-41%, p < 0.05) as compared to UAS levels before therapy, whereas UAS did not improve significantly in ASST+
CU patients that had received placebo (—18%) or in
ASST- patients that had been treated with AWB (-21%)
or placebo (-11%; fig. 3a). ASST+ AWB-treated CU pa

tients also showed significant improvements of duration
and size of weals (-46%, p < 0.05 and -48%, p < 0.05,
respectively), whereas placebo-treated ASST+ CU patients as well as ASST- placebo- or AWB-treated CU patients only showed marginal and statistically not significant improvements (fig. 3b, c). In addition to these improvements of the leading CU symptoms weals and
pruritus, ASST+ CU patients also developed less erythemas, which were also of smaller size and shorter duration
after therapy with AWB (fig. 3d—f). In these patients,
numbers, size, and duration of erythemas were reduced
by up to 56% (p< 0.05), whereas placebo-treated ASST +
CU patients and placebo- or AWB-treated ASST- CU
patients only showed negligible reductions (<20%, p >
0.05) of these parameters (fig. 3d-f).

The quality of life in ASST+ AWB-treated CU patients
was markedly improved after therapy, i.e. by 70 and 66%
in weeks 8 (p < 0.005) and 12 (p < 0.05), respectively.
Also, drops in DLQI scores in ASST+ AWB-treated subjects (reflecting quality of life improvement) were significantly greater than in ASST+ placebo-treated CU patients (p < 0.05), where quality of life did not improve
significantly (by 20 and 28% in weeks 8 and 12; fig. 4a).
ASST- CU patients treated with AWB did not show increased improvement of life quality 8 or 12 weeks after
start of treatment as compared to placebo-treated ASST-—
CU patients (fig. 4a).

Interestingly, 12 weeks after the initiation of therapy
ASST+ patients treated with AWB required less than half
of the antihistaminic rescue medication they had taken
before therapy (-52%, p = 0.005). In contrast, usage of
antihistamines by ASST+ placebo-treated CU patients
and placebo- or AWB-treated ASST- patients improved
only slightly or not at all (fig. 4b).

As all placebo-treated study patients were offered open
trial AWB treatment after completion of the study, 9

injections were treated with AWB. Notably, 7 of the 9
ASST+ CU patients, but only 1 of the 7 ASST- patients,
reported improvement of CU activity after the completion of treatment. AWB injections were found to be well
tolerated and safe, i.e. none of the patients enrolled in the
placebo-controlled or open trial reported serious adverse
events due to the treatment. Minor adverse events resulting from study treatment were rare, transient, and equally frequent in all groups (mostly bruising and soreness at
the injection site).

 

Autohemotherapy in Chronic Urticaria

Discussion

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects
of AWB injections in ASST+ CU patients. Confirming
previous reports, about one third of CU patients (53 of
135, 39%) were found to exhibit positive ASST responses
[4, 25]. ASST+ patients did not show significant differences in the expression (duration, size, intensity, and/or
number) of urticarial symptoms including weals, pruritus, angioedema, and erythemas as compared to ASSTpatients. However, we found that ASST+ patients exhibit a longer, albeit not significantly longer, duration of disease and require markedly more antihistamines (about
2.5-fold) than ASST- patients, suggesting that ASST+
CU patients may be less responsive to routine antihistamine therapy [8]. Our data confirm observations by Nettis et al. [4], who also found similar expression of urticarial symptoms in ASST+ and ASST- CU patients. In
line with these results, CU in both ASST+ and ASST- patients had a negative impact on quality of life (determined
by the DLQI questionnaire), i.e. DLQI scores were greatly increased, but no significant differences were found
between the two groups.

The ASST is claimed to be a sensitive and specific test
for screening CU patients for the presence of anti-Fc,RI
[18] and previous reports have shown functional antiFc,RI to be present in ~40% of ASST+ CU patients and
in only <2% of ASST- CU patients [6]. However, we
found that less than 20% of ASST+ patients express antiFe, RI (anti-IgE: 6%). These differences may be explained
in part by differences in the sensitivities of the methods
employed to detect anti-Fc,RI, i.e. histamine release assays vs. immunoblotting. Nonetheless, our findings support the concept that positive cutaneous responses to autologous serum characterize a subgroup of patients suffering from ‘autoreactive’ rather than ‘autoimmune’ CU
as most ASST+ skin reactions were found to occur in CU
patients that did not express Fc,RI/IgE-targeting autoantibodies [26].

On the other hand, we detected anti-Fc,RI about as
often in sera of ASST- patients as in ASST+ patients.
Because mast cell activation by anti-Fc,RI from some CU
patients has been shown to be impaired when IgE is bound
to its high-affinity receptor [27, 28], we screened ASST+
and ASST- patients for total serum IgE levels. However,
we did not find significantly higher levels of IgE in ASSTpatients, which may have accounted for the lack of mast
cell degranulation in anti-Fe,RI+ ASST- CU patients after intracutaneous injection of their own serum. At this
point, we cannot explain why anti-Fc,RI is detected al

most exclusively in ASST+ CU patients by some groups
[6], whereas other studies, including ours, find both
ASST+ and ASST- CU patients and even healthy controls to express anti-Fc,RI [29]. Whether these discrepancies are caused by differences in patient populations or
due to the diversity of detection methods employed will
have to be determined in further studies (1) combining
functional tests (histamine release assays, ASST) and detection of anti-Fc,RI, (2) examining sound numbers of
CU patients, and (3) characterizing patients at multiple
treatment centers.

Independent of the likely heterogeneous identity of serum factors responsible for degranulating MC after intracutaneous injections in ASST+ patients, it appeared feasible to attempt to tolerize such CU patients to their respective circulating MC secretagogues. To test this, we
subjected ASST+ and ASST- CU patients to 8 weekly
intramuscular injections of their own blood and assessed
disease activity before and after treatment. The results of
this randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind, parallel-group trial provide direct evidence that urticarial
symptoms can be decreased by repeated challenge with
circulating histamine-releasing factors. Most notably, we
found that AWB injections significantly reduced CU activity by >40% in ASST+ CU patients and that 70% of all
ASST+ CU patients reported relevant improvement after
repeated AWB injections (vehicle treated: 25%). Therapeutic effects of AWB injections required the presence
of circulating histamine releasing factors, as only ASST+
patients, but not ASST- patients showed significantly
(1) reduced CU activity (weals, pruritus, and erythemas),
(2) decreased use of antihistaminic medication, and
(3) increased quality of life after AWB treatment. These
findings suggest that ASST+ CU patients can benefit from
asimple, inexpensive, effective, potentially curative, and
safe therapy with AWB injections.

Our findings encourage us to try and confirm the efficacy of AWB treatment in ASST+ CU patients in larger
and double-blind trials and to clarify two important questions that remain unanswered: (1) AWB-treated ASST+
CU patients, in whom all outcome measures improved
significantly, clearly exhibit responses different from
those of AWB-treated ASST- CU patients and placebotreated CU patients, in whom none of the outcome measures improved significantly. However, intergroup differences were not statistically significant for some of these
outcome measures including ‘disease activity’, most likely due to the limited numbers of patients per treatment
group. Thus, subsequent trials will have to assess greater
numbers of ASST+ CU patients, ideally at multiple treat

ment centers. (2) Our data suggest a sustained benefit of
AWB injections in ASST+ CU patients as score values for
virtually all outcome measures remained unchanged for
4 weeks after cessation of treatment or even showed further improvement. This suggests that the study period
may have been too short and that future trials should include follow-up assessments at later time points after the
end of treatment.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective randomized placebo-controlled study that assesses
therapeutic effects of AWB injections in CU patients. As
AWB injections induced significant improvement of CU
only in ASST+ patients, this traditional form of autohemotherapy may represent a means of inducing specific
tolerizing immune responses, similar to those seen in specific immunotherapy [30, 31]. While the precise underlying processes of therapeutic AWB effects remain to be
identified, possible mechanisms include the induction of
anti-idiotypes, which have recently been shown to inhibit the function of disease-inducing antibodies in pemphigus, another autoimmune dermatosis [32]. Alternatively,
AWB could skew CU Th2 cytokine patterns that promote
the induction of urticarial symptoms towards Thl, as
ASST+ CU patients, but not ASST- CU patients have
recently been reported to express significantly less IFNy
(Th1 cytokine) than normal controls [7].

Taken together, these data indicate that ASST+ CU,
i.e. autoreactive CU, exhibits a clinical profile different
from that of other subforms of CU, and ongoing studies
are aimed at better defining these differences. Our findings also indicate that ASST+ CU patients can benefit
from autohemotherapy and, therefore, call for further investigation of the effects and underlying mechanisms of
AWB injections in ASST+ CU patients.
