Objective Chronic idiopathic angioedema (CIA) is defined as three or more episodes of
angioedema in a period of > 6 months without a clear etiology. In the study, we tried to
explore clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with CIA unaccompanied by

Methods We retrospectively reviewed clinical and laboratory characteristics of 1238
patients with chronic urticaria and/or angioedema referred to our allergy clinic.

Results Eight hundred and forty-one (67.9%) subjects had chronic urticaria without
angioedema (CU Group), 323 (26.1%) had both urticaria and angioedema (CU + CA
group), and 74 (5.9%) had chronic angioedema without urticaria (CA). In 29 (39.2%) cases
of CA, no etiologic factor of angioedema was discovered, thus the patients were defined as
having chronic idiopathic angioedema (CIA Group). Twenty-two (75.8%) subjects had
antihistamine-responsive CIA and seven (24.1%) had antihistamine-unresponsive CIA.
There were no statistically significant differences in clinical (except of urticarial eruptions)
and laboratory characteristics between CU, CA + CU, and CIA groups. Antihistamine

responsive and antihistamine-unresponsive CIA groups had no distinguishable clinical or

Conclusions We suppose that CIA, at least its antihistamine-responsive form, represents
a rare form of chronic spontaneous urticaria. The reasons why in CIA there are no other
clinical signs of mast cell/basophil activation, such as pruritus, urticarial, and
dermatographism, are largely unknown and have to be elucidated in future studies.

Introduction

Angioedema is defined as a self-limited, localized swelling, which occurs in approximately 15% of the general
population." The most frequent syndrome of chronic
angioedema (CA) is chronic idiopathic angioedema (CIA),
which occurs in 38% of patients with CA, even after a
thorough clinical and laboratory evaluation.* Chronic
spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is associated with angioedema in about 30% of cases." However, in 10% cases,
angioedema occurs alone.* There is no consensus in the
definition of CIA. By some groups, episodes of angioedema persisting six weeks in duration are considered as
chronic,* while others defined CIA as three or more episodes of angioedema in a period of > 6 months without a
clear etiology.*

Chronic idiopathic angioedema appears to be antihistamine responsive in most cases, but in 14% of patients, it
has antihistamine-unresponsive features.* Antihistamineresponsive patients have probably mast-cell-mediated
angioedema, and non-responsives have probably bradykinin-mediated angioedema. Bradykinin is known to play a

major role in the pathophysiology of antihistamine unresponsive recurrent angioedema caused by hereditary or
acquired Cr-inhibitor deficiency or by treatment with
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.°°

Chronic idiopathic angioedema, not associated with
urticaria, is a diagnosis of exclusion after a patient’s thorough evaluation, but its real epidemiology and natural
history are largely unknown.’ In this study, we tried to
explore clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients
with CIA unaccompanied by urticaria.

Methods

The study was performed at our Allergy and Clinical
Immunology referral center in the Lakhish district of southern
Israel. The study protocol was approved by the local
Institutional Ethical Review Committee. We retrospectively
reviewed the electronic medical records of all outpatient allergy
consultations due to a diagnosis of CSU and CA from January
1, 2002, to March 31, 2012. CSU was defined as weals and/or
angioedema arising spontaneously, when the disease lasts

> 6 weeks. CA was defined as three or more episodes of

angioedema without urticaria in a period of > 6 months without
a clear etiology.°

In the study, we included all subjects > 18 years. As part of
the standard practice in our allergy clinic, all subjects had been
informed about any risks involved with testing, and written
informed consent for allergologic work-up (skin prick test,
autologous serum skin test [ASST]) had been obtained. Written
informed consent was given by control group participants.

Patients with other underlying etiologies of chronic urticaria
(urticarial vasculitis, physical urticaria, thyroid diseases,
systemic lupus erythematosus, food allergy, malignancy) and
angioedema (hereditary angioedema, acquired C1-inhibitor
deficiency, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-related
angioedema, food or drug allergy induced angioedema, other
causes of peripheral or generalized edema) were excluded.

The following data were collected from the computerized
database:

1 Demographic records, chest and sinus x-ray studies,

2 Results of ASST, if done,

3 Laboratory work-up results: liver and renal function tests,
complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, highsensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), thyroid function tests,
antinuclear, antithyroglobulin, and antiperoxidase antibodies,
C8, C4, serum protein electrophoresis, and IgE.

Clinical and laboratory evaluation and classification of chronic
urticaria and angioedema were performed according to the
EAACI/GA(2)LEN/EDF/WAO guidelines,® and the patients were
treated according to the current guidelines on the management
of urticaria.° Fexofenadine hydrochloride (Telfast; sanofiaventis, Netanya, Israel) 180 mg b.i.d. was used as the drug of
choice in the treatment of patients with CIA. The patients were
re-examined every 14 days to assess antihistamine treatment
efficacy.

Laboratory tests were performed before beginning treatment
with antihistamine medications, on the next day following the
first allergy consultation.

Autologous serum skin test

ASST was performed with 50 ul of the patient's undiluted serum
after allowing blood to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes
and sample blood centrifugation at 500 g for 10 minutes, which
was then injected intradermally into the volar aspect of the
forearm together with simultaneously injected controls, including
saline and 10 yg/ml histamine. The mean diameters of the
weals were measured at 30 minutes. A minimum difference of
1.5 mm in mean perpendicular weal diameter between the
autologous serum (AS)-induced response and the salineinduced response was used to define ASST positivity.

Complement tests

Serum was used for analyses of autoantibodies and for the
functional complement analyses. C3 and C4 component levels
were measured by the ABICAP assay (Biognosis, Jiilich,

International Journal of Dermatology 2014, 53, e421-e427

Eli et al.

Germany). The normal standardized values for each component
were 80-180 mg/dl for C3 and 10-40 mg/dl for C4. C1 esterase
inhibitor antigen level was measured by single radial
immunodiffusion (NOR-Partigen; Behringwerke A/G, Marburg,
Germany) and performed according to the manufacturer's
instructions (normal range 0.18-0.54 g/l). C1-inhibitor function
was assayed by functional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(Quidel, San Diego, CA, USA; normal range > 84%).

Other laboratory tests

Thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were
measured by a solid phase competitive analogue sequential
chemiluminescent immunoassay (Immulite 2000; DPC, Los
Angeles, CA, USA).

Blood levels of hs-CRP were measured by
immunonephelometry using BN systems (Dade Behring,
Marburg, Germany), and the reference interval for hs-CRP was
1-3 mg/l.

Antinuclear antibodies were determined by a commercially
available indirect immunofluorescence test kit (ANAFASTTM
kits; Diasarin, Stillwater, MN, USA) using HEp-2 cells as
substrate, and titers above 1/40 were considered positive.

Statistical analysis
Data with normal distribution were presented as
mean + standard deviation (mean + SD). Categorical data
were compared using the chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests
(two tailed). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and
Bonferroni post hoc examination were carried out for
comparisons between the four groups (CIA, CU + CA, CU, and
control) to evaluate whether statistically significant differences
exist among the groups. Level of significance P < 0.05 and with
Bonferroni adjustment was P < 0.0125. Antihistamineresponsive and antihistamine-unresponsive subgroups were
compared using Fisher's exact test (two tailed). Level of
significance was P < 0.05.

Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences version 16.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA).

Results

Demographic characteristics of the study groups are presented in Table 1. During the study period, 1238 patients
with chronic urticaria and/or angioedema lasting
> 6 weeks were referred to our allergy clinic. Eight hundred and forty-one (67.9%) patients had chronic urticaria
without angioedema (CU group), 323 (25.8%) had both
urticaria and angioedema (CU + CA), and 74 (5.9%) had
angioedema alone (CA). Among 74 patients with CA,
recurrences of angioedema were definitely related to exogenous stimuli in 45 (60.8%) cases, while no case of CA

triggered by food, infection, or physical stimuli was

identified (Table 2). In 29 (39.2%) cases of CA, no etiologic factor was discovered, thus the patients were defined
as having CIA. The control group consisted of 44 sex- and
age-matched healthy individuals recruited from the hospital and the primary care center staff. There were no statistically significant differences in most clinical characteristics
between the CU, CU + CA, and CIA groups. In the CIA
group, more patients with angioedema affecting the oropharynx (five, 17.3%) and genital regions (four, 13.4%)
were observed compared to the CU + CA group (four,
1.2%, P < 0.001; seven, 2.2%, P = 0.01, respectively).
From the laboratory characteristics, there was a statistically significant difference in CRP levels between the
CU+CA (2.62 + 1.39 mg/l) and CU (2.87 + 1.42;
P= 0.007) groups but not between other pairs of the
study groups. Basophils were lower in the CIA
CU+CA (0.03 + 0.09 cell/
mm), and CU (0.04 + 0.05 cell/mm}) groups, than in

the control group (0.19 + 0.14 cell/mm?; P < 0.001); but
no statistically significant difference in basophils was
observed between the CIA, CU + CA, and CU groups
(after Bonferroni correction) (Table 1).

Under antihistamine treatment, 22 (75.8%) CIA subjects were without angioedema attacks at week 8. These
patients were defined as having antihistamine-responsive
CA. Seven (24.2%) patients had at least one attack of
angioedema during the 8-week antihistamine treatment.
These subjects were considered as having antihistamineunresponsive CIA and were treated with daily tranexamic
acid (Hexakapron 500 mg; Teva Pharmaceutical, Petach
Tikva, Israel) 1 g tid. With tranexamic acid continuous
therapy, angioedema attacks disappeared completely in
five (71.4%) patients, and in two (28.6%) their frequency
and severity were significantly reduced.

All 29 patients in the CIA group reported a history of
recurrent angioedema involving different sites (mostly

or life-threatening angioedema attacks in both antihistamine-responsive and antihistamine-unresponsive CIA
groups. There were no statistically significant differences
of clinical and laboratory characteristics between the antihistamine-responsive and antihistamine-unresponsive CIA
groups (Table 3).

Discussion

In the study, we explored a large cohort of patients
referred to the allergology referral center due to chronic
urticaria and/or angioedema and recognized that 2.4% of
patients were characterized by a history of recurrent
angioedema which was not accompanied by urticaria and
was not triggered by identified external agents, including
foods, drugs, Hymenoptera venom, or physical stimuli.
None of them had a family history of angioedema or
were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.
Serum levels of the complement fractions C3 and C4,
antigenic Cr-inhibitor levels and functional Cr-inhibitor
levels, as well as serum protein electrophoresis were normal in all cases. Therefore, these patients were defined as
suffering from CIA. Although CIA is felt to be the most
common cause of CA, its true epidemiology is not
known. It was previously recognized that in about 10%
cases of CSU, angioedema occurs alone without accompanying urticaria."** This number is much higher than the
2.4% found in our study, and this discrepancy might be
explained by the fact that the previous estimation was
drawn from rather small cohorts having CSU.* In a previ

Eli et al.

ous study of 776 patients with recurrent angioedema
without urticaria, 38% of cases were defined as CIA,*
and we diagnosed CIA in 39.2% of patients with CA.

Nowadays, the natural course of CIA is largely
unknown, although it is accepted that many patients with
CSU will suffer for more than one year or much longer.*®
The mean duration of the disease in our study was similar
in the CIA, CU, and CU + CA groups. Moreover, there
was definitely no difference in the clinical (except the
presence of urticaria) and laboratory characteristics
between the CIA, CU, and CU + CA groups. Therefore,
our observation is in agreement with the accepted
assumption that CIA possibly represents a clinical variant
of CSU. Currently, in CIA, a trial of non-sedating antihistamines, administered twice daily, is suggested as an initial intervention.t As in the previous study,+ we also
observed a significant improvement or resolution of the
angioedema with this intervention in most of our
patients, although other experts describe less success in
preventing angioedema recurrence even with higher doses
of antihistamines and no response in up to 30% of
patients with CIA.°%'' Responsiveness to antihistamines
may suggest a possible role of mast-cell- or basophil-mediated processes in the pathophysiology of antihistamineresponsive CIA. Mast-cell-mediated angioedema is pathologically similar to urticaria, although it takes place in
the deeper levels of the dermis and subcutaneous tissues.°
The reason why in CIA there are no other clinical signs
of mast cell/basophil activation, such as pruritus, urticarial, and dermatographism, is largely unknown and will
have to be elucidated in future studies.

Another interesting observation of the study is the lack
of difference in clinical or laboratory features between
patients with antihistamine-responsive and antihistamineunresponsive CIA. We have observed an impressive and
sustained clinical effect of tranexamic acid in most cases of
antihistamine-unresponsive CIA that is in agreement with
previous observations.*'* "+ The pathophysiology of antihistamine-unresponsive CIA is mostly speculative, and several biological mediators acting as triggers or enhancers of
vascular permeability have been implicated.'*’'® Recently,
investigational therapies (dapsone, icatibant [bradykinin
Bz receptor antagonist], and rituximab [B-cell depleting
anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody|) have been reported in
severe and refractory cases.*7 *?

An additional finding of our study is that some patients
with antihistamine-responsive — and
unresponsive CIA react to intradermal injection of AS.
This is a discrepancy with a previous study by Tedeschi
et al.,*° which reported that patients with CIA have a
negative ASST and do not show significant circulating
histamine-releasing activity, unlike patients with CU and
CU + CA, who often show autoreactivity. This finding

patients with ASST-positive CIA.*4 In a recent experimental study, mast cells were found to be critically involved
in serum-mediated vascular leakage in CSU through an
IgE- and IgG-independent mechanism,** and these cells
are present in increased numbers in the skin of patients
with CSU.** Histamine, when released, acting through its
Hr receptor, leads to parasympathetic nerve stimulation
and increased vascular permeability,*? which in turn
results in the formation of angioedema.**

The recently proposed gold standard for autoimmune
CSU diagnosis should be a combination of a positive bioassay (basophil histamine release assays or basophil activation marker expression), positive autoreactivity (by
means of a positive ASST), and a positive immunoassay
(for specific IgG autoantibodies against FceRla and/or
anti-IgE).*? If we consider CIA as a special subtype of
CSU, an additional bioassay and immunoassays have to
be performed, which would allow to confidently distinguish subjects with autoimmune mechanisms from those
wi

th other etiological patterns of CA.

We recently observed a lack of suppression of AS-mediated weal induction by high-dose antihistamines in some
patients with CSU, which supports a role played by other
biological factors, possibly present in serum of patients
with CSU, and may be responsible for weal and flare
reactions by increasing endothelial permeability and endothelial cell leakage.*° The hypothesized biological factors

in AS may be related to bradykinin-forming cascade and
the complement pathways.**

An additional interesting observation of the study is
that affection of oropharyngeal and genital regions were
more commonly seen in CIA than in patients with
CU + CA. Oropharyngeal and genital angioedema in CIA
may be induced both by histamine** and/or by bradykinin.‘* We can only speculate that in CIA the contact
pathway and bradykinin production are more activated
than in CU + CA, which leads to increased vascular permeability and vasodilation in the body areas with relatively little supporting connective tissue, where edema
develops easily.

The latest studies have also found that activation of the
coagulation cascade resulting in thrombin production is
associated with CSU.* 35 Moreover, several studies have
shown that thrombin participates in mast cell degranulation by activating protein kinase receptors on the mast
cell surface.*> Thrombin and bradykinin initiate discrete
endothelial solute permeability in cutis and mucosa.?°
Additionally, complement activation with Csa (anaphylotoxin) generation in the absence of C3 by thrombin takes
the place in CSU.*” Therefore, it has been proposed that
CSU is a disease at the crossroads between autoimmunity
and coagulation.3* To evaluate thrombin activation in
CIA, the autologous plasma skin test could be per
 

formed.*? Regretfully, we did not
plasma skin test in our patients, and this issue is to be
investigated in future studies.

CU groups, than in the control group. Basopenia in CSU
is well recognized from previous studies.4*°4° 47 Circulating basophils may be recruited from blood into urticarial
weals during disease activity, and basopenia was found
associated with serum basophil histamine-releasing activity in patients with CSU.4% Besides the basopenia, intrin
 

sic defects of the anti-IgE cross-linking signaling pathway
of basophils have been described in CSU.**

In summary, our study provides an overview of CIA
based on_ its and laboratory features. We
understand that the study has several limitations, mainly

clinical
related to its retrospective nature with a possible recording
bias and a small number of subjects. The lack of evidence

about activation of the coagulation cascade resulting in

thrombin production in CIA is an additional limitation of
our study. Bigger prospective, multicenter epidemiological
studies are needed to better characterize CIA.
