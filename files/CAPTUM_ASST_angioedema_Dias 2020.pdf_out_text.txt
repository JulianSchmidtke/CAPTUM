Introduction

Summary

Objective. Describing routine procedures, clinical profile and evolution of | patients treated
in a chronic urticaria (CU) reference center of a university hospital. Methods. Retrospective
analysis of clinical records and database of CU patients registered between March 2011 and
February 2016 in a reference center. Besides demographic characteristics, disease duration,
comorbidities, angioedema, thyroid lab tests, urticaria subtypes, provocation tests, UAS and
CUQ20L scores were recorded. Patients with 3 or more visits were included in analysis regarding the first and last visits, to evaluate pharmacological treatment and differences of UAS/
CUQ20L scores, antihistamines (anti-H 1) dosages and need of other medications, according
urticaria subtypes. Results. During the study, 252 patients were attended, 200 with CU,
including 162 women, median age 45 years (perc 25 - 75 = 27 - 58) and median duration
of symptoms before diagnosis 24 months (perc 25 - 75 = 9 - 60). Regarding the etiology, 166
(83%) patients had chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), 34 (17%) had isolated chronic
inducible urticaria (CIndU) and 66 (33%), CSU with CIndU. Among the 123 patients followed up for 3 or more visits, first prescription to 106 (86.2%) patients was monotherapy with
anti-H, and associations with other medications were prescribed to 17 (13.8%). At the last
visit, 94 (76.5%) received antihistamines, and 29 (23.5%) used associations. Patients with
CSU + ClndU + ASST positive need more association of anti-H with other medications
than patients with CSU + CIndU and only ClndU (y2 = 7.998; p 0.01). Between first and
last visits, CUQ20L mean scores changed from 35.7 (+ 21.9) to 22.6 (+ 21.0) (Z = -4.833
p < 0.000). Conclusions. Most of the patients presented CSU, frequently associated with
CIndU. There was an improvement in the patients quality of life during the follow-up period.
All patients were treated with antihistamines and there was a great need for doses above the
standardized and also jor combination with other medications, especially in patients with
concomitance of urticaria subtypes.

Etiological investigation and treatment are a challenge for physicians and patients, since about 50% of patients present CSU

Urticaria represents a heterogeneous group of diseases mediated by mast cells, in which wheals and/or angioedema occur
spontaneously or induced. Chronic urticaria (CU) is defined
when symptoms persist for more than six weeks, and is classified as: chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), with known
cause or not, and chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU) in which
identifiable triggering factors are responsible for the development of lesions (1).

due to unknown causes (2), leading to great frustration. Firstline treatment is second-generation antihistamines (anti-H1) at
licensed dose. However, response to this therapy is not always
satisfactory, and further medication is often required (1).

Chronic urticaria interferes with well-being and daily life, causing a decrease in quality of life (QoL) and affecting school, work
and leisure activities. Analysis of disease severity and its impact
on QoL are indispensable tools in the global evaluation of these

patients (3,4). The follow-up of patients with chronic urticaria
in a specialized/reference outpatient clinic enhances the diagnosis and treatment success (5).

There are few studies about chronic urticaria in Brazilian population. Information of demographic and clinical profiles as well
as of therapeutic management in our country can be of great
value, for researchers and for the daily practice of general practitioners and specialists (6-11).

The aim of this study was to describe the clinical profile and evolution of patients followed up in a chronic urticaria/angioedema
outpatient reference clinic at a university hospital in Brazil.

Material and methods

The study was retrospective, based on the analysis of database
of patients diagnosed with chronic urticaria (CU) evaluated in
the chronic urticaria outpatient clinic of Policlinica Piquet Carneiro, University of Rio de Janeiro State (PPC-UERJ), in the
period of March 2011 to February 2016. This specialized unit
receives patients referred by the PPC/UERJ general allergy outpatient clinic and other university centers, which are evaluated.
through a standardized protocol. The diagnosis of chronic urticaria was clinically defined by clinical history with occurrence
of erythematous, papular, pruritic, intermittent lesions for a
period of more than six weeks, with or without angioedema. Patients referred with other diagnoses as acute urticaria/angioedema, chronic pruritus and dermatitis were not included in the
analysis.

After confirmation of the diagnosis, patients were submitted to
ClIndU provocation tests according to clinical history. Anti-H1
were stopped seven days before testing. For diagnosis of the
symptomatic dermographism (SD), FricTest® is placed vertically and a cross path is performed on the volar surface of the forearm, to an extent of approximately 60 mm. A positive response
to this test is considered when a pruritic palpable wheal of > 3
mm width is present within 10 minutes after the challenge. For
evaluation of cold and heat urticaria, respectively, an ice cube
inside a plastic bag and a glass cylinder with hot water at 44 °C
are applied to forearm skin for five minutes. The test responses
were evaluated 10 minutes after challenge completion, and were
considered positive if test site showed a palpable, visible wheal
and flare-type skin. Delayed pressure urticaria was evaluated by
suspension of a weight rod (diameter 1.5 cm, 2.5 Kg) over volar
forearm for 15 minutes, and test response was assessed 6 hours
after the end of provocation testing. The presence of a red palpable swelling at the application site was considered positive (12).
Autologous serum skin test (ASST) and autologous plasma skin
test (APST) were indicated in patients with urticaria refractory
to treatment with standardized dose anti-H1, and that tolerated
discontinuation these drugs use 7 days before testing. Venous
blood was collected into sterile glass tubes, without accelerator

or anticoagulant for serum, and with sodium citrate for plasma.
Blood was allowed to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes
before separation, which is done with a bench centrifuge at relative centrifugal force of 500 g for 10 minutes. The ASST and
APST were performed by intradermal injection of 0.05 ml of
serum, plasma and sterile physiological normal saline (NS) and
a positive histamine control by skin prick testing (10 mg/ml)
in volar forearm. After 30 minutes, the mean of the maximum
perpendicular diameters of any red wheal reactions to the ASST,
APST and the NS control skin test were calculated. ASST/
APST were positive if ASST/APST mean wheal - NS mean
wheal > 1.5 mm (13).
The disease severity was assessed by the physician in-clinic urticaria activity score (UAS), a commonly used Patient Report

 

Outcome measure that assesses the key sign (wheals) and symptom (itch) of CSU, in all medical visits. This score was recorded
by the patient and evaluated both number of wheals (0 = none;
1 = 1-20 wheals; 2 = 21-50; 3 = > 50) and intensity of itch (0 =
none; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = intense) in the last 24 hours,
ona scale of 0 to 6. The 0 score corresponds to the controlled
disease, while 6 score to great intensity disease (1).

Qol was also assessed in all medical visits, through Chronic
Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire (CUQ,oL). This tool

comprises 23 items, which in the original in Italian are divided

 

into six domains and, in the Portuguese validated version (Brazilian culture), into three: I, sleep / mental state / feeding; II,
pruritus / impact on activities; and III, edema / limitations /
appearance. (8) The patient should respond taking account into
the last two weeks, indicating ina five-point Likert scale the
intensity of each item separately, ranging from 1 = “nothing”
to 5 = “very much”. For each of the three dimensions a score
is calculated, and then a total score is given for all dimensions.
The score ranges from a minimum of 23 to a maximum of 115,
indicating a better and worse overall quality of life, respectively.
In order to make scores more meaningful and to permit comparisons between different populations of patients, linear transformations of raw scores indicating the percent of maximum
possible score were performed. Thus, the minimum possible
score is defined as 0 and the maximum possible score is defined
as 100 (8,14).

In addition, thyroid laboratory tests (free T4, TSH, and thyroid autoantibodies [TAA] as thyroid peroxidase antibody [anti-TPO] and thyroglobulin antibody [anti-TG]), which are
routinely collected on the suspicion of CU in our service, were
requested for all patients.

Besides socio-demographic characteristics as age and gender, the
following clinical data was recorded: presence of angioedema,
urticaria subtypes (CSU, CIndU), comorbidities (atopic, cardiovascular, psychiatric, rheumatologic, endocrinological and
oncological diseases), time between the onset of symptoms and
the first medical visit, results of provocation tests, ASST/APST,

thyroid laboratory tests, UAS ratings (scores < 4 and > 4) and
CUQ,oL scores at first consult of all patients with CU attended
at the outpatient clinic during the study period. The distribution of results of thyroid autoantibodies and ASST was evaluated, as well as CUQ,oL scores according to UAS ratings.
Patients with > 3 visits to the urticaria outpatient clinic were
included in analysis regarding the first and last visits, to evaluate
pharmacological treatment and differences of CUQ,oL scores,
UAS ratings, anti-H1 dosages (on demand and single dose versus up to four times the standard dose) and need for medications associated with anti-H1, according urticaria subtypes (isolated CIndU; CSU + CIndU; CSU + CIndU + ASST positive).
We also analyzed frequency of patients who were discharged
from the outpatient clinic, who interrupted follow-up, and
those who were being followed. up in February 2016, and analyzed UAS/CUQ,oL scores in the first and last visit between
patients in follow-up, and who interrupted follow-up, with the
objective of evaluating whether severity and impact on quality
of life are related to follow-up abandonment.

Descriptive statistics were reported by frequency and means
+ standard deviation (SD) and medians (interquartile range
[IQR]). Prevalence rates are shown as percentages. The chisquare and McNemar’s tests were used to study the relationship between qualitative variables. Non-parametric (Wilcoxon,
U-Mann Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis) tests were used to study
the relationship between continuous variables. Significance was
achieved with p < 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using

SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

 

Ethical aspects

This study followed the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Research Ethics Committees of
the Institute of Public Health of the University of the State of
Rio de Janeiro (Process no. 1.675.616/2017). Confidentiality of
data was ensured throughout the study.

Results

During the study period, 252 patients were attended in the
chronic urticaria outpatient clinic, 52 of whom had no chronic urticaria (UC). The most frequent diagnoses among these
group were chronic pruritus (13), acute urticaria (13), acute
angioedema (10), atopic dermatitis (2), contact dermatitis (5)
and others (9).

From the 200 CU patients seen at the first evaluation with
median age 45 years (IQR 27 - 58 years; range 5 - 82 years),
162 (81%) were female and 29 (14.5%), children. The median
time between the onset of urticaria and the first evaluation was
24 months (IQR 9 - 60 months; range 2 - 564 months), 82
(41.0%) had symptoms for less than 1 year, 21 (16.0%) less

than 2 years, 40 (20.0%) for 2-5 years and 46 (23.0%) for more
than five years.

About 112 (55.0%) patients also complained of angioedema
episodes. The most common comorbidities were arterial hypertension in 57 (28.5%) patients, allergic rhinitis in 50 (25.0%),
asthma in 19 (9.5%), hypothyroidism in 17 (8.5%), rheumatological diseases in 11 (5.5%), oncological diseases in 8 (4.0%),
psychiatric diseases in 7 (3.5%) and atopic dermatitis in 3
(1.5%) (table I). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs triggered urticaria in 29 (14.5%) patients, antibiotics in 7 (3.5%),
whereas ACE-inhibitors and dexchlorpheniramine maleate in
only one patient each.

Regarding the etiology, 166 (83.0%) patients had CSU and 34
(17.0%) had isolated CindU. Sixty-six (33.0%) patients with
CSU presented CindU (table I).

All patients underwent provocation tests for dermographism
with 86 (43.0%) positive tests, 79 for cold with 8 (10.1%), 78
for heat with 3 (3.8%), 64 for delayed pressure with 7 (10.9%),
76 for ASST with 41 (53.9%), and 72 and for APST with 28
(38.8%).
Thyroid laboratory tests were requested for all patients, but only
146 performed thyroid hormone serum levels (T4 and TSH)
and 121 thyroid autoantibodies measurements (anti-TPO and
anti-TG). Of these, 15 (10.2%) presented alterations in hormonal levels (8 patients T4 normal and TSH high, 4 patients
T4 normal and TSH low, 3 patients T4 high and TSH normal)
and 22 (18.2%) positive thyroid autoantibodies (TAA). In a
subset of 54 patients submitted to ASST and TAA measurements, it was observed: 30 ASST positive 8 (26.7%) patients
with increased TAA serum levels, and 22 (73.3%) normal, and
24 ASST negative, two (8.3%) positive patients with increased
TAA serum levels, and 22 (91.7%) normal.

The CUQ,oL median scores (0 - 100) on the first visit was 26.2
(IQR 13.35 - 44.10; range 0 - 78.62). Physician in-clinic UAS
scores < 4 were observed in 171 (85.5%) patients and > 4 in 28
(14.5%), with 88 (44.0%) patients that presented pruritus, and
only 48 (24.0%) that had wheals at the time of the first evaluation. The CUQ,oL scores are high (i.e. worse) in patients with
UAS scores = 4 (U 832.000; p < 0.000) (table I).

 

Follow-up data

The clinical characteristics of the 123 patients followed by 3
or more medical visits are very similar to the patients seen at
least once, as seen in table I. Among these patients, 22 were
followed-up for less than one year, 50 for one, 23 for two and 28
for three to five years, with median follow-up time of 14 months
(IQR 7 - 27 months; range 2 - 58).

Only eleven patients (9%) were discharged due to disease remission, 42 (34%) interrupted the follow-up and 70 (57%) were
still under follow-up in February 2016. Patients in remission

presented median time of disease progression at the first evaluation of 48 months (IQR 6 - 60 months), follow-up time in our
clinic of 21 months (IQR 12 - 30) and disease time at discharge
of 72 months (IQR 31 - 83). Among those who remained in
follow-up in February 2016, medians were respectively 25
months (IQR 12 - 84), 16 months (IQR 9 - 34) and 54 months
(IQR 31 - 101) in the last clinic consultation.

Between first and last visits CU-Q,oL mean scores changed
from 35.7 (+ 21.9) to 22.6 (+ 21.0) (Z -4.833; p < 0.000), although the physician in-clinic UAS scores demonstrated a less
significant change between visits (p 0.04) (table II).

On the first visit, patients were treated with anti-H1, 106
(86.2%) as monotherapy and 17 (13.8%) with combination
with other medications. In 16 patients (13.0%) the dosage of
anti-H1 was on demand, in 56 (45,5%) the maintenance dose
was standardized and 51 (41,5%) received up to four times the
standard dose (table III).

On the other hand, the therapeutic regimen used in the last
visit of these patients was anti-H1 monotherapy for 94 patients (76.5%), while 61.8% of them used twofold to fourfold
doses, with relevant difference between the two assessments (p
0.008; p < 0.000 respectively) (table III). The most frequently prescribed anti-H1 were, in their respective order, cetirizine,
hydroxyzine and fexofenadine. Associations with other drugs
were necessary in 29 (23.5%) patients, being the most common
doxepin (17), followed by oral corticosteroids in short courses
for exacerbations (13), montelukast (3), anti-IgE (3) and cyclosporin (2). Seven patients needed association with two or more
medications (figure 1).

Treatment with anti-IgE and cyclosporin was necessary in
five patients, all women with associated angioedema; two
had hypothyroidism; one rheumatoid arthritis, and two
ASST positivity.

CUQ2oL scores, UAS groups, need of anti-H1 association
with other medications and anti-H1 posology in first and last
visit according CU subtypes (only CIndU, CSU + ClIndU,
CSU + CIndU + ASST positive) were evaluated. A tendency to
better quality of life in patients with CIndU at the first visit (p
0.07) was observed. In the last visit was observed major association of anti-H1 with other medications in patients with CSU
+ CIndU +ASST positive (y2 7.998; p 0.01), and a trend not
statistically proven for the use of doses above the standard doses

in this group of patients (¥2 5.558; p 0.06) (table IV).

Discussion

In this study, clinical profile and evolution of CU patients followed-up at a subspecialized university outpatient clinic was described. The patients were admitted with two years of average
time of disease and after being treated by several specialists and
submitted to many treatments (as about 30% presented symptoms for at least five years), demonstrating the difficulty in appropriate diagnosis and management of this disease (3).

Most of the evaluated patients had CSU, of which 33% associated with CIndU. Maurer et al. (3) evaluated the prevalence and

that in patients presenting with nonacute urticaria, 66 to 93%
had CSU, from 4 to 33% had CindU, and cholinergic urti
caria diagnosis varied from 1 to 7%, being the combination of

CSU with CindU common. The frequency of CU subtypes in
the Brazilian population is still little known. In a study carried
out in Sao Paulo in 2011 with a sample of 62 patients, authors

found a frequency of 32.3% of CSU, 27.4% of CindU alone

and 40.3% of CSU/CindU association (10). Another study
published in the same year in Rio de Janeiro, with 112 patients,
showed that 36% of patients presented CSU, 24% isolated CindU and 44% associated CSU/CIndU (8).

Urticaria symptoms are brought about by activated skin mast
cells and their subsequent release of histamine and other proinflammatory mediators. The underlying causes and the mechanisms of mast cell activation in most types of urticaria are
unknown, and remain to be identified. The presence of IgG
autoantibodies against IgE receptors, or IgE and IgE anti-autoantigens as thyroid peroxidase (TPO) on the membrane of basophils and cutaneous mast cells, shows an association between
CU and autoimmunity (13,15). ASST/APST are in vivo tests
that evaluate autoreactivity, but do not define the diagnosis of
chronic autoimmune urticaria. They indicate, when positive,
that there may be autoantibodies or other soluble factors potentially involved in the degranulation of cutaneous mast cells. This
method should be complemented, if possible, with basophil
histamine releasing test and specific IgG autoantibodies against
FceRIa and/or anti-IgE immunoassay to demonstrate antibody
specificity (7,13).

Asero et al. have reported that the autologous plasma skin test
(APST) is more sensitive than ASST, which was not confirmed
by other authors (16-18). In the urticaria outpatient clinic we
routinely performed ASST and APST to evaluate the two tests.
In the descriptive analysis of this sample we found 53.9% of
positivity for ASST and 38.8% for APST. The comparison between the two methods is not the objective of the present research, but a higher positivity of the ASST is observed in our
series.

Considering that autoimmune factors may be common features
of both thyroid autoimmunity and urticaria, it is likely that
both may coexist within the same patient. We found elevated
thyroid autoantibodies serum levels in 18.3% patients, that
were present in 26.7% of those ASST positive and 8.3% in negative ones. In a systematic review about CSU and autoimmune
thyroid diseases, the authors found the frequency of elevated
thyroid autoantibodies varying from 3.7% to 37.1% (19).
Among patients followed up in the service for at least three
visits, just a small portion was free of disease (less than 10%),
with disease time at discharge of 72 months. Van der Valk et
al. in a retrospective study with 372 adults identified remission
after 5 and 10 years in 29% and 44% of patients, respectively
(20). In another retrospective study, Kulthanan et al. revealed
at in 337 adults with CSU, 34.5% had remission after 1 year
(21). Kozel et al. prospectively measured 220 adults for 3 years
and found that 35% of CU patients after 1 year did not present
any more symptoms (22). In our study, the disease presented a

 

 

o

longer course, which may have occurred because it is a referral
service in a tertiary hospital, where the CU duration may be
greater.

About 34% patients abandoned treatment, which draws attention to this high dropout rate. Nevertheless, this group had a
lower impact on quality of life at the last visit to the service
than the patients still in follow-up, which may suggest that the
abandonment of the follow-up may be partially related to the
improvement or remission of the disease.

The pillars of chronic urticaria management are avoiding triggering factors and pharmacotherapy. The first line treatment is
modern second generation anti-H1 in a standardized dose (1),
but symptoms improve in less than 50% of patients using this
dose (3). Doses above the standard were prescribed for 41.4%
of our follow-up group already in the first consultation, since
they were previously treated without adequate control, which is
a frequent finding in referral services like ours. Anti-H1 monotherapy was instituted in 86.2% of the patients at the first consultation in the follow-up sample, being cetirizine the anti-H1
of choice because of its low cost in our country. As it is available free of charge in public health system, hydroxyzine, a first
generation anti-H1 with sedative action, was the second most
prescribed antihistamine. Doxepin is a tricyclic antidepressant,
which acts through the mixed inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine recapture, presenting antihistaminic and sedative
properties was used in 13.8% of patients (23). In 2014, the
AAAAI recommended the use of first-generation anti-H1 or
doxepin at night as a third-line treatment of chronic urticaria (24,25). However, in most recent 2017 EAACI/GA2LEN/
EDF/WAO guideline, the recommendation for CU treatment
is up dosing second generation anti-H1 up to fourfold in patients unresponsive to second generation anti-H1 usual dose. If
there is no improvement, it is recommend adding on omalizumab, now their third line treatment proposal.
Regarding treatment in the last medical visit, it was observed
that there was a need to increase the standardized dose of anti-H1 in 61.8% of patients and to association with other drugs
in 23.5% to achieve control. Patients who present CSU + CInU + ASST positive need more association of other medication
to anti-H1 and also a trend to use doses above the standard doses than patients with only CIndU or CSU + CIndU, showing
that patients with ASST positive are more refractory to anti-H1.

 

 

However, several studies, support that a positive ASST is linked
to severe disease, and in our study, we did not find this association (26,27).

Only three patients used anti-IgE until February 2016, since it
is available for clinical use in Brazil only since December 2015.
Anti IgE access is still a problem in our country and patients frequent request it judicially from the State government or health
insurance, because it is not provided by public health services.
Currently, 16 patients with refractory CU are on treatment with
anti IgE in our Unit.

The use of UAS and CUQ,oL helps to monitor the evolution
of the disease and the efficacy of treatment. The UAS and
Clinical experience of a chronic urticaria referral university center

CUQ,oL scores at the first visit were low, due to the heterogeneity of the patients with only 88 (44.0%) patients that presented pruritus, and 48 (24.0%) that had wheals at the first
evaluation. The majority of patients’ sample analyzed presented mild urticaria activity with low quality of life impairment.
However, the evaluation of the CUQ oL scores according to
UAS showed that patients with higher disease activity have a
worse impact on QoL. A significant decrease of CUQ,oL scores
was observed in the follow-up of the patients, which suggests a
better control of the disease (28). The analysis of CUQ,oLand
UAS according to diagnostic subtypes showed no relevant
differences except for a tendency to improve quality of life in
patients with CIndU at the first visit. However, it should be
mentioned that UAS and CUQ,oL do not evaluate adequately
patients with CIndU, since their questions are not specific for
this type of urticaria (29).

The best method for assessing activity is UAS7, since this instrument evaluates the seven days prior to the consultation,
evaluating more broadly a disease that has a fluctuating course.
Its limitations are the inability to perform at the first consultation and dependence on patient compliance. If UAS7 had been
used in the evaluation of the last visit, we would probably have
a more accurate analysis of the disease activity. We did not use
UAS7 routinely during all period of this study. Only 17 patients answered UAS7 at the last medical visit. Some patients
do not understand, and other forget to fill the diary and bring
it. About two years ago we regularized the UAS7 use, but the
rate of return of this tool has been low, and only patients with
more severe disease tend to use UAS7 adequately. Measures to
increase adherence to this tool were implemented, and currently
the rate of compliance is improving.

Our study had some limitations that must be considered. This
study was performed in a single tertiary center; therefore, selection bias might have occurred. It should be considered that is a
retrospective study, with analysis of patients’ database, and some
information as results of thyroid lab tests were not available for
all patients. There might be patients with hypo or hyperthyroidism and positive autoantibodies that were not evaluated.
Another limitation already mentioned above was a low use of
UAS7, which possibly would be a more sensitive tool than physician in-clinic UAS in assessing disease activity. Despite these
limitations, we provide useful information regarding the natural
course time of CU, disease severity, quality of life and pharmacological treatment prior to the introduction of anti-IgE in
chronic urticaria therapy in our country.

Conclusions

Most of our patients presented CSU to which CIndU was
frequently associated. All patients were treated with antihistamines and there was a great need for doses above standardized,
and also for combination with other medications. We have
difficulties in the access to immunobiological therapy, which
costs are still a barrier to its use in most of our patients. The
disease has a prolonged course and at the time of discharge
many patients had symptoms for more than five years. The use
of standardized questionnaires for CU have been shown to be
important tools to optimize the follow-up and treatment of
this challenging disease, which has impact on patients’ quality
of life. Measures to reduce patients withdraw from treatment
and to recover these patients are required in an outpatient clinic specializing in CU.
