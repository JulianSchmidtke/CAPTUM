Summary. Background: Complement component 5a
(C5a) might be involved in the formation of wheals in
patients with chronic urticaria (CU). We sought to compare the in vitro responsiveness of basophils to C5a in
patients with CU and in a control group.

Methods: Basophil surface expression of activation
marker CD63 induced by CSa, anti-FceRI mAb or antiIgE pAb was measured using flow cytometry in 17 patients with CU and in 10 healthy controls.

Results: Patients with CU showed significantly
greater basophil CD63 surface expression induced by
C5a (median [interquartile range]; 16.4% [13-25.1]; P =
0.011) than the group of healthy controls (10.7%
[7.2-16.8]). In contrast, basophil CD63 response to antiIgE and anti-FceRI was lower in the CU group (12.3%
[6-36.3]; 25.9% [12.5-60.5]) than in the control group
(51.7% [6.7-84.3]; 62.1% [9.7-89.2]), although not statistically significant.

Conclusion: Results of this pilot study suggest that
patients with CU might have an enhanced basophil response to stimulation with C5a, indicating that further
studies in CU basophil responsiveness are needed.

Key words: Chronic urticaria, basophils, C5a, CD63.

Introduction

Chronic urticaria (CU) is defined as the daily or almost
daily occurrence of wheals for at least six weeks, physical urticaria and urticarial vasculitis having been excluded. The pathogenesis of CU is not thoroughly understood, although mast cell degranulation and histamine release are believed to be of a central importance
[1]. A subpopulation of patients have an autoimmune
disorder associated with autoantibodies against the
high-affinity IgE receptor FceRI [2] and/or IgE [3] or with
circulating antibodies against various thyroid antigens
[4]. Other triggers such as chronic Helicobacter pylori
gastritis could also be involved [5]. Anti-IgE receptor autoantibodies are thought to cause mast cell and basophil degranulation by cross-linking of the o-chain of

FceRI (2, 3]. However, recent data suggest that this activation is further augmented by complement activation
[6, 7] and release of complement component 5a (C5a) [8].
C5a acts directly through the G-protein-coupled C5a receptor on basophils or dermal mast cells and can induce both rapid and long-lasting cellular responses [9].
C5a is also a chemotactic factor for neutrophils, basophils and eosinophils, which are present in CU lesions
[10]. Although in vitro C5a-mediated release of basophils and mast cells may be altered in several allergic
and non-allergic conditions [11], there is a lack of data
on C5a-induced basophil or mast cell response in patients with CU. However, in patients with CU it has been
shown that basophils have reduced capacity for releasing mediators when activated through IgE receptors
[12-13]. We wished to establish, by measuring surface
expression of CD63 (glycoprotein 53) as a marker of basophil activation [14], whether basophils from patients
with CU show an altered response to C5a-induced in
vitro stimulation in comparison with healthy control
persons.

Materials and methods
Study participants

We recruited 17 CU patients with recurrent whealing occurring at least four times a week for an average of 45 months
(range 6-132) without clinical evidence of physically induced
urticaria or of urticarial vasculitis. The average age of the patients was 51 years (range 34-70) and 12 were women. Ten
healthy persons (average age 38 years; age range 28-49, 6 of
whom were women) served as the control group. Controls were
matched for sex but were younger than the patients. The clinical and laboratory characterization of the CU patients is summarized in Table 1. Antihistamine treatment was stopped at
least four days before blood samples were collected and none
of the patients was taking glucocorticoids, immunosuppressive drugs or tricyclic antidepressants at the time of venipuncture or in the past month. The study was approved by the National Ethics Committee and written informed consent was
obtained from the participants.

Materials

Recombinant human CS5a was obtained from Sigma Chemicals (St Louis, MO), mouse anti-FceRI mAb from Biihlmann
Laboratories (Allschwil, Switzerland) and goat anti-IgE pAb
from Caltag Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). C5a was dissolved

in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at —-80°C. For stimulation of
basophils, C5a was diluted 1/1000 in cell incubation medium.
The final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide (0.1% vol/vol)
had no effect on cellular function (data not shown).

Preparation of peripheral blood leukocytes

For the basophil activation assay, 9 ml of whole blood collected in EDTA tubes (Vacutainer, BD, Plymouth, UK) was centrifuged at 550 x g for 10 min at 4°C; the buffy coat was collected
(0.5 ml) and centrifuged again. The supernatant was discarded
and the cell pellet resuspended in 450 pl of HEPES calcium
stimulation buffer containing 2 ng/ml of interleukin 3 (IL-3)
for 5 min.

Cell stimulation procedure

Cells were stimulated at 37°C in a shaking water bath for
45 min in final concentrations of 1.2 x 10°°M for C5a [8], 0.55 pg/
ml for anti-FceRI (a chain of high-affinity IgE receptor) mAb
and 0.5 pg/ml for anti-IgE pAb. Basal surface expression of
CD63 was determined in the same conditions by adding an
equal volume of corresponding IL-3 containing stimulation
buffer alone.

Basophil activation assay

Surface expression of the basophil activation marker CD63
was measured using the Flow-CAST test (BiihImann Laboratories, Allschwil, Switzerland). Briefly, the stimulation was
stopped by adding blocking buffer (ice-cold HEPES buffer
without calcium and magnesium but with EDTA 0.27 mM) followed by incubation with a mixture of anti-human CD63 mAb
labelled with phycoerythrin (anti-CD63 PE) and anti-human
IgE labelled with fluorescent isothiocyanate (anti-IgE FITC).
After incubation for 30 min on ice, lysing reagent was added

Table 1. Clinical and laboratory

for 4 min at room temperature. Cell lysis was stopped with
blocking buffer and after centrifugation the cells were resuspended in blocking buffer and analyzed within 2 hours on a
FACSCalibur flow cytometer with CELLQuest software (BD,
San Jose, CA). The initial cell gate was defined on a histogram
by forward and side scatter around lymphocytes and the second gate was defined around cells showing bright IgE expression identifying them as basophils. IgE-carrying monocytes
and dendritic cells were excluded from the analysis by their
different forward and side scatter characteristics and dim expression of IgE. CD63 surface expression was determined by
analyzing 150-500 basophils in each probe. The percentage of
activation was calculated as the number of cells positive for
anti-IgE and anti-CD63 compared with the total number of
anti-IgE positive cells. Other parameters were given simultaneously by FACS as the percentage of the anti-IgE positive
population.

Statistical analysis

The distribution of data was recalculated using the ShapiroWilk normality test. The data were not normally distributed,
therefore a Mann-Whitney U test was used to study differences between the groups. The strength of association between variables was obtained with the Spearman rank-order
method. Probability values of P <0.05 were accepted as significant. Unless otherwise stated, results are given as medians
and interquartile ranges (IQR). GraphPad Prism 5 software
was used for the analyses.

Results

The percentage of bright anti-IgE positive cells (basophils) in patients with CU (median [IQR]; 0.7% [0.4-1.2])
was not significantly different from the healthy control
group (1.1% [0.7-1.7]; P = 0.23).There were no significant

differences in the basal percentage of basophil CD63
surface expression between CU patients (5.5% [4-7.2])
and the control group (5.2% [3.7-6.2]; P = 0.53). However,
after stimulation with C5a, the percentage of CD63-expressing basophils was significantly higher in CU patients (16.4% [13-5.1]; P = 0.011) than in healthy controls
(10.7% [7.2-16.8]) (Fig. 1). In contrast, the basophil response to anti-IgE pAb and anti-FceRI mAb was lower in
patients with CU (12.4% [6-36.3]; 25.9% [12.5-60.5])
than in the control group (51.7% [6.7-84.3]; 62.1%
[9.7-89.2]), although the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.18; P = 0.17) (Fig. 2). There was a
highly significant positive correlation between the basophil response to anti-IgE pAb and anti-FceRI mAb
stimulation (R = 0.8, P = 0.0001). There was no correlation between other variables.

Clinical and laboratory data in subgroups of CU patients were also compared. We could not find any significant differences in C5a, anti-IgE pAb or anti-FceRI
mAb basophil responsiveness between CU subgroups
according to occurrence of angioedema (P = 0.87, 0.1 or
0.28), positive autologous serum skin-test results (P =
0.11, 0.42 or 0.59), elevated levels of Ab to thyroid (P =
0.76, 0.51 or 0.86) H. pylori (P = 0.42, 0.13 or 0.54) or
clinical history of ASA intolerance (P = 0.71, 0.79 or
0.23).

Discussion

Previous studies showed that basophil IgE-dependent
release of histamine and sulfidoleukotrienes is reduced
in patients with CU in comparison with healthy persons
(12, 13]. Our findings demonstrate a similar trend, as
basophil activation induced by anti-FceRI or anti-IgE
stimuli tended to be lower in patients with CU. However, we showed that basophils from patients with CU displayed an increased response after activation with ana

phylotoxin C5a. The contrasting effect of an anti-IgE
receptor-triggered response and a C5a triggered response was demonstrated by surface up-regulation of
basophil activation marker CD63 [14].

The serum of CU patients induces an inflammatory
response and marked expression of CD63 on basophils
[15]. However, in 2005 Lugin et al. [16] suggested that CU
basophils may be hyporesponsive to C5a stimulation.
Nevertheless, the results of their study may have been
influenced by technical problems, as basophile histamine release after C5a stimulation was very low in the
healthy controls, who released only around 4% of the
histamine content after C5a stimulation. In contrast, an
earlier study by Miura and MacGlashan [17], for example, and a recent study by Marsland et al. [18] have
shown that basophils of normal donors release about
40% of their histamine content after C5a stimulation.
Calcineurin inhibitors were able to inhibit the in vitro
release of histamine when basophils were stimulated
with urticaria sera but not when stimulated with C5a
[18].

Many reports have suggested that complement
could play an important role in the pathogenesis of CU
[6-8]. IgG autoantibodies (anti-FceRI or anti-IgE autoantibodies) from patients with CU can induce in vitro
activation of complement [6-7] and liberation of C5a [8],
which contribute to the higher magnitude of histamine
release and may participate in enhanced dermal mastcell degranulation in skin lesions of patients with CU.
Therefore, C5a might also be a potential therapeutic
target in CU. Ying et al. [10] found significant recruitment of basophils into the inflammatory cell infiltrate
in CU lesions. Those basophils might significantly contribute to the enhanced in situ inflammatory response
to C5a. In addition, Ying et al. [10] found that the inflammatory and cytokine profile in the skin lesions of
patients with CU with and without circulating IgG au

toantibodies are the same and that the skin cell infiltration in both subgroups is likely to be the result of a C5amediated chemotactic response. C5a-mediated basophil activation via binding of the G-protein-coupled C5a
receptor induces not only a rapid basophil degranulation response but also continuous generation of leukotriene C4, IL-4 and IL-13 for a period of 16-18 h [9, 19].
This long-lasting cellular response mediated by C5a can
therefore differently promote certain basophil or dermal mast-cell functions.

Recent findings suggest an additional pathogenic
mechanism in CU patients: activation of the coagulation cascade resulting in thrombin production [20].
Thrombin is a serine protease that may play a key role in
urticaria, being able to induce edema through an increase in vascular permeability and mast-cell activation and degranulation, and to induce the production of
C5a. Such mechanisms seem to be active in the majority
of CU patients; however, their relationship with antiFceRI or anti-IgE autoantibodies is still a matter of research.

We also demonstrated that the percentage of basophils showing bright IgE fluorescence was slightly lower
in patients with CU than in healthy control persons.
Indeed, several previous studies have reported basopenia in CU [13, 21], although others have not [12]. An absolute basophil count was not included in our study.

The incidence of asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic
dermatitis in CU patients is comparable with the distribution of these disorders in the population and identification of an external allergen responsible for hive formation is very rare. However, basophils from patients
with allergic disease frequently show an altered in vitro
response to C5a [11], which could be in correlation with
the severity of clinical symptoms. To eliminate the influence of atopy on the variability of the results we
strictly excluded such persons from the study.

Several researchers [11, 22] suggest that C5a is able
to enhance in vitro production of sulfidoleukotrienes in
persons with acetylsalicylic acid intolerance. Hence, it
is interesting that persons with intolerance to single or
multiple non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
showed a high prevalence (30% for single and >90% for
multiple) of positive autologous serum skin tests [23].
Moreover, it was very recently demonstrated that NSAID
intolerance often precedes the onset of CU by years, especially in individuals with acetylsalicylic acid intolerance [24]. Perhaps altered responsiveness to C5a is a
possible link between NSAID intolerance and CU [25].
Nevertheless, in our study we were not able to find any
differences in basophil response to C5a between CU individuals concerning their clinical history of intolerance to acetylsalicylic acid.

In conclusion, we have compared basophil surface
expression of CD63 by various stimuli in patients with
CU and in healthy control persons. The basophils from
the CU patients showed significantly higher activation
after C5a stimulation, indicating that CU basophils
could be targeted very effectively by C5a, which further
suggests their possible importance in the pathogenesis
of CU.
