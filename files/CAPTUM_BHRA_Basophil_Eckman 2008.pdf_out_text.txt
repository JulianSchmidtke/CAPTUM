Basophil Phenotypes in Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria
in Relation to Disease Activity and Autoantibodies

John A. Eckman!, Robert G. Hamilton', Laura M. Gober', Patricia M. Sterba! and Sarbjit S. Saini!

Potentially pathogenic IgG autoantibodies to IgE or its receptor, FceRla, have been detected in ~40% of chronic
idiopathic urticaria (CIU) patients. CIU patients’ basophils display distinct altered FceRla-mediated degranulation. CIU patients with basophil histamine release in response to polyclonal goat anti-human IgE >10% are
classified as CIU responders (CIU-R) and <10% are CIU non-responders (CIU-NR). We compared the presence
of autoantibodies to basophil degranulation phenotypes and to disease status (active or inactive). Sera were
collected from non-ClU subjects and CIU subjects who participated in a longitudinal study of disease severity
and had defined basophil degranulation phenotypes. Immunoenzymetric assays (IEMA) quantified IgG antiFceRlo and anti-IgE. IgG anti-FceRla antibody was detected in 57% of CIU-R (n= 35), 55% of CIU-NR (n= 29), and
57% of non-ClU subjects (n = 23), whereas IgG anti-lgE was present in 43% of CIU-R, 45% of CIU-NR, and 30% of
non-ClU subjects. Both the autoantibody levels and the functional basophil phenotype remained stable in
subjects with active disease (n=16), whereas there was an enhancement in basophil function as subjects
evolved into a state of remission (n=6), which appears independent of the presence of autoantibody. IEMAs
detected a similar frequency of autoantibodies in CIU-R, CIU-NR, and non-ClU subjects. Basophil function may
be independent of IEMA-detected autoantibodies.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is a clinical state that is
defined by >6 weeks of hives with no identifiable cause
(Greaves, 1995). Its prevalence is approximately 0.1% in the
United States (Greaves, 2000). CIU has the greatest impact on
the quality of life of any allergic disease (O’Donnell et al.,
1997; Grob and Gaudy-Marqueste, 2006) and this impact is
similar to that of coronary heart disease and severe atopic
dermatitis (O’Donnell et al., 1997; Poon et al., 1999). The
economic burden is comparable to that of other skin
conditions such as bullous skin diseases and vitiligo, which
require multiple medications, medical evaluations, work
absences, and emergency department use (Bickers et al.,
2006; Delong et al., 2008).

Although the pathogenesis of the majority of cases is
unknown, an autoimmune process has been proposed for a
subset of CIU subjects (Kaplan, 2004). Approximately
35-40% of patients with CIU are thought to possess IgG

autoantibodies to the a-subunit of the high-affinity IgE
receptor (FceRla) (Hide et al., 1993; Fiebiger et al., 1995;
Zweiman et al., 1996; Tong et al., 1997) and approximately
5-10% have naturally occurring IgG anti-lgE autoantibodies
(Gruber et al., 1988; Grattan et al., 1991). These autoantibodies are thought to participate in the pathogenesis by
directly activating skin mast cells in a complement-dependent manner to generate urticaria.
Functional IgG autoantibodies have been demonstrated
in vitro using the histamine release activity (HRA) assay
(Hide et al., 1993; Fiebiger et al., 1995, 1998; Kikuchi and
Kaplan, 2001; Soundararajan et al., 2005). The histaminereleasing activity factor has been localized to the IgG fraction
of serum of CIU patients (Hide et al., 1993; Zweiman et al.,
1996; Fiebiger et al., 1998; Kikuchi and Kaplan, 2001), and
the specificity for the FceRla has been demonstrated in a
limited number of samples (Hide et al., 1993; Kikuchi and
Kaplan, 2001). ELISA and western blot analyses have been
developed to measure IgG anti-FceRla, and the concordance
with HRA has been poor (Fiebiger et a/., 1998; Kikuchi and
Kaplan, 2001; Soundararajan et a/., 2005). Thus, defining the
presence of autoantibodies in CIU serum is complicated by
the lack of a ‘gold standard’ test that confirms the diagnosis
of autoimmune urticaria (Sabroe and Greaves, 2006).
Another line of investigation has shown that blood
basophils from CIU subjects have altered IgE receptormediated degranulation (Greaves et al., 1974; Kern and
Lichtenstein, 1976; Sabroe et al., 1998; Luquin et al., 2005;
Vonakis et al., 2007) Recently, we reported that the ex vivo
activation of basophils from CIU subjects with an optimal

dose of polyclonal anti-IgE antibodies segregates them into
two groups on the basis of degree of their histamine release:
responders (CIU-R) and non-responders (CIU-NR) (Vonakis
et al., 2007). CIU subjects with non-responder basophils
showed depressed histamine release, whereas basophils of
CIU subjects with a responder phenotype displayed histamine release similar to that of healthy control subjects
(Vonakis et al., 2007). Basophil functional phenotype is
stable on or off medication (Vonakis et al., 2007). Demographics of the groups have been published elsewhere
(Baker et al., in press).

Given the existence of basophil functional phenotypes, we
examined the relationship of autoantibody presence and the
basophil functional phenotype in CIU subjects with active
and remissive CIU disease. In this study, we used a panel of
analytically sensitive immunoenzymetric assays (IEMA) to
measure IgG anti-FceRla and naturally occurring IgG anti-IgE
autoantibodies in the serum of CIU subjects over time and in
relation to their basophil phenotype (CIU-R and CIU-NR).

 

RESULTS
IgG anti-FceRla. in the sera from CIU and non-ClU subjects
Sera collected from CIU subjects as part of basophil
phenotyping studies (n= 73) were analyzed for the level of
IgG anti-FceRla autoantibodies. Of these subjects, 64 had
sufficient basophils present in their venous blood sample to
allow characterization of their basophil histamine release
profile as CIU-R (n= 35) or CIU-NR (n= 29). The remaining
nine subjects were basopenic and labeled ‘’CIlU-unclassified’. Using the minimal detectable limit of 200ngmI~',
57% of CIU-R subjects (n= 35) and 55% of CIU-NR subjects
(n=29) had positive IgG anti-FceRla antibody levels (twotailed Fisher’s exact test, P=1.00), whereas 67% of
ClU-unclassified subjects (n=9) had detectable antibody
(two-tailed Fisher’s exact test CIU-R +CIU-NR versus CIUunclassified subjects, P=0.72) (Figure 1a). The latter result
was shown to compare the presence of autoantibodies in the
sera of CIU subjects with measurable basophil histamine
content with that of CIU subjects with extremely low basophil
histamine content. The average IgG anti-FceRlo antibody titers were significantly higher for the ClU-unclassified
subjects (CIU-R: 330458 ng ml"! (SEM), CIU-NR: 322+
50ngml~', and ClU-unclassified: 815 +262 ngml7!; twotailed ttest CIU-R + NR versus ClU-unclassified, P<0.001).

For non-ClU subjects, 57% (n= 23) had detectable IgG
anti-FceRla in their serum, which was not significantly
different from CIU subjects (59%, n= 73) (two-tailed Fisher’s
exact test, P=1.00). The mean concentration of IgG antiFceRla in CIU subjects versus non-ClU subjects was also
not significantly different (CIU: 389ngml~!, non-CIU:
304 ng mI“'; two-tailed t-test, P=0.38).

subjects without a clear basophil functional category (n= 9)
had detectable levels (two-tailed Fisher’s exact test CIUR+CIU-NR versus ClU-unclassified, P=0.29) (Figure 1b).
The average IgG anti-lgE antibody titers were significantly
higher for ClU-unclassified subjects (CIU-R: 267 + 63 ngml7'
(SEM), CIU-NR: 197+422 ngml-', and ClU-unclassified:

For non-ClU subjects, 30% (n= 23) had detectable IgG
anti-IgE in their serum, which was not significantly different
from CIU subjects (n= 73) (two-tailed Fisher’s exact test,
P=0.24). The mean IgG anti-lgE concentration in CIU
versus non-ClU subjects was not significantly different (CIU:
322 ngml~', non-ClU: 339ng ml~'; two-tailed — ttest,
P<0.91).

The distributions of both antibodies in CIU and non-ClU
subjects are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Notably, no correlation
was seen between the degree of basophil IgE receptorstimulated response and the IgG anti-FceRla or IgG anti-lgE
titers (data not shown).

Specificity of the anti-FceRla autoantibody assay was
confirmed with a dose-dependent competitive inhibition
using an overnight incubation of soluble FceRla with six sera
containing the highest levels of IgG anti-FceRla detected in
the study (Figure 2). The serum of each subject contained

Of the 64 CIU subjects with defined basophil phenotype,
basophil functional profiles were measured repeatedly over
time in 25 CIU subjects (CIU-R: n= 12 and CIU-NR: n= 13)
with active disease (Figure 3a). In 12 subjects who were
initially CIU-R, 31 of 33 (94%) subsequent basophil
functional profile measurements repeated over time during
active disease remained within the CIU-R group. In 13
subjects who were initially CIU-NR, 20 of 21 (95%)

Correlation of basophil functional phenotype and IgG

anti-FceRla and IgG anti-IgE autoantibodies in subjects
experiencing disease remission
During the study period, six CIU subjects (CIU-R: n=1 and
CIU-NR: n= 5) entered disease remission, defined by no hive
symptoms or medication use for 2 months. In disease
remission, the CIU-R donors’ basophils demonstrated heightened sensitivity to 0.01 pgml~' anti-IgE. Interestingly, the
basophils of the five CIU-NR subjects who experienced
disease remission demonstrated an increase in the magnitude
of maximal histamine release in response to the optimal
concentration of anti-IgE (0.1 ng ml~') (two-tailed ttest,
P=0.03) (Figure 4a). In contrast to these dramatic shifts in
basophil IgE receptor function, IEMA-measured IgG antiFceRla (Figure 4b) and IgG anti-IgE (Figure 4c) antibody levels
did not exhibit any significant change in CIU subjects with
disease remission. The range of time between active disease
and disease remission was 6-54 months (mean = 20 months).

 

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrate that the prevalence and
quantitative levels of IgG anti-FceRla and anti-lgE in CIU
subjects were similar to those measured in the serum of the
non-CIU population. The specificity of the FceRla-specific
autoantibody IEMA was also confirmed with ~ 80% soluble
FceRla-specific inhibition for all antibody-positive samples
bove 400ngml~'. Moreover, our data indicate that the
attern of basophil functional phenotypes among CIU
atients (CIU-R and CIU-NR) appears to be independent of
oth the presence and the relative levels of these autontibodies. Among CIU subjects, both the basophil functional
henotypes and the IgG anti-FceRla and anti-lgE autoantijody levels remain stable in subjects with persistent disease.
Importantly, however, we noted a remarkable enhancement
in basophil function as subjects evolved into a state of
remission, which appears to be independent of the presence
of an autoantibody.
The observed shift in patterns of basophil histamine
release with remission suggests that abnormal basophil
function may be a primary feature of the pathogenesis
associated with urticaria. These shifts observed in our study
are consistent with the observation of Kern and Lichtenstein
(1976), who also reported a dramatic increase in basophil
responsiveness to anti-lgE in CIU patients who experienced
remission. Although the level of autoantibodies was the

highest in select subjects with extreme basopenia, the
measures of disease severity were not clearly elevated in
these subjects. These findings may point to a primary
abnormality in the basophil and/or unknown serological
‘actors affecting basophils in CIU patients as more relevant to
urticarial disease pathogenesis than the presence or level of
either FceRla- or IgE-reactive autoantibodies as measured by
IEMA.
Historically, IgG anti-FceRla and IgG anti-IgE antibodies
have been measured by ELISA or western blot analysis and
then compared with mediator release results from the HRA
assay. Although the HRA assay, in theory, can detect
“functional” autoantibodies that crosslink the IgE-FceRla
receptor complex, it depends on the unique characteristics of

the normal basophils that have been selected to perform the
assay (Grattan et al., 1991; Hide et al., 1993; Zweiman et al.,
1996; Kikuchi and Kaplan, 2001). In addition, this test has
been limited by the behavior of the basophils from the
various donors (MacGlashan, 1994; Zweiman et al., 1996)
and a general lack of universal standardized reagents to
permit reproducible and verifiable comparisons across
aboratories. Our empirical data indicate extensive variability
in the HRA assay (data not shown); therefore, we elected not
to use the HRA assay in the present analysis. Previous studies
have reported a poor correlation between the presence or
relative levels of IgG anti-FceRla, as measured by western
blot or ELISA, and the magnitude of histamine, as detected in
the HRA assay (Fiebiger et a/., 1998; Kikuchi and Kaplan,
2001; Soundararajan et al., 2005). We acknowledge that
“non-functional” autoantibodies may exist. However, the
western blot approach used in the largest study to date
(Kikuchi and Kaplan, 2001) may not have been sufficiently
sensitive to detect the lower concentrations of functional
antibodies in the sera of CIU subjects. In the western blot
study, the serum was diluted 1:500, in contrast to the 1:100
dilution required for the ELISAs of autoantibodies. This
higher-than-desired serum dilution may have prevented the
detection of potentially non-functional antibodies with low
avidity in non-ClU subjects. In addition, western blot
measurements of IgG anti-IgE were not performed in these
studies, which could explain some of the discrepancies that
exist between previous analyses and our present results.
Previous ELISAs reportedly detected autoantibodies regardless of the HRA result (Soundararajan et al., 2005). In another
study, an ELISA was unable to detect ‘functional’ autoantibodies in some subjects with a positive HRA (Fiebiger
et al., 1998). Neither study measured potentially functional,
naturally occurring IgG anti-IgE antibodies that we were able
to detect at similar frequencies in CIU and non-ClU
populations. Although our IEMA does not differentiate
between “functional” and ‘‘non-functional’” antibodies, we
maximized the analytical sensitivity of our assays for both IgG
anti-FceRla and IgG anti-lgE autoantibodies. However, we
have provided the IgE receptor function of blood basophils
obtained simultaneously with the serum sample analyzed for
autoantibodies to detect evidence of functional autoantibodies on a cell commonly used in the HRA.

Given the importance of precision and accuracy in
diagnostic tests, the ability to run many samples in a single
assay (in contrast to western blot analysis), and the inherent
problems with HRA, we decided to focus in this study on an
IEMA for the measurement of IgG anti-FceRla and IgG antiIgE in serum. The design of our IgG anti-FceRla assay is
similar to the assay used by Fiebiger et al. (1998), with several
important differences. First, we used a heterologous calibration curve that employed a humanized IgG anti-IgE antibody
(omalizumab) to estimate the amount of autoantibody in each
serum. This strategy contrasted with the use of the assay
response (optical density) by others (Fiebiger et al., 1998),
which is not always directly proportional to concentration.
Second, we defined a “positive” autoantibody presence on
the basis of the assay’s analytical sensitivity rather than a

response level detected in non-ClU subjects. Using a different
strategy for defining autoantibody-positive CIU subjects, we
detected a higher prevalence of FceRla-reactive autoantibodies in normal subjects. Moreover, using Fiebiger’s
“positive” criteria as the mean in non-ClU subjects plus 2.5
times the SEM, IgG anti-FceRla would still have remained
positive in 26% of our CIU subjects and 22% of our non-CIU
subjects. Using these same criteria, IgG anti-IgE would have
been positive in 7% of CIU subjects and 4% of non-ClU
subjects. Thus, using either strategy for defining autoantibody-positive subjects, both CIU and non-ClU groups had
similar frequencies of autoantibody positivity. An explanation
or the detection of autoantibodies in non-CIU subjects in our
study, in contrast to previously reported studies, may be a
consequence of our assay’s heightened analytical sensitivity
and our method of establishing the detection threshold based
on each assay’s actual analytical sensitivity rather than simply
using the levels of binding detected with sera from a non-ClU
population. However, other groups have reported naturally
occurring anti-lgE and anti-FceRla in non-CIU subjects
(Quinti et al., 1986; Fiebiger et al., 1998; Horn et al.,
1999). In addition, the autologous serum skin test, considered
to reflect the presence of functional anti-lgE and anti-FceRlo,
was positive in 35% of non-CIU subjects in one study
(Guttman-Yassky et al., 2007).

The limitations of our IEMA include the lack of a true
autoantibody standard for determining the precise amount of
antibody present. Nevertheless, a heterologous calibration
curve has been successfully used to calibrate other antibody
assays (Butler, 1991). Second, we did not measure the
subclass distribution of the IgG antibodies. It was originally
suggested by Fiebiger et al. (1998) that complement-activating IgG1 and IgG3 are present more frequently in CIU
subjects than in non-ClU subjects. This observation was later
supported by the lack of IgG2 antibodies in the sera of CIU
subjects but evidence for IgG4 autoantibodies in sera from
CIU subjects (Soundararajan et al., 2005). With no known
subclass-specific standard for the antibodies of interest and
different binding constants for the different subclass detection
antibodies, the accurate detection of these subclasses remains
challenging (Hamilton, 1987). Finally, because our assay
does not differentiate potentially functional from non-functional autoantibodies, it is possible that there are still
differences in the amount of functional antibodies between
CIU and non-ClU subjects.

In summary, these studies support the conclusion that
altered basophil IgE receptor function is a reproducible
finding in active CIU that appears to reflect disease remission.
This basophil functional abnormality appears to be independent of autoantibody presence as measured by IEMA and
suggests unknown serological factors or primary basophil
abnormalities in the pathogenesis of CIU.

Hybridoma Reagent Laboratory, Baltimore, MD) was added to
microtiter plates at 10 1g mI~' in PBS (pH 7.4) and used as a human
IgE capture reagent. Streptavidin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was
added to microtiter plates at 204g ml~' in PBS (pH 7.4) to capture
biotinylated human FceRla chain. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated murine monoclonal anti-human IgG Fe (clone HP6043;
Hamilton and Morrison, 1993; Hybridoma Reagent Laboratory)
was used at 1 gml~! as the human IgG detection protein.

A recombinant truncated form of the extracellular domain (amino
acids 1-172) of the a-chain of the high-affinity human IgE receptor
(FceRla; Heska Corporation, Fort Collins, CO) was produced in a
baculovirus expression system and biotinylated as described
previously (Stedman et al., 2001).

Polyclonal IgE (JK, Baltimore, MD; diluted to 2ugml-' in
PBS-BSA) was used as a source of human IgE.

 

Human specimens

After consent was obtained, whole blood for basophil and serology
studies was collected from subjects with a physician-determined
diagnosis of CIU (n= 73) as part of a longitudinal study (Gober et al.,
2006; Baker et al., in press) or from non-ClU, healthy control
subjects (9=23; 10 atopic and 13 non-atopic from history) using
protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board
(IRB) and the Western IRB and in adherence to the Declaration of
Helsinki Principles.

Basophil isolation and histamine release

Basophil studies were performed as described previously (Vonakis
et al., 2007). Briefly, venous blood was drawn into a syringe
containing 5-10mm EDTA. Mixed leukocytes were obtained using
dextran sedimentation with average basophil purity <1%. These
cells were stimulated for histamine release with polyclonal goat antihuman IgE (0.01-3pgml~') or N-formyl-met-leu-phe (FMLP;
Tpmol!~') for 45 minutes at 37°C. Histamine was quantified in
cell-free supernatant using an automated fluorometric assay
(Siraganian, 1975). Results were computed as the percentage of
total histamine release in a total cell lysate of leukocyte aliquots
after subtraction of the spontaneous histamine release.

CIU subjects were grouped on the basis of their ability to release
histamine after incubation of basophils with an optimal dose of antiIgE (0.1gml~') as described previously (Vonakis et al., 2007).
Subjects with histamine release <10% were classified as CIU-NR,
whereas subjects with histamine release >10% were classified as
CIU-R. Subjects with total (complete) histamine release <5ngml~'
were designated ClU-unclassified.

 

Human IgG anti-FeeRlo IEMA

Plate preparation. Streptavidin diluted in PBS was adsorbed
(0.1 ml per well) onto the bottom six rows of a sterile flat-bottom
polystyrene 96-well Bacti plate (Nalge-Nunc _ International,

JA Eckman et al.
Basophil Phenotypes and Autoantibodies in CIlU

Rochester, NY). Concurrent with the streptavidin-coating step, a
murine IgM anti-human IgE Fe (clone HP6061P diluted in PBS;
0.1 ml per well) was adsorbed onto the top two rows of each plate to
establish a calibration curve. The plates were incubated 16-18 hours
at 2-8 °C. This was followed by a buffer wash (PBS containing 0.05%
Tween 20 and 0.01% thimerosal (PBS-Tween)). Unreacted sites were
then blocked with PBS-BSA (0.3 ml per well) for 1 hour at 23°C.

Unknown and calibration serum preparation. |gE-depleted test
sera (diluted to 1:100 in PBS-BSA) were incubated for 3 hours at
37°C with biotinylated FceRla (final concentration 60ngml~!) or
PBS-BSA (sham control). For the calibration portion of the assay, 11
twofold dilutions of omalizumab were prepared with human IgG
anti-IgE Fe concentrations from 1ngml~! to 1 pgml-'.

Antibody binding and detection. The blocked plate was washed
five times with PBS-Tween and all wells in the top two calibration
rows with bound mouse anti-human IgE Fc received polyclonal
human IgE (2 pgml~! final IgE concentration, 0.1 ml per well). The
bottom wells containing streptavidin received 0.1 ml PBS-BSA. After
1h incubation, the whole plate was washed with PBS-Tween and the
IgE-depleted sera of test subjects (0.1 ml per well, wit!
biotin-FceRla) were added to their respective wells in the bottom of
the plate coated with streptavidin. The omalizumab (1 ngml~! to
1g ml~') was pipetted into replicate wells in the toy
portion of the plate. The entire plate was incubated for 1h at 23°C.

or without

calibration

Detection of bound human IgG. The entire plate was washed
five times with PBS-Tween and peroxidase-conjugated mouse antihuman IgG (HP6043-HRP, 1gml~', 0.1 ml per well) was added
to all wells. The plate was incubated for 1h at 23°C and then
washed five times in PBS-Tween. 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) substrate (0.1 ml per well), containing 1 ul of
H2O, per milliliter of ABTS, was pipetted into each well. After
60-75 minutes, the plate was read in an ELISA plate reader (MR4000;
Dynatech Technologies, McLean, VA) at 405nm. This calibration
curve constructed with omalizumab binding to insolubilized human
IgE was used to interpolate the level of IgG anti-FceRla in the test
sera. Reproducibility was confirmed with interassay coefficients of
variation <9% (n=8) of reference specimens analyzed on each
plate.

 

Competitive inhibition of anti-FceRlo assay

To confirm specificity, a competitive inhibition format of the IgG
anti-FceRla antibody IEMA was performed. Unlabeled soluble
FceRla (serial dilutions from 75 ng ml~! to 2.4 pg ml “') was added
to IgE-depleted sera containing IgG anti-FceRla. After an overnight
incubation at 4°C, the specimens were analyzed in the IgG antiFceRla antibody IEMA at a final concentration of 1:100 as discussed
above. Percentage inhibition of binding was computed.

Human IgG anti-IgE immunoenzymetric assay

Naturally occurring IgG anti-IgE in human sera was measured using
a solid-phase IEMA as discussed previously (Lichtenstein et al.,
1992). In brief, monoclonal murine IgM, anti-human IgE Fc in PBS
(clone HP6061P) was absorbed onto sterile flat-bottom polystyrene
96-well Bacti plates (0.1 ml per well; 16-18 hours at 2-8°C). The

plates were washed five times with PBS-Tween and subsequently
blocked with PBS-BSA (0.3 ml per well). Two hours later, the plates
were washed five times with PBS-Tween, and then polyclonal IgE
(2pgml-! final IgE concentration, 0.1 ml per well) was added to
each well. After a 1-hour incubation at 23°C, the plates were
washed five times with PBS-Tween and sera of the subjects (non-IgE
depleted) were added to the wells (0.1 ml per well, 1:100 final
dilution). HP6043-HRP (1 pg ml-!, 0.1 ml per well) was then added,
and the plates were incubated for 1h at 23°C. After an additional
buffer wash, ABTS substrate (0.1 ml per well), containing 1 ul of
H)O, per milliliter of ABTS, was added and processed as discussed
for the IgG anti-FceRla assay. Adsorbance at 280nm for the
unknown specimens was interpolated from the omalizumab heterologous calibration curve into estimates of IgG antibody bound as
described above. Reproducibility was demonstrated with interassay
coefficients of variation <20% (n=8) of reference curve dilutions
analyzed on each plate.

 

 

Minimal detectable concentration

The minimal detectable concentration of IgG anti-FceRla and IgG
anti-IgE antibodies was determined using a t-test to determine what
human IgG anti-IgE (omalizumab) concentration was significantly
different (>95% confidence) from the buffer blank (absence of
antibody). The minimum detectable concentration was determined
to be 200 ng mI" of IgG anti-human IgE. Values > 200 ngml~' were
considered to be significantly detectable, or ‘‘positive’’.

Statistical design

Two-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used for nonparametric analysis,
whereas two-tailed t-test was used for normally distributed data. A
P-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. All error bars
represent SEMs.
