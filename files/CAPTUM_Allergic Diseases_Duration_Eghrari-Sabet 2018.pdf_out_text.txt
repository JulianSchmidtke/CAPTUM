ABSTRACT

Background: Omalizumab was approved for the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU)/chronic spontaneous
urticaria (CSU) in the United States in March 2014.

Objective: This study sought to describe real-world omalizumab use, in the United States, in a large cohort of patients with
CIU/CSU.

Methods: Patients with CIU/CSU (ages =12 years) initiated on omalizumab (index date) with =12 months of pre- and
postindex data were identified in the an insurance claims data base (January 1, 2013, to July 31, 2016). Treatment patterns,
including the dosing regimen and continuous use of omalizumab (no gaps for =60 days), were described during the 12-month
postindex follow-up period.

Results: A total of 1546 patients (mean + standard deviation [SD] ages, 44 + 14.5 years; 73.1% women) were identified.
Most of the patients (84.5%) were initiated on omalizumab 300-mg dose; 90% maintained the initial dose, 7.5% had a dose
increase, and 4.6% had a dose decrease. The mean + SD omalizumab treatment duration was 9.1 + 3.8 months, the mean +
SD number of omalizumab administrations was 8.3 + 4.8, and the mean + SD administration frequency was 44 + 29 days.
A proportion of the patients continuously treated with omalizumab for 6, 9, and 12 months was 67.3, 54.8, and 47.4%,
respectively. Among the patients who discontinued omalizumab for =3 months (39.8%), 21% restarted the treatment after a
mean + SD of 4.4 + 1.3 months. The proportion of patients who used other CIU/CSU-related medications decreased pre- to
postindex (94.8 to 81.1%), with the highest decrease observed in oral corticosteroids (75.7 to 49.9%).

Conclusion: In this large real-world study, the majority of the patients with CIU/CSU were initiated on a 300-mg
omalizumab dose and treated without titration up or down for 9 months on average. Most of the patients were continuously
treated with omalizumab for =6 months, and one-fourth of the patients who discontinued treatment resumed it. Moreover,
compared with baseline levels, the use of other CIU/CSU-related medications was lower after omalizumab initiation, with the
most prominent decrease observed in oral corticosteroids.

Clinical trials demonstrated safety and efficacy of
omalizumab in CIU/CSU’®; however, the information
on practical aspects of omalizumab use, including
treatment duration, dosage, and dose change, is still
limited in the United States. A number of international
studies investigated experiences with omalizumab in a
real-world setting, but these studies were small (=110
patients), and some studies included off-label use of
omalizumab.'°-™* A few early U.S. real-world studies
of omalizumab in CIU/CSU had a sample size of <300
patients.'*?° To the best of our knowledge, this study
was among the first to describe characteristics and
treatment patterns in a large sample of patients with
CIU/CSU initiated on omalizumab in a real-life setting
in the United States.

METHODS

Data Source

The Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims
and Encounters and the Medicare Supplemental and
Coordination of Benefits data bases (January 1, 2013, to
July 31, 2016) were used. Available data included patient demographics, medical, and prescription drug
claims. The data bases cover all U.S. Census regions
with a concentration in the South and North Central
(Midwest) regions, and allow creation of a nationally
representative data sample of Americans with employerprovided health insurance. The data bases are fully
compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act; therefore, no ethics review was
necessary.

Study Design

In this retrospective descriptive study, the index date
was defined as the date of omalizumab initiation. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics as well
as the use of preomalizumab CIU/CSU-related medications were reported during the baseline period, defined as the 12 months before the index date. Treatment patterns were analyzed during the follow-up
period, which spanned from the index date until the
end of data availability for a minimum of 12 months.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted in patients with
218 and 24 months of follow-up.

To be included in the study, the patients were required to have CIU/CSU identified based on the validated algorithm’: two or more independent claims
with a diagnosis for idiopathic (the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
[ICD-9-CM] code 708.1x; the International Classification
of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-10CM] code L50.1xx), other (ICD-9-CM code 708.8x; ICD10-CM code L50.8xx), or unspecified urticaria (ICD9-CM code 708.9x; ICD-10-CM code L50.9xx) =6 weeks
apart or one or more claims with a diagnosis for idio
192

pathic, other, or unspecified urticaria; and one or more
claims with a diagnosis for angioedema (ICD-9-CM
code 995.1x; ICD-10-CM code T78.3) =6 weeks apart. In
addition, the patients were required to have one or
more pharmacy or medical claims of omalizumab, with
the first claim being after March 21, 2014. The patients
without 12 months of continuous health plan eligibility
before and after the index date and those <12 years old
at the index date were excluded from the study.

Outcome Measures

The baseline use of CIU/CSU-related medications
(i.e., oral corticosteroids [OCS], H,- and H,-antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists [LTRA], antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive agents, and antidepressants) was defined as one or more prescription
fills of such medication. The number of prescription

Continuous Use of Omalizumab

The proportion of the patients who used omalizumab continuously for 6, 9, and 12 months was re
ported. Continuous omalizumab use was defined as an
absence of a gap (i.e., 30, 60, and 90 days) between
consecutive days of omalizumab supply or between
the last day of omalizumab supply and the end of the
follow-up period.

Statistical Analysis

Patient characteristics and treatment patterns were
described by using mean + SD, median, first and third
quartiles, and interquartile range for continuous variables and frequencies and proportions for categorical
variables. All statistical analyses were conducted by
using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).

RESULTS

Patient Characteristics

A total of 91,996 patients with CIU/CSU were identified, among whom 4582 were initiated on omalizumab after March 21, 2014, and 1546 met the remaining selection criteria (Fig. 1). The sample covered all
U.S. Census regions, with 44.4% of the patients from
the South, 19.9% from the North Central, 18.2% from
the North East, and 17.2% from the West region (Table
1). The mean + SD duration of the follow-up period
was 612 + 151 days; 946 patients (61.2%) had =18
months of follow-up, and 447 (28.9%) had =24 months
of follow-up. The majority of the patients with =18 and
24 months of follow-up were initiated on omalizumab
early in 2014. The patients had a mean + SD age of
44 + 145 years and were predominately women
(73.1%). During the baseline period, 32.7% of the patients had one or more diagnoses of angioedema, and
the top three CIU/CSU-related conditions included allergic rhinitis (50.4%), asthma (31.8%), and food and other
allergies (21.2%) (diagnostic codes to identify comorbidities are provided in Supplemental Appendix 1). The top

195
three mental comorbidities included anxiety, depressive, and sleep-wake disorders with a prevalence of
13.1, 12.8, and 11.7%, respectively. The majority of
patients (80.5%) had one or more visits to an allergist or
immunologist, and 38.7% had one or more visits to a
dermatologist.

During the baseline period, the majority of patients
(75.7%) used an OCS, with the mean + SD number of

of the patients (52.5%) used an LTRA, predominantly
montelukast (51.5%), with the mean + SD number of
fills being 1.9 + 2.8. Only prescribed H,-antihistamines
were captured in the data, with the use as following:
47.0% used first-generation H,-antihistamines (mean +
SD, 1.5 + 2.7 fills), 32.4% used H,-antihistamines
(mean + SD, 1.1 + 2.2 fills), and 23.7% used secondgeneration H,-antihistamines (mean + SD, 0.9 + 2.2
fills). The baseline use of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents that indicate refractory CIU/
CSU was relatively low, at 12.7 and 10.0%, respectively. Close to half of the patients (44.8%) filled one or
more prescriptions (mean + SD, 2.8 + 4.7) for an antidepressant, including doxepin. Also, when classifying patients according to the highest step in the U.S. step-care
approach to CIU/ CSU, most patients (39.7%) received
treatment according to step 3 (i.e., hydroxyzine or doxepin) protocol, which precedes initiation of treatment

Omalizumab Dosing Regimen

Most patients (84.5%) were initiated on a 300-mg
dose of omalizumab. The index dose of 300 mg was
slightly less common in patients initiated on omalizumab in 2014 (80.0%) compared with 2015 (92.3%)
(Fig. 2) and in patients with longer follow-up. Most
patients (90.0%) were maintained on their index dose,
7.5% had a dose increase, and 4.6% had a dose decrease. Among the patients with a dose increase, 39.5%
increased to 300 mg and the rest increased to higher
doses. Dose increases were more frequent in patients
initiated on omalizumab in the first year of its approval
(8.0% in 2014 versus 6.6% in 2015). The duration of treatment with omalizumab (mean + SD, 273 + 113 days),
number of omalizumab administrations (mean + SD,
8.3 + 4.8) and frequency of administrations (mean + SD,
44 + 29 days) were similar among the patients initiated
on 150- and 300-mg doses of omalizumab (Table 3). The
patients with =18 and 24 months of follow-up had a

treated up to 12 months. Similar trends were observed
when using different gap length (i.e., 30 and 90 days)
(Fig. 3) and in the patients with =18 and 24 months of
follow-up.

Concomitant Use with Other CIU/CSU-Related
Medications at the Index Date and Treatment
Changes Associated with Omalizumab

At the index date, 56.5% of patients received one or
more other medication with omalizumab (Table 4). The
most common combination was with an LTRA (27.8%),
followed by an antidepressant (25.9%). The percentages of the patients who used prescription H,- and
H,-antihistamines concomitantly with omalizumab
were 21.0 and 14.2%, respectively. Over the follow-up
period, 39.8% of the patients discontinued omalizumab
for =3 months with the mean + SD time to discontinuation being 131 + 76 days. Among those who discontinued, 54% switched to another CIU/CSU-related
medication (most commonly, to a prescription H,-antihistamine), and 21.0% subsequently restarted treatment with omalizumab. An add-on to omalizumab
was observed in 34.2% of the patients, with an OCS
being the most common medication added (37.7%),
followed by a prescription H,-antihistamine (25.2%).
Among the patients with =18 and 24 months of follow

up, higher proportions discontinued omalizumab (50.1
and 53.2%, respectively) and subsequently resumed it
(29.1 and 39.5%, respectively).

Use of Other CIU/CSU-Related Medications During
the Follow-up Period

Initiation of omalizumab was associated with a decreased use of other CIU/CSU-related medications:
94.8% of the patients had one or more fills of such medication during the baseline period versus 84.6% during
the follow-up period (Fig. 4). This decrease occurred
across all medications, with the most prominent observed
in OCS (75.7% during the baseline versus 49.9% during
the follow-up). Furthermore, the use of medications was
consistently decreasing during the follow-up period,
from 72.8% over the first 3 months to 58.5% over the last
3 months. This trend was observed in all medications
with the exception of antidepressants, the use of which
remained constant but at a lower level compared with the
baseline period.

DISCUSSION

Our study described characteristics and treatment
patterns of a large sample of U.S. patients with CIU/
CSU initiated on omalizumab in a clinical setting. Patients from all U.S. Census regions were included in the
study, and the results were generalizable to the commercially insured U.S. population. Patient demographic char

angioedema, which can be considered an unfavorable
prognostic factor, was lower in our study (32.7%) compared with a range of 38-54% in trials.”° Preomalizumab use of immunosuppressive agents was similar
to that in the GLACIAL trial.” The patients in our study

omalizumab with a 150-mg dose.'’%"4 In our study,
more patients were initiated on a 300-mg dose in the
second versus the first year after approval of omalizumab, a change in prescribing practice that could be
related to publications that show improved efficacy of
omalizumab in CIU/CSU when administered as a
300-mg dose.'* Among the patients with a dose increase,
60.5% increased the dose to >300 mg. This finding
should be interpreted with caution because the number
of patients to increase the dose to >300 mg was small
(n = 46). Moreover, the majority initiated omalizumab
shortly after its approval (in 2014, n = 29), and such dose
increases could be due to limited clinical experience with
the drug. Of note, one clinical trial examined the use of
the 600 mg of omalizumab but did not find it to be more
effective than the 300-mg dose.’

reported a possibility of symptom reoccurrence once
omalizumab is discontinued, which could be one of the
reasons to restart omalizumab. Reasons for omalizumab
discontinuation and restarting were not available in the
claims data; however, another study reported the lack of
time for treatment, insurance disenrollment, and symptom resolution among the top reasons for omalizumab
discontinuation that might lead to a subsequent restart of
omalizumab.!°

The use of other CIU/CSU-related medications in
our study decreased after omalizumab initiation compared with baseline levels. A numerical decrease of 25
percentage points in the proportion of patients who
used OCS exceeded that reported in a recent realworld study.’ This was an important finding given an
increased risk of adverse effects reported in patients

another real-world study.'?

Study Limitations

This study was subject to a number of limitations. Only
prescription H,-antihistamines are captured in pharmacy
claims, and, because H,-antihistamines could be obtained
over the counter, the current study likely underreported
heir use. The dose of omalizumab injections adminisered in a medical setting cannot be identified in claims
data, hence, only patients with one or more pharmacy
claims were considered for the analysis of the omalizumab dosing regimen. A pharmacy claim corresponds
‘o an order of the drug and provides an approximation
on the actual dose and frequency of the drug administration; moreover, a pharmacy claim does not guarantee that
he medication was taken, which potentially led to overestimation of medication use. Of note, omalizumab use
was described based on both pharmacy claims and medical claims for injections, the latter served as a guarantee
hat the medication was administered. Also, administrative claims data might have inherent limitations, such as
potential miscoding or may contain inaccurate or missing
data on prescriptions, procedures, and diagnoses.

 

CONCLUSION

In this large real-world study of patients with CIU/
CSU who were treated with omalizumab, the majority
were initiated on a 300-mg dose and received the medication for an average of 9 months without dose titration
up or down. Most of the patients were continuously
treated with omalizumab for =6 months. Among patients who discontinued omalizumab for =3 months,
one-fourth resumed it. The discontinuation and restart
rates were higher in the patients with longer follow-up.
The use of CIU/CSU-related medications decreased after
omalizumab initiation compared with baseline levels and
displayed a declining trend during the follow-up period.
