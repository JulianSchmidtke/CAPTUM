ABSTRACT

Background: Measurement of disease activity guides treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria
(CSU). A weekly Urticaria Activity Score—here, the average of twice-daily patient assessment of itch
and hives scores summed over 1 week (UAS71p)—measures severity from 0 to 42. Insufficient
evidence exists whether disease activity states, defined by categorical UAS7;p scores, correlate with

other patient-reported outcomes and treatment response.

Objective: To evaluate and compare categorical UAS7;p scores with selected measures of disease
related quality of life and impact.

Methods: Data from three randomised clinical trials of omalizumab in CSU were pooled. Continuous
UAS7 p scores were categorised into five disease activity states: urticaria-free, well-controlled, mild,
moderate, and severe urticaria. Total scores from the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI); the
Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life questionnaire (CU-Q,0L); and questions on sleep and daily activity
interference, presence of angioedema, and diphenhydramine use were compared within categorised
UAS7 ;p disease-state scores, using one-way analyses of variance for analysis at different time points

and mixed-effects regressions for analysis of all data pooled.

Results: Pooled analyses showed that categorical UAS7;p disease states accurately predicted
differences among treated CSU patients with different levels of disease activity. A consistent pattern
existed between categories, with higher-activity disease states associated with significantly higher
impact and an increase in angioedema frequency. Results at different treatment time points were

consistent.

Conclusion: Categorical UAS71p disease states can discriminate between measures when considering
the impact of urticaria activity. Using five categorical disease states could simplify clinical assessment

and monitoring of treatment efficacy.

KEY WORDS

Chronic urticaria, disease states, clinical assessment, health-related quality of life

INTRODUCTION

Chronic spontaneous (also known as idiopathic) urticaria (CSU) is defined as the occurrence of itchy
wheals/hives, angioedema, or both for more than 6 weeks with or without known causes.’ CSU is
known to have a substantial impact on the patient’s quality of life (QoL), including effects on daily
living activities and work productivity, and by causing sleep disturbance, loss of energy, and

emotional problems.”?

Various types of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures are used to assess CSU disease activity
and its impact on daily activities and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).’ CSU activity is assessed
based on the occurrence of signs (wheals/hives) and symptoms (pruritus/itch). Since the appearance
of hives and the intensity of itch can change on a daily basis, assessment of both is best performed
by patients with the daily Urticaria Activity Score (UAS), summed to a weekly score (UAS7).°® In
addition, the impact of CSU on HRQoL can be measured with dermatological-specific measures such
as Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)’ and the urticaria-specific Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life

Questionnaire (CU-Q,oL).®

The UAS is recommended for routine clinical practice, however, it may be challenging to compare
patients in terms of their disease activity using the UAS’s continuous scoring. It could be informative
to know whether grouping the continuous score of the UAS7 into a smaller number of categories
that would reflect different levels of CSU activity, or disease states, could discriminate among CSU
patients with different levels of disease activity. Specifically, there is insufficient evidence as to
whether disease states defined by categorical UAS7 scores correlate with CSU disease activity and

response to treatment. If categorical UAS7 disease states could be shown to be informative as to the

impact of disease on patients’ life, QoL, and response to treatment, they could be an efficient tool
for clinical practice. The purpose of this initial validation of these CSU activity categories was to
describe categorical UAS7 scores in terms of DLQI and CU-Q,0L scores, as well as selected measures
of disease activity and impact, and to assess whether a clear significant discrimination exists

between the categories.

METHODS

Data

Data for the analysis came from three randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 global
clinical trials (ASTERIA I,° N = 319; ASTERIA II,"° N = 323; and GLACIAL," N = 336) evaluating the effect
of omalizumab on symptoms of patients with inadequately controlled CSU. Figure 1 presents the
treatment and follow-up periods of the trials, as well as the dosing regimens and timing of the PRO

°° trials received licensed dose of

data collection for the three trials. Patients in ASTERIA I° and |
second-generation H, antihistamines as background therapy, whereas patients recruited into the
GLACIAL study” received second-generation H, antihistamines (up to four times the licensed dose),
H, blockers, and/or leukotriene receptor antagonists. Treatment was administered once every 4
weeks for 24 weeks in ASTERIA |? and GLACIAL” and for 12 weeks in ASTERIA Il.”° All three trials had

a follow-up period with no active treatment of 16 weeks. The studies conformed to the Declaration

of Helsinki.’? All studies were ethically approved and all patients gave informed consent.

Measures

Three primary PRO measures, capturing signs and symptoms, dermatologic QoL, and disease-specific
QoL, were used to obtain information on patients’ experiences with CSU in the clinical trials: the
twice-daily version of the Urticaria Activity Score over 7 days (UAS77p)° as part of the Urticaria

Patient Daily Diary (UPDD),”* the DLQI,”"* and the CU-Q,oL.®

UPDD

The validated UPDD” contains the UAS assessed every 12 hours and daily activity interference, sleep
interference, and presence of angioedema, all of which are assessed every 24 hours, as well as the

use of rescue medication.

UAS7,p Score

In the UAS7;p version, patients record the morning and evening itch severity score (ISS) and hives
scores. ISS is assessed each time as 0 = no itch, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe, and the
number of hives are assessed as 0 = none, 1 = 1-6 hives; 2 = 7-12 hives, and 3 = > 12 hives. A daily
UAS score is obtained from the sum of the average daily ISS and average daily hives score. The
weekly UAS7;p score is obtained by summing the daily UAS scores over 7 days. Scores were reported
at baseline and every 4 weeks until week 40 for ASTERIA |? and GLACIAL” and until week 28 for

ASTERIA Il."°

The UAS7;p score ranges from 0 to 42, with higher scores reflecting higher activity.® Scores were
categorised into five disease states: urticaria-free (UAS71p = 0), well-controlled urticaria (UAS7+p = 16), mild activity urticaria (UAS77p = 7-15), moderate activity urticaria (UAS7;p = 16-27), and severe
activity urticaria (UAS71p = 28-42).’° Two of these disease states (urticaria-free and well-controlled
urticaria) were predefined endpoints for the clinical trials. Patients had to have a UAS7;p score of 16
or higher to be included in the trials, so 16 was considered the lower threshold for the moderate
disease state. In addition, a score of 28 and above was considered severely-active disease.*° The
remaining UAS7;p scores (7-15) were used to define a mild urticaria disease state. All categorical

ranges of scores were developed with expert input.’*””

Additional Questions in the UPDD

Several additional questions collected in the UPDD were included to make comparisons among the
UAS7;p disease states. In the diary, patients were asked to rate how much their hives and itch
interfered with sleep and with daily activities during the previous 24 hours (0 = no interference;

1 = mild, little interference; 2 = moderate, some interference; and 3 = substantial, severe
interference). Patients were asked whether they had used antihistaminic rescue medications
(number of diphenhydramine [DPH] 25-mg pills) during the previous 24 hours to control symptoms
of their skin condition, such as hives or itch (0-3 pills). Finally, patients were asked about the
presence of angioedema (yes or no) in the previous 24 hours. For the sleep, daily activities, and
medication items, the mean of the sum of the daily scores for the 7 days prior to the study visit of
interest was calculated (range: 0-21, with higher score indicating higher impact). For the presence of
angioedema, patients were categorised as “yes” if they responded yes to the angioedema question
on any of the 7 days prior to the visit of interest. The weekly mean scores on all items were used as
comparison variables to test whether different UAS7;p disease states were characterised by different

mean scores on these parameters’ comparison variables.

DLQI

The DLQI’ has a total score that ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores reflecting worse HRQoL. The
recall period for the DLQI is 1 week. DLQI data were collected at baseline and weeks 4, 12, 24, and
40 for ASTERIA |? and GLACIAL" and at baseline and weeks 4, 12, and 28 for ASTERIA Il.”° The DLQI
has been validated for use in patients with CSU.”"*"* Validated score ranges exist for the DLQI to
explain the impact on dermatologic-related QoL: no effect: 0-1; small effect: 2-5; moderate effect: 6
10; very large effect: 11-20; extremely large effect: 21-30.”

CU-Q2oL

The CU-Q;0L is a disease-specific, 23-item PRO measure designed to assess HRQoOL in patients with
csu.*”° The recall period is 2 weeks. Patients are asked how bothered they have been by each
symptom in the previous 2 weeks. Each item is assessed on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (never) to
5 (very much). The total score is transformed to range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating
worse HRQoL. CU-Q,oL data were collected at baseline and weeks 4, 12, 24, and 40 for ASTERIA I°

and GLACIAL" and at baseline and weeks 4, 12, and 28 for ASTERIA II.’°

Data Analyses

Exploratory Analyses of Individual Trials at Different Time Points

Initial analyses of data, by individual trial at different time points, were performed by simple
descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, proportions) for each of the measures detailed in
the previous section. These analyses were conducted using available data at each time point, since
they were exploratory in nature and the results were specific point estimates (e.g., means,
proportions). The results of these analyses indicated a pattern: as UAS71p disease-state activity
increased, the scores on the comparator variables, such as the DLQI and CU-Q;0L, became worse
(Tables SI-1-SI-4). In addition, cross-tabulations of the UAS7;p disease states with the DLQI response
categories, as well as with changes in DLQI effect sizes, were conducted and significance testing
conducted with Pearson y’ (Tables SI-5 to SI-13). The means of continuous UAS7;p scores for each
DLQI effect size then were examined using one-way analyses of variance with Bonferroni correction
for multiple pairwise comparisons to see if adjacent DLQI effect sizes had significantly different mean
UAS7+ scores (Tables SI-14 to SI-17). The number of patients in each subgroup was insufficient to
provide robust summary statistics; however, because the patient population (Table 1) and study

design (Fig. 1) were similar; data were pooled to increase sample size.

Pooled Data Analyses

Comparison of UAS7;p Disease States on Comparator Variables at Different Time Points

Trial data were pooled (all trials, all treatment arms) and assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, and end of
study (week 40 for ASTERIA I? and GLACIAL" and week 28 for ASTERIA II"°). UAS71p disease states
were compared on the following measures: DLQI total score; CU-Q,oL total score; sleep interference,
activity interference, number of DPH pills, and the proportion of patients with angioedema in the
previous 7 days. At 12 weeks, comparison of the proportion of angioedema-free days from weeks 4

through 12 also was assessed.

Mean scores of selected comparator variables for adjacent UAS7;p disease states were compared
using one-way analyses of variance. Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons helped guard
against significant differences in mean scores for each comparator variable between UAS7;p disease
states arising due to chance. To add to our conservative approach, comparisons for statistically
significant differences were limited to adjacent disease states only, such that patients who were in
the urticaria-free disease state (UAS77p = 0) were compared with those in the well-controlled
urticaria disease state (UAS71p = 1-6); those in the well-controlled urticaria disease state (UAS77p = 1
6) were compared with those in the mild urticaria disease state (UAS71p = 7-15), and so forth.

Prediction of Outcomes by UAS7;p Disease States

A second set of analyses was conducted in which all trials, all treatment arms, and all time points
were pooled. The data were analysed using mixed-effects regressions models (linear mixed models
across multiple time points with fixed effects for baseline covariates) to predict selected outcomes
by UAS7;p disease states. UAS7;p disease states were used to predict, separately, the DLQI total
score, the CU-Q;0L total score, sleep interference, activity interference, the number of DPH pills, and
the number of days with angioedema. Trial and treatment arm were included in the models as fixed

effects. Covariates included gender, age, and duration of disease. The health state of “urticaria-free”

(i.e., UAS7;p=0) was used as the reference category for each initial mixed-effects regression model
predicting the selected outcome. Each analysis then used these regression estimates to calculate the
marginal mean scores and standard errors for the selected outcome, for each UAS71p disease state,

adjusted for the covariates in the model.

For exploratory descriptive analyses, observed data were used. Predictive analyses were conducted
on two datasets: first using the pooled trials datasets in which missing data were accounted for by
applying multiple imputation method and secondly on the observed data, under the assumption that
the missing data mechanism was missing at random. P-values of 0.05 or below were considered
significant. All analyses were conducted using Stata (version 13.0 or higher; StataCorp, College

Station, Texas).

RESULTS

Baseline Characteristics

A total of 975 patients were available for analysis; 318 in ASTERIA I, 322 in ASTERIA II, and 335 in
GLACIAL. The demographic and baseline characteristics of the study population are shown in Table
1. The majority (72%-76%) were female, with a median age ranging from 41 to 44 years and a mean
disease duration of approximately 7 years. The populations across the three trials were similar, with
no significant differences found, except a greater proportion of patients presenting with baseline

angioedema in GLACIAL" versus ASTERIA II."°

Categorical UAS77p Disease States Distinguish Patients With Different

QoL Impairments

Pooled trial analyses confirmed that categorical UAS7;p disease states can accurately predict
differences in QoL impairment. When all trials, all treatment arms, and all time points were pooled,

the differences between each adjacent disease state were highly significant (P < 0.001) in the DLQI

and CU-Q,0L total scores (Fig. 2A and B; Table SI-18 in Supporting Information), with a 50% to 100%
increase in HRQoL scores between improving UAS7;p disease states. We found similar results by
pooled trial analyses at different time points, particularly after 12 weeks of treatment and at the
study-end assessment, i.e., 16 weeks following end of treatment (Table SI-19 in Supporting
Information). A consistent pattern was revealed: the greater the disease activity, the higher the

impact on HRQoL, and this impact is independent of type and duration of treatment.

Categorical UAS7;p Disease States Are Associated With Disease Impact

on Daily Activities and Sleep

The impact of disease activity on daily activities and interference with sleep was significantly
different for each category band of UAS7;p disease states and doubled consistently between each
subsequent increase in disease activity (Fig. 3A and B; Table SI-18 in Supporting Information). These
differences were also consistently significant at different time points in treatment (Table SI-19 in
Supporting Information), indicating that control of CSU activity allows patients to carry out their

normal daily activities without sleep deprivation.

Categorical UAS77p Disease States Reflect Use of On-Demand

Antihistamine Medication

The use of DPH rescue medication increased significantly as the categorical UAS71p disease activity
increased (Fig. 4; Table SI-18 in Supporting Information). Patients in the severe urticaria score band
(UAS77p = 28-42) required four times the number of DPH pills as those patients with well-controlled
or no urticaria (UAS7;7p < 6). These results again were seen at different time points (Table SI-19 in
Supporting Information); however, significance was not consistent, particularly between the lower
activity disease states.

Higher UAS7;7p Disease States Are Linked to Higher Prevalence Rates of

Reported Angioedema

The pooled trial analyses showed that the higher categorical disease activity states are generally
associated with significantly higher rates of reported days with angioedema when looking at data
pooled across trials, time points, and all patients. These rates rise noticeably with a UAS7;p score
greater than 15 (Fig. 5; Table SI-18 in Supporting Information). At different time points (e.g., weeks
12 and 40), the pattern of increased rates of angioedema in higher categorical disease activity states

also was seen, but most differences were non-significant (Table SI-19 in Supporting Information).

Results using observed data are similar, both with all data pooled (Table SI-20 in Supporting

Information) and at different time points (Table SI-21 in Supporting Information).

DISCUSSION

This study assessed whether patients with different categorical UAS7;p scores, reflecting different
levels of CSU activity, have significantly different levels of HRQoL impairment, interference with daily
activities and sleep, use of on-demand medications, and prevalence of angioedema. Our findings
indicated that this is the case: patients with different categorical UAS7;p have significantly different
disease impacts on their daily lives. Thus, these five UAS7;p disease states can significantly
differentiate CSU patients in terms of the effects that CSU has on their lives. . Patients with lower
UAS7 7p categories have better-controlled CSU, less angioedema, significantly better QoL, and
experience less interference with daily activities and sleep. These analyses also showed that,
irrespective of the treatment a patient receives, a patient with a specific disease activity, as
measured by the five categorical UAS71p disease states, will have a particular HRQoL and that this

HRQoL will be significantly different from that of a patient with another disease activity state.

The results of the pooled analyses, where mixed-effects regressions were performed for all patients,

all treatment arms, and all time points, showed a consistent pattern: comparison variable scores
were statistically significantly better (P < 0.05) for each improved UAS7;p disease state, with the

majority of the tests significant at P < 0.001.

Previous analyses have shown a near-perfect correlation between changes in signs and symptoms of
CSU, as measured by the UAS7yp, and changes in the DLQI and CU-Q,oL over the same time period.”*
These analyses provide further evidence of strength of these relationships, even when assessed in

categorical activity states.

This first empirical look at disease states in CSU measured by itch and hives also provided new
evidence that angioedema should be considered when analysing CSU patients’ experiences and that
angioedema increases with increased disease activity, particularly moderate to severe CSU activity.
Because there was concern that comparisons among multiple UAS7yp disease states on multiple
comparator variables would result in multiplicity and yield significant differences among disease
states simply by chance, a limited number of selected variables were used for statistical
comparisons, and only comparisons on the effects of urticaria between adjacent disease states were
conducted. Mean scores on comparator variables were consistently worse for increasingly worse
health states. Significance tests demonstrated the extent to which UAS71p disease states were
statistically different on these selected variables and added confidence to the hypothesis that the

UAS71p disease states can discriminate among patients in terms of their urticaria activity.

Perhaps the main limitation of this study is in regards to the analyses at specific time points. With
the exception of robust results at week 12, not all differences at other time points were statistically
significant, most likely due to small sample sizes. However, when all data were pooled, consistent
and significant differences were seen. Further analyses, including sensitivity analyses using bands
based on different UAS77p scores and alternative anchor tools, such as visual analogue scores, to

evaluate itch’ would lend additional support to these UAS71p disease states.

As noted earlier, the exploratory analyses made no adjustment for missing data. This was done
intentionally, as using only available data allowed comparison of actual observed patient
experiences by UAS7;p health states. For the predictive models using mixed-effects regressions,
analyses were performed two ways: multiple imputation for missing data and using only available,
observed data. Results were very similar and conclusions were the same in either case. The main
difference in results was that there were more significant differences using the multiply imputed
data. This is not surprising given the larger sample size that resulted from imputing data. Thus, as
expected, using only available data is a more conservative approach which supports the UAS71p

health states’ ability to discriminate between patient experiences with urticaria.

One potential consideration of relevance to this research relates to the instruments used in
measuring CSU. Some aspects of the psychometric properties of the DLQI (e.g., dimensionality and
differential item function) have been criticised”; however, the DLQI has been validated for use in
csu**?5 and a minimally important difference has been determined.’®”° The CU-Q,0L, a relatively
recent addition to the study of HRQoL in CSU, is recommended as the disease-specific assessment
tool by the international guidelines.” These disease states were obtained using the UAS77p. However,
international guidelines’ also have a preference for use of a once-daily (UAS7op) version of UAS. The
UAS7op° differs from the UAS7;,° in that the itch and hive assessment is conducted once every 24
hours and in the number of hives included in the daily hive score. The daily itch and hives score
ranges are the same (0-3) in both versions, as are the scoring and weekly ranges (0-42) (Table SI-20
in Supporting Information), but differ in the number of 24-hour hives that compose the same daily
hives score. Further studies examining the equivalency of the UAS7; scores with scores obtained

with UAS7 op are ongoing.

Overall, our results suggested that categorising continuous UAS7;p scores ranges into categorical
UAS7;p disease states can discriminate between different levels of urticaria activity. Different levels

of disease activity correlated with PROs. A pattern of greater consistently significant impact on

HRQOL, daily activities, sleep, and use of on-demand antihistamine treatment was seen with each
higher UAS7;p category. Reducing the continuous UAS7;p score from 42 points to five categorical
disease states, much like the DLQI scoring bands,*® could simplify clinical assessment and facilitate

evaluation of treatment efficacy. Further research and analyses of these correlations is warranted.
