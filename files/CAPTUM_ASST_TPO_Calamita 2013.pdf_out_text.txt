Abstract: Background: Understanding the etiopathogenesis of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) remains a challenge.
The clinical and laboratory characteristics relating to its histocompatibility profile and autoimmunity are constant research
topics.

Objectives: To analyze the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with CSU by means of a cross-sectional
study, focusing on the histocompatibility profile, presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and presence of
antithyroperoxidase antibodies (anti-TPO).

Materials & Methods: Sixty-seven adults with CSU were analyzed. The autologous serum skin test (ASST), ANA and
anti-TPO were performed in all cases and MHC classes I and II (loci A, B and DR) were evaluated in 49 patients.

Results: The factors that worsened urticaria included use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, emotional stress and
physical stimuli, reported by 27%, 16% and 15% of these patients, respectively. The ASST test was positive in 49 patients
(73%) and anti-TPO and ANA were present in 15 (22.4%) and 7 (10.5%), respectively. The OR (with 95% CI) for the
association between ANA and anti-TPO was 5.94 (1.16-30.42), and thus statistically significant. There was a favorable
association (with statistical significance) between HLA B*50 and patients with CSU, with OR (95% CI) of 2.96 (1.177.48).

Conclusion: A significant favorable association was found between these patients and HLA B*50, and between the
presence of anti-TPO and ANA. The greater prevalence of HLA B*50 in these patients and the association between ANA

and anti-TPO reinforce the possibility that an immunogenic mechanism may be the triggering factor for CSU.

Keywords: Autoimmune disease, ANA, anti-TPO, autoantibodies, chronic urticaria, histocompatibility, HLA, MHC.

INTRODUCTION

Recurrent chronic urticaria is still a challenge for physicians,
in relation to both the etiological diagnosis and the treatment.
This is a clinical condition that affects the skin and is
characterized by formation of erythematous papules that are
often pruriginous, occurring singly or in groups, and generally
of fleeting and recurrent nature. These lesions result from
vasodilatation and edema of the dermis, and when they affect
the deeper regions of the skin (subcutaneous tissue and sub
mucosa), they are termed angioedema, and are manifested
through swelling, especially of the face. Urticaria and
angioedema are common illnesses that affect between 12 and
22% of all individuals at some stage of life [1].

Urticaria is classified as acute or chronic according to the
duration of the symptoms. In the acute form, the symptoms
do not last for more than six weeks, while cases are
classified as chronic if they persist for longer times [1-4].
Chronic urticaria has worldwide prevalence ranging from
0.27% to 2.1% [1].

Cases are described as idiopathic chronic urticaria if they
present chronic nature but the cause remains obscure despite

clinical and laboratory investigations. The most recently
accepted term for such cases is chronic spontaneous urticaria
(CSU) [3, 4]. Currently, it is considered that around 40% of
“idiopathic” spontaneous urticaria cases are of autoimmune
etiology, consequent to the action of immunoglobulin G
(IgG) autoantibodies directed against high-affinity IgE
receptors (FceRI) of cutaneous mast cells, or against IgE
bonded to mast cells [5-11]. These autoantibodies
predominantly have complement fixation properties in
relation to subclasses IgG1 and IgG3 [9-11].

The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is formed
by polymorphic glycoprotein molecules that are expressed
on the surface of all the nucleated cells (HLA class I) and on
the main cells involved in the immune response (HLA class
Il). The genetic locus involved in expression of HLA
molecules is known as the major histocompatibility complex
(MHC). The HLA molecules serve as “self” markers during
the maturation of the thymus, which allows the
immunological system to recognize antigens that are foreign
to the organism, within the context of “self’ HLA molecules.
This system is directly involved in various aspects of the
immune-mediated mechanisms, among which the following
deserve to be highlighted: the organism’s defensive response
against external infectious aggressors, the graft rejection
process and the triggering of autoimmune diseases. Many
autoimmune diseases are associated with specific alleles of

the HLA system [12], but few studies in the literature deal
with this issue in relation to chronic urticaria [13-20].

With regard to the issue of autoimmunity, another very
interesting aspect is the possible connection between CSU
and autoimmune diseases of the thyroid [21] or between
CSU associated with thyroid disease and HLA [22].

The present study was a cross-sectional descriptive
analysis that had the objective of investigating the main
clinical and laboratory features and the antigen expression of
HLA classes I and II of patients with CSU seen by a
reference service in Brazil.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The participants were 67 Brazilians of both genders with
CSU. The study was coordinated by the Discipline of
Allergy and Clinical Immunopathology, of the Marilia
Medical School.

A detailed history and physical examination was obtained
rom each patient, with emphasis on general use of
medications and dietary characteristics. Cases of possible
ypersensitivity to medications or dietary allergies were
excluded, as were patients with clinical evidence of an
underlying systemic disease or physical urticaria.

The following laboratory tests were requested:
emogram, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), ALT,
AST, creatinine, serological tests for hepatitis B and C,
VDRL, urine I, protoparasitological tests (three samples),
total IgE. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were investigated
by means of indirect immunofluorescence (HEp-2) and antithyroperoxidase (anti-TPO) by means of an enzymatic
immunoassay. Patients with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism
who were using levothyroxine were included, provided that
their condition was clinically and _ laboratorially
compensated. Likewise, ANA-positive patients were
included, but only if they did not present other criteria for a
possible diagnosis of collagenosis.

The genotyping of the HLA system (A, B and DR) was
done on peripheral blood of 49 (73%) patients, using the
PCR-SSO molecular biological method (kit from One
Lambda Inc.), and the flow cytometry method (Labscan 100
apparatus with the SD-Luminex software).

 

The autologous serum skin test (ASST) was performed in
all patients, in accordance with previous descriptions [2],
being considered positive when the red weal was 1.5 mm
greater than a normal saline control.

All the patients signed an informed consent approved by
the ethics committee of Marilia Medical School and the
study was conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki.

The data were presented as means (M) and standard
deviations (SD). We used the odds ratios (OR) with 95%
confidence interval as a measure of association between the
variable analyzed.

RESULTS

The general characteristics of the patients evaluated are
summarized in Table 1. Sixty-seven adult patients of mean

Inflammation & Allergy - Drug Targets, 2013, Vol. 12, No.1 9

age 41.5 years (SD + 14.5), ranging from 18 to 73 years were
analyzed, of whom 46 (68%) were women. The mean time
that had elapsed between the start of the crises and the
medical consultation was 44.9 months (SD + 92.6). It should
be noted that in the great majority of the cases, the patient
had already been attended by other services. For 60 patients
(90% of the cases), the frequency of the crises was reported
as being daily, if the patient was not regularly using some
type of antihistamine. We found that the main factors
worsening the crises were the following: use of non-steroid
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) in 18 cases (27%);
emotional stress in 11 cases (16%); and physical stimuli
(including having a bath/shower, sports activities, any type
of local pressure or heat) in 10 cases (15%). Seven patients
(10%) reported that their urticaria worsened with ingestion
of specific foods or food additives. It should be noted that
the urticaria crises occurred spontaneously, even in the
absence of the aggravating factors described above.
However, as reported by the patients, there was a tendency
for the crises to become more intense when such situations
were present. In the majority of the patients (49 individuals;
73%), the clinical manifestation was composed of the
presence of urticaria and angioedema (generally on the face)
together, which sometimes presented concomitantly and
sometimes separately, depending on the occasion. Clinical
presentations consisting only of urticaria (ie. without
angioedema) were observed in 16 patients (24% of the
cases), while angioedema as the only form of clinical
presentation was seen in just two patients (3%).

 

 

Forty-nine patients (73%) presented positive ASST; antiTPO were observed in 15 patients (22.4%) and
hypothyroidism in 14 (20.8%) of the 67 patients analyzed.
Among the patients who were positive for anti-TPO, seven
presented hypothyroidism. Seven patients (10.5%) were
positive for ANA. Odds ratio (OR) analysis (with 95% CI)
for the association between the presence of anti-TPO and
positive ASST test results was 1.62 (0.4-6.58) and between
the presence of ANA and positive ASST test results was
2.37 (0.27-21.20). Thus, favorable associations were shown
in both of these cases, although without statistical
significance, because the value of one was present within
both confidence intervals. Analysis on the OR (with 95% CI)
of the association between positive findings for ANA and the
presence of anti-TPO showed an OR of 5.94 (1.16-30.42),
thus demonstrating a statistically significant association (the
value of one wasn’t present within the confidence interval).

Genotyping for HLA class I (loci A and B) and class II
(locus DRB1) was performed for 49 patients (73%). A
comparative analysis was done based on the frequencies
found in the healthy population in the same region [23]. The
frequency of HLA B*50 found in patients with CSU was
6.38% whereas in the healthy population it was 2.25%. We
found a favorable association for HLA B*50 among the
patients with CSU, with an OR (95% CI) of 2.96 (1.17-7.48),
which was thus statistically significant. For the others alleles
investigated found no statistical difference.

DISCUSSION

We found that the main factors worsening the crises were
use of NSAID, emotional stress and physical stimuli however
the urticaria crises occurred spontaneously, even in the absence

of these aggravating factors. It would be interesting to highlight
the worsening of the crises with emotional stress, which
occurred in 16% of the patients. This feature, which is often
seen in clinical practice, can be explained by the possible
interrelations between the immunological, neuroendocrine and
psychological systems. These relationships have been proven
through field research on chronic urticaria, by means of
analyses on fluctuations on the serum levels of cortisol,
corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) and adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH), as parameters indicative of the presence of
stress, in relation to basophile activation, as assessed using
CD63 expression [24].

With the aim of coming closer towards diagnosing
autoimmune chronic urticaria, we performed the ASST,
although we were aware that the accuracy of the ASST for
diagnosing autoimmune etiology is limited [25]. In fact,
ASST is considered to be an in vivo test that only given
assurance of auto reactivity and does not necessarily define
autoimmunity, although even so, it may indicate the
possibility of activation of mast cells by autoantibodies [25].
The high prevalence of positive ASST tests (73%) may be
explainable through the fact that this study was conducted at
a referral service to which screened cases of difficult-tocontrol urticaria are sent, which are therefore more likely to
be of autoimmune etiology.

We found that 15 patients (22.4%) were positive for antiTPO, which was similar to the rate seen in the literature [21].
Among these, seven patients (approximately 50%) also
presented hypothyroidism. Among the hypotheses corroborating
the association between thyroid disorders and CSU, there is the
possibility that similarities between thyroperoxidase and
endogenous and exogenous structures might “confuse the
immune system” and trigger an autoimmune reaction,
sometimes named an “autotoxic” reaction [26]. Furthermore,
the fact that we found a statistically significant reaction between
positive findings for ANA and the presence of anti-TPO
strengthens the possibility of an autoimmune mechanism in
these cases.

Although it is known that associations exist between several
autoimmune diseases and certain alleles of HLA [12], few
studies have correlated the antigen expression of the MHC with
chronic urticaria. Most of these studies have found that
predisposition towards urticaria presents possible associations
with the following alleles: HLA DRB1*04 [16, 17, 20]; HLABw4 and DQ! [18]; HLA-DRB1*0land DRB1*15 [19]; and
HLA-B44 [19, 20]; or an inverse (protective) relationship:
HLA-DRB1*15 [16]; HLA-A24 [18]. In the present study, we
analyzed the histocompatibility profile in 49 patients and found
a significant association between these patients and HLA B* 50.
Comparison between our study and these others allowed us to
suspect that the differences in findings between them were
possibly due to the ethnic and regional variations peculiar to
each study. It is of interest to note that when the profile of HLA
was studied only among ASST-positive, a strong trend towards
an association for this allele was found, although without
statistical significance [23]. On the basis of the current
understanding of CSU, the patients could be divided into three
subpopulations: autoimmune chronic urticaria, idiopathic
chronic urticaria, and a subgroup that overlaps the two but are
characterized with hypo-responsiveness of patients’ basophils to
anti-IgE and hyper responsiveness to serum [11]. Therefore,
association between CSU and profile HLA may be more
complex. These considerations may serve for future studies with
larger sample the patients can be sub-divided according to those
characteristics.

 

The action of T regulatory cells (Treg) in allergic and
autoimmune diseases has recently been much studied [27, 28],
in relation both to natural Treg cells, which develop during
thymopoiesis, and to adaptive T reg cells, which are generated
on the periphery consequent to a variety of stimuli (under
conditions that are said to be tolerogenic). With a tolerogenic
mechanism controlled by Treg cells, an escape of tolerance to
the self could occur, since variations in the binding capacity of
self antigens to the slot in the MHC may affect the process of T
cell education in the thymus. There could also be a population
of T reg cells that would be incapable of recognizing certain self
molecules. This might also correlate with genetic polymorphism

 
Chronic Urticaria: Epidemiological Characteristics, HLA and Antibodies

of the HLA. In addition, the suppressive effect of certain
cytokines like IL 10 and TGF-B, along with environmental
factors, may act on adaptive T reg cells [27, 28] and contribute
towards triggering allergies in a general manner. This reasoning
can be applied to chronic urticaria.

One point that might be criticized in the present study is that
the design used here (cross-sectional) is not ideal for this type of
analysis, which would be better done using a case-control
design. In the present study, the parameter used for comparisons
with the HLA alleles investigated in the patients were the
prevalences of these alleles obtained in a previous study on the
healthy population in the same region [23]. Questions could also
be raised because we did not evaluate other loci of HLA such as
MHC class I (locus C) or class II alleles (loci DP and DQ).
However, even with these limitations this study provides
information that can help us in future research on the CSU.
Therefore, this study allowed us to conclude that there is
significantly greater HLA B*5O expression in this group of
patients with CSU, and that there is a statistically significant
association between positive findings of anti-TPO and ANA
antibodies. These results suggest that genetic and autoimmune
mechanisms are present in the pathogenesis of CSU. We believe
that further research on this subject is necessary, reinforcing the
need to expand the sampling.
