Clinical Implications

e In chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), basopenia was
associated with more severe disease, whereas the basophil

responder phenotype was associated with longer disease.
Furthermore, the basophil activation test may be an
alternative method to basophil histamine release for
classifying basophil functional phenotypes in CSU.

 

TO THE EDITOR:

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is characterized by >6
weeks of spontaneous, pruritic hives. Despite CSU’s significant
impact on quality of life, few predictors are known for the
clinical course of disease. However, basophils have been shown
to have unique features in CSU. First, basopenia has been
linked to disease severity.' Second, studies have demonstrated.
suppression of the IgE pathway to histamine release (HR) in
active CSU compared with controls, with basophil hyporesponsiveness improving in disease remission.” * Lastly, basophils
are specifically recruited to skin lesions of patients with CSU.’
Given their altered phenotype in disease, basophil parameters
may help predict the clinical course of disease. Here we update
the preliminary report from Baker et al° with the analysis of
basophil parameters in patients with CSU using a larger,
expanded cohort including the initial participants. We also
include a subcohort for studies comparing HR and the basophil
activation test (BAT) for functional phenotyping.

Study approval was granted by the Johns Hopkins University
nstitutional Review Board. Patients >18 years of age with
allergist/dermatologist diagnosis of active CSU were recruited
rom Johns Hopkins specialty clinics between October 2004 and
September 2018. As per previous protocols,° study participants
underwent venipuncture and completed a written questionnaire
(including urticaria severity score for current symptoms and with
ares and the SkinDex-29 dermatology quality-of-life index) at
each study visit, with baseline visit data presented here. “®
Detailed methods for basophil HR and BAT assays are
described in the Methods section of this article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org.

Of the 182 subjects recruited, 159 provided adequate blood
samples for basophil functional phenotyping using HR, with 71
(45%) classified as basophil responders, 55 (35%) as nonresponders, and 33 (21%) as basopenics (able E1, available in
this article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org). Age,
gender, and race were similar among groups. In a subset (n = 33)
of subjects enrolled since June 2016, analysis of BAT using
CD63 (% gated, mean, median) was compared with
basophil functional classification using HR (%HR) profiling in

0.01 [g/mL anti-IgE stimulation (R° = 0.8050, P < .0001;
Figure El, B, available in this article’s Online Repository at
www, jaci-inpractice.org). In contrast, a correlation between BAT
and HR by all measures was poor with 1 [g/mL anti-IgE
stimulation (Figure El, C, available in this article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org).

With classification by HR as the reference standard, we also
determined the frequency of proper classification of basophil
functional phenotype using the BAT (Table 1). With 0.1 [ig/mL
anti-IgE stimulation, a cutoff value >13%CD63-gated BAT was
94.7% sensitive and 100% specific for the basophil responder
phenotype. With 0.01 [g/mL anti-IgE stimulation, a cutoff
value >6%CD63-gated BAT was 100% sensitive and specific.
No cutoff value at 1 [g/mL anti-IgE stimulation achieved
sensitivity and specificity greater than 80%.

With regard to clinical parameters, similar quality-of-life
impairment as assessed by the total SkinDex-29 score was
noted in basopenics, responders, and nonresponders (Table II).
However, the mean of the “Emotional” domain was significantly
higher for basopenics (29.6) compared with 24.1 for responders
(P = .036) and 25.3 for nonresponders (P = .041). The dif
ference between basopenics and nonresponders remained significant adjusting for confounders (Table E2, available in this
article’s Online Repository at www. jaci-inpractice.org). Basophil
responders were more likely to have longer disease duration, with
only 23.9% noting disease duration between 6 months and 2
years as compared with 48.5% of basopenics (P = .012) and
47.3% of nonresponders (P = .0062) (Table II). Adjusted odds
of having shorter disease duration was 3.3 for nonresponders
(95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5, 7.5; P = .004) and 3.7 for
basopenics (95% Cl: 1.4, 9.6; P = .007) relative to responders

Strengthening previous findings, many CSU disease severity
measures tracked with basopenia in our study. Specifically,
basopenics reported greater use of steroid tapers in the last year,
greatest current hive/itch scores and itch during flares, and
highest score on the SkinDex-29 emotional component. Taken
together, blood basopenia may indicate a more severe phase of
disease with increased recruitment of basophils to the skin that
may contribute to disease symptoms.’ Consistent with this
theory, patients with CSU who experience clinical improvement

with omalizumab also demonstrate a dose-related rise in blood
basophil count.”

We also examined an alternate method for basophil functional
phenotyping and found a strong correlation between HR and %
gated CD63 BAT at lower anti-IgE stimulation concentrations
(0.01 and 0.1 [g/mL), which has not been previously reported.'
However, at a higher anti-IgE concentration (1 [lg/mL), the correlation was poor. This is likely because at supraoptimal concentrations of anti-IgE stimulation, HR decreases whereas the dose
response plateaus in BAT. Although BAT may be used for CSU
basophil functional classification, direct measurement of HR should
first be conducted in a limited sample to assure a correlation between
both anti-IgE dose response curves.

In addition, the basophil responder phenotype was associated
with longer disease duration although responders may carry less
disease burden than basopenics. Prolonged disease duration in
responders is consistent with Baker et al’s 2009 study,” but our
remaining findings were not previously observed. This may be
explained by the small sample size (n = 50) of the previous
study. Although the present study has increased power overall,
limitations remain. First, the sample size for BAT versus HR
release was limited (n = 33) and results should be replicated with
a larger cohort. In addition, patient-reported survey characteristics may be subject to recall bias. The predominance of highly
educated Caucasian patients recruited from an urban, tertiary
care center may limit study generalizability. Lastly, data from the
baseline study visit are reported here. Future work will include
longitudinal analysis to correlate basophil functional measures
with disease evolution in CSU.

METHODS
Patient recruitment

Exclusion criteria included the use of systemic corticosteroids,
cyclosporine, or sulfasalazine in the last month or diagnosis of
concomitant urticarial vasculitis, atopic dermatitis, or physical
urticaria.

Basophil histamine release (HR) assay

Density gradient sedimentation (single Percoll density
centrifugation) was used to isolate blood basophils of patients
from venous blood samples." '!" Polyclonal goat antihuman IgE
(0.001-1.0 [ig/mL; DACI Lab, Baltimore, Md) was used in
duplicate to stimulate basophils for HR in calcium-containing
buffers and measured using automated fluorometry. In addition, basophils were stimulated using N-formyl-met-leu-phe
(fMLP) (107° M) asa positive control for basophil degranulation
as it is an independent pathway typically preserved in patients
with chronic spontaneous urticaria (csu),"” Supernatants
were collected and analyzed via automated fluorimetry. Results
are presented as the percentages of total histamine content of
total cell lysates of leukocyte aliquots after spontaneous HR was
subtracted. Total histamine content was defined as total histamine content released from lysed leukocytes derived from 1 mL
of whole blood minus the basal level of histamine released
spontaneously by basophils without stimulus (ie, in buffer). Per
previously optimized protocol, HR levels to 0.1 [g/mL concentration of IgE were used to classify basophil functional phenotypes. Patients with HR >10% of total histamine content
were categorized as “responders,” whereas those with response
<10% were categorized as “nonresponders. © Patients with
histamine concentrations <5 ng/mL blood leukocytes were
classified as “basopenics.” Evidence of a strong correlation between blood histamine content and independent verification of
basophil numbers by flow cytometry and enumeration has been
shown.’ “"?

 

Basophil activation test (BAT)

At the time of blood sampling for basophil HR, blood
samples were also collected in parallel into heparinized tubes
(BD vacutainer, San Jose, Calif) for flow studies. Heparinized
blood was immediately incubated with either buffer alone or
identical doses of anti-IgE antibody or fMLP for 30 minutes at
37°C. Samples were then washed and labeled with CD123
APC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY) and either
CCR3 PE (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or CD63 PE (Beckman
Coulter, Atlanta, Ga). Cells were subsequently lysed and fixed
(Beckman Coulter) and then analyzed on a BD FACS Calibur
flow cytometer. Basophils were gated using CCR3+, CD123+
cell subset and results expressed as both net mean fluorescence
intensity and % positive relative to buffer.” Exogenous IL-3
was not added to the BAT assay buffers, in contrast to the
Rauber et al!* study, in order to maintain consistent conditions between the HR results and BAT results.

Written questionnaire

A 3-part survey was administered to patients on the same
visit as their venipuncture." Part 1 included demographic
variables, CSU disease duration, family history of CSU,
medication usage, as well as CSU-related work/school

J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT
MONTH 2019

absenteeism and hospital/emergency department (ED) visits.
Part 2 was the urticaria severity score, an instrument used in
previous studies of CSU to quantify wheal size and number
and itching in the present time and during flares.'”""* Systemic
symptoms during flares were queried, with 4 classified as being
related to anaphylaxis: gastrointestinal, wheezing, palpitations,
and flushing. Part 3 was the SkinDex-29 questionnaire, a
validated dermatology instrument for assessing the impact of
skin disease on quality of life in the past 3 months."

Statistical analysis

Groups’ means were compared using the analysis of variance
test, whereas proportions of categorical variables were
compared using the ‘7 test and Fisher’s exact test. For results
showing significant differences, post hoc pairwise comparisons
were conducted using the Bonferroni method. Multivariable
linear/logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounders. A correlation between %HR and the BAT was
assessed by linear regression. Various threshold values were
tested to determine the sensitivity and specificity of BAT in
identifying basophil phenotypes, with classification by %HR as
the reference standard. All analyses were performed in Stata/IC
15.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Tex).

Results (Tables E1 and E3)

Clinical demographics were among groups
(Table El). By definition, histamine concentration per 1 mL
blood leukocytes was different among the 3 groups (P < .001)
and anti-lgE HR was higher in responders compared with
nonresponders (P < .001). In contrast to previous studies"!
with smaller samples, lower fMLP HR was reported in
nonresponders (29.5) compared with responders (39.6)
(P = .008).

Mean scores for “Symptom” and “Functional” domains of
the SkinDex-29 were similar between groups (P = .14 and
P = .17, respectively) (Table E3). Absent days due to urticaria
in the past year and lifetime were not different (P = .43 and
P = .87, respectively). Frequency of hospital/ED visits for
urticaria in the past year and lifetime were also not different
(P = .47 and P = 1.0, respectively). No differences were seen
between groups in the proportions of patients with positive
personal history of allergic comorbidities (P = .15) or in the
proportions of patients with positive family history, with
roughly 15% positive in all groups (P = 1.0). No differences
were seen among groups in any of the other (ie, nonsteroidal)
medications taken for urticaria, either currently or lifetime.
Lifetime requirements for one or more steroid tapers were
similar (P = .45). The mean score of the number and size of
hives during flares and the mean number of wheal locations
during flares were not significantly different among groups
(P = .32 and P = .A4, respectively). Durations of urticarial
wheals during flares were similar (P = .32). The mean number
of systemic symptoms during a flare was not significantly
different among the other groups (P = .52). Similarly, the
mean number of anaphylaxis-type symptoms (gastrointestinal,
wheezing, palpitations, flushing) was not significantly different
from other groups (P = .52). Proportions of each of the 4
symptoms of anaphylaxis were also not different between
groups (P > .05). In all groups, flushing was the most common
anaphylaxis-associated symptom, whereas palpitations were the
least common.
