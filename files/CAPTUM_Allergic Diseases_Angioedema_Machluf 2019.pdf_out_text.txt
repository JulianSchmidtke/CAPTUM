ABSTRACT

Objectives: Asthma is a multifactorial, heterogeneous, complex and common chronic
respiratory disease driven by diverse mechanisms. Although asthma presents various clinical
forms with different levels of severity, it is unclear whether asthma severities are a consequence of disease management or varied etiologies. We sought to investigate this question.
Methods: This article presents a cross-sectional study of 113,671 Israeli adolescents.
Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were performed to analyze the independent associations between mild asthma and moderate-to-severe asthma phenotypes
and coexistent medical conditions within each gender separately. Hierarchical clustering of
the odds ratios of the diverse statistically significant medical conditions associated with
asthma severity-gender groups was also performed. We focused on the allergic and neurological-cognitive-mental disorders.

Results: Among males, two associations were common to both asthma groups (atopic
dermatitis and allergic rhinitis), five unique to mild asthma (urticaria/angioedema,
Hymenoptera/bee allergies, allergic conjunctivitis, epilepsy and migraine) and two unique to
moderate-to-severe asthma (learning disabilities and ADD/ADHD (Attention-deficit disorder/
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder)). Among females, two associations were common to
both clinical asthma groups (allergic rhinitis and urticaria/angioedema), and five unique to
moderate-to-severe asthma (atopic dermatitis, learning disabilities, ADD/ADHD, anxiety/
mood disorders and migraine). Allergic rhinitis was the only condition to be associated with
all four groups. Learning disabilities and ADD/ADHD were only associated with moderate-tosevere asthma (but not with mild asthma), in both males and females. Hierarchical clustering analysis uncovered two prominent clusters, separating mild from moderate-tosevere asthma.

Conclusions: The differences between mild and moderate-to-severe asthma enhance
asthma phenotype characterization, with respect to comorbidities, and indicate varied etiologies.

Introduction

Asthma is a multifaceted, complex and common
chronic respiratory disease that affects over 330 million people worldwide. Its prevalence, clinical impact
upon quality of life and healthcare expenditure, alongside mortality and morbidity statistics, provide a complete and relevant indication of its significance and
global burden (1-3). Its pathophysiology includes
abnormalities of the immune regulation of allergic,
inflammatory and neuroendocrine responses (4,5). It
is characterized by intermittent bronchial hyperresponsiveness and reversible airway obstruction, yet
presents with multiple clinical forms and levels of
severity. In light of this clinical and pathophysiological

heterogeneity, there have been numerous attempts to
define asthma phenotypes (6-18). Although early
attempts were merely one-dimensional emphasizing a
simple classification criterion such as the duality of
atopic versus non-atopic asthma, later attempts were
based on either disease symptom severity or asthma
pathogenesis, and more recent analyses have clustered
patients by multiple features (19-21). Each phenotype
is defined using some or all of the following respiratory symptoms and/or other clinical, trigger-related,
healthcare utilization and treatment, demographic
and pathological parameters: interactions between
genetic and environmental factors, clinical severity,
age of onset, atopy, physiological indicators and

inflammatory cells involved in the pathophysiologic
pathway, spirometry, airway hyperresponsiveness,
exhaled nitric oxide (NO) concentration, requirement
for medication and type of treatment, persistence of
wheezing (treatment responsiveness), triggers and trigger-related phenotypes, healthcare utilization and
comorbidities. Recently, elucidation of asthma phenotypes has been further refined on the basis of pathophysiologic mechanisms (endotypes) and associated
biomarkers (19,22,23). Of note, transitions between
asthma phenotypes were common, mainly in early
childhood but less in late childhood (18).
Classification of asthma phenotypes is important for
understanding these mechanistically distinct groups
and identifying relevant and distinctive cellular or
molecular biomarkers and then, hopefully, predicting
prognosis, clinical response, outcome and ultimately,
achieving personalized targeted therapy.

As asthma is such a common diagnosis, other conditions frequently occur concurrently. A recent, large
cross-sectional analysis (24) revealed that 36 of 39
assessed comorbidities were more common in adults
with asthma, where 62.6% (compared with 46.2% of
non-asthmatic adults) had at least one coexisting condition and 16.3% (compared with 8.7%) had four or
more coexisting conditions. Asthma comorbidity places a significant burden on individuals and the healthcare system with higher rates of hospitalization,
emergency department visits and ambulatory care
claims among individuals with asthma compared with
those without asthma (25-27). Increasing attention
has been paid in recent years to comorbidities
(28-34), including allergic diseases (such as allergic
rhinitis, food allergies, hymenoptera sting allergy,
atopic atopic skin conditions),
migraine (35), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) and psychogenic disorders (depressive or
mood disorders and anxiety). These were shown to be
more prevalent among asthmatic subjects and some
may be related to a more severe form of asthma,
refractoriness to treatment, impaired health-related
quality of life and increasing demand on resources. In
addition, smoking-related comorbidities, metabolic
syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
and obstructive sleep apnea were shown to be associated with asthma and to influence its clinical manifestation and treatment response. The associations of
specific asthma phenotypes with specific comorbidities
and their impact on asthma control and management
were investigated (33,36-38), as such comorbidities
may be coincidental findings or they may contribute
directly to asthma severity (39) and to difficult-to
 

dermatitis and

treat phenotype (33). Recently, a diagnostic and management algorithm for assessing comorbid conditions
in patients with severe asthma was outlined (33).

A notable sex disparity has been observed in
asthma prevalence, incidence, severity, hospitalization
rate and duration, being more common and severe in
boys during early childhood, equalizing during adolescence and having female predominance in adulthood
(40-42). The role of sex hormones, genetic predisposition and comorbidities in airway inflammation,
smooth muscle contraction, mucus production and
airway mechanics has been demonstrated (43,44).
Identifying sex-specific risk factors for asthma (45)
may have potential diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic implications.

Previously, we employed a comparative approach
to characterize mild asthma and moderate-to-severe
asthma with reference to subjects without asthma
among Israeli adolescent males and females separately,
while examining secular trends and relationships with
sociodemographic variables and anthropometric indices (46). Differences between asthma severity phenotypes among males and females suggested that
different mechanisms might be involved in the pathogenesis of mild compared with moderate-to-severe
asthma, and between males and females (46). Here,
we take a further step, defining heterogeneity of
asthma among males and females based on coexistent
medical conditions. This approach may shed light on
the origin and development of diverse asthma phenotypes and hopefully have an impact on management.

Methods
Data source

Military service is compulsory in Israel though various
minorities and religious exempt.
Mandatory pre-induction medical examination of all
recruits takes place at regional recruitment centers
where they undergo a comprehensive medical interview and physical examination by board certified
physicians who then refer for further investigation as
necessary. At the end of the medical process, a medical profile and appropriate Functional Classifications
Codes (FCCs) describing the medical status and severity as well as an occupational ranking, are assigned to
each recruit. Medical data and all FCCs are routinely
stored in the main Israel Defense Force (IDF) database (47) which was the source of the data analyzed
in this study. The medical processes and data are routinely assessed and evaluated for control and assurance (47-50). More detailed information on the
medical process and database, as well as characteristics
of the population, can be seen elsewhere (51).

The study population

The study population included all northern district
recruits examined at one recruitment center between
the years 1987-2010 inclusive. To ensure a uniform
medical baseline, we focused on conscripts who completed the medical profiling process at the age of
16-19. No selection criteria (neither inclusive nor
exclusive) were applied. Only the northern recruitment
center was chosen as the medical examinations at this
center were performed by a small group of highly
trained medical personnel with subsequent documented
high quality of its medical processes (48). The study
was approved by the IDF Institutional Review Board,
approval number 1199-2012 and was conducted in
compliance with the Helsinki Agreement.

cough, dyspnea on effort, asthma attacks upon exposure to allergens during the last 3 years and use of
medication. This was subdivided into mild asthma
(normal rest and exercise spirometry including lack of
confirmed reversible airflow obstruction or bronchial
hyper-reactivity and medication only as needed) and
moderate-to-severe asthma (evidence of airway hyperreactivity on spirometry including confirmed reversible airflow obstruction or bronchial hyper-reactivity
and medication on a daily basis). These correspond to
the GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma) classifications

severe” persistent asthma groupings (http://www.medicalcriteria.com/criteria/pul_asthma.htm), which were
the most recent and acceptable criteria at the time of

Definitions of anthropometric indices and
comorbidities

In addition to anthropometric and medical data, the
computerized database contained further personal,
educational and socio-demographic information about
each recruit as recorded by the Ministry of Internal
Affairs. This was validated and updated by interviews
and questionnaires. Socio-demographic variables were
included in the analysis. Many findings have been
previously reported (46) and we now report novel
findings regarding the additional coexistent medical
conditions. Definitions of these key variables, which
were used in the univariate analysis (and if statistically
significant also in the multivariable logistic regression
analysis), are provided in detail in Appendix A.

As this study aims to investigate the independent
associations between comorbidities and the outcome
in the two asthma groups (mild or moderate-tosevere) for each gender separately, a three-step process
was applied:

First, a distinct univariate analysis was conducted
for each of the four combinations of clinical asthma

females, moderate-to-severe asthma among females),
with the two reference groups comprising subjects of
the corresponding gender without asthma (males without asthma and females without asthma). Univariate
analyses used Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test to compare categorical variables between groups and unpaired
Student’s T-test for continuous variables.

Subsequently, a distinct multivariable logistic
regression model was conducted for each combination
of clinical asthma group and gender again using the
above two reference groups. Covariates in each model
included variables which were found to be significantly associated with the outcome in the univariate
analysis as described in Appendix B, ie. the criterion
for entrance into each of the regression models was a
probability value of P< 0.05 in the corresponding univariate analysis, and P>0.10 for removal from the
model. Co-linear variables were excluded from the
models, which were adjusted to control for potentially
confounding effects. Associations of each of the two
clinical asthma groups were compared with each
other, treating each gender separately. Odds ratios
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were
calculated. The statistical tests were two-tailed.

A similar approach was conducted directly comparing moderate-to-severe asthma subjects to mild
asthma subjects (as reference).

All analyses were carried out using the SPSS statistical
package (version 22.0; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY).

Clustering analysis

Hierarchical clustering of the ORs of the different
medical conditions (only allergic as well as neurological-cognitive-mental disorders were taken into
account) and asthma severity-gender groups, was performed with Partek® Genomics Suite” software, version 6.6 Copyright ©; 2014 Partek Inc., St Louis, MO,
USA; with Pearson’s dissimilarity and complete linkage.
Of note, only statistically significant associations in the
multivariable analysis were included, whereas non-significant values (variables included in the multivariable
analysis) or missing values (variables not included in
the multivariable analysis, due to lack of association in
the univariate analysis) were conferred a value of 1,
namely no significant association/difference.

Results
Study population

The initial study population comprised 158,255 subjects, of whom 59% were males. To ensure a uniform

and valid medical baseline, we focused on 116,979
records of conscripts who completed the medical
profiling process between 16 and 19 years of age. Of
these, 3308 records lacked height and/or weight data
and were omitted. The final study population comprised 113,671 adolescents including 66,547 males and
47,124 females.

Associations with coexistent medical conditions

In order to investigate the independent associations
between comorbidities and anthropometric indices
and the outcome in the two asthma groups (mild or
moderate-to-severe) separately within genders, analyses were conducted to compare each of the four categories (mild asthma among males, moderate-to-severe
asthma among males, mild asthma among females
and moderate-to-severe asthma among females) with
its corresponding reference group (males without
asthma and females without asthma). We conducted
univariate analyses and consequent
logistic regression models as described above in the
Methods section. The comprehensive associations with
coexistent medical conditions found by univariate
analysis are shown in the Supplementary Table S1 and
described in Appendix B. The multivariable analysis
findings are shown in the Supplementary Table S2.
Notably, each of the multivariable logistic regression
models encompasses diverse personal and _ sociodemographic variables, anthropometric indices and
medical comorbidities which were significantly associated with the asthma severity and gender group. Yet,
we focus on the well-established associations with
allergic as well as neurological-cognitive-mental conditions as presented in Figure 1.

Among males, the multivariable logistic regression
models conducted for each group revealed seven positive associations with mild asthma (Figure 1A) and
four with moderate-to-severe asthma (Figure 1B) only two were common to both groups (atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis), five unique to mild asthma
(urticaria/angioedema, Hymenoptera/bee allergies,
allergic conjunctivitis, epilepsy and migraine) and two
unique to moderate-to-severe asthma (learning disabilities and ADD/ADHD).

Among females, the multivariable logistic regression models conducted for each group revealed only
two positive associations with mild asthma (Figure
1C) and
(Figure 1D) - two were common to both clinical
asthma groups (allergic rhinitis and urticaria/angioedema), and five unique to moderate-to-severe asthma

(atopic dermatitis, learning disabilities, ADD/ADHD,
anxiety/mood disorders and migraine).

Among the allergic and _neurological-cognitivemental conditions, allergic rhinitis was the only condition to be associated with all four groups. The positive
associations of allergic rhinitis with asthma had the
largest OR (at least 6.8 compared with a range of
~1.5-3). Learning disabilities and ADD/ADHD were
only associated with the moderate-to-severe form of
asthma but not with mild asthma, in both males and
females (Figure 1). Pneumothorax was only associated
with moderate-to-severe asthma in males and with
mild asthma in females (OR of ~6 and 19, respectively, Supplementary Table S2). No protecting effects
in these two clinical asthma groups were observed.

Hierarchical clustering

Distinctive patterns of associations of medical conditions with clinical asthma phenotypes emerged within
genders and between genders. In addition, within each
of the four groups, diverse positive associations were
observed among the allergic and _neurological
cognitive-mental conditions. To further investigate the
intricate relationships between clinical asthma severity
and gender (with regard to medical signature of allergic and neurological-cognitive-mental conditions)
hierarchical clustering was conducted.

Two prominent clusters were obtained: one within
the mild asthma categories of both genders, and the
other, within the moderate-to-severe categories of
both genders (Figure 2). The medical conditions were
mixed rather than being segregated into allergic and
neurological-cognitive-mental conditions.

The cluster of moderate-to-severe asthma was characterized by positive associations of asthma with allergic rhinitis, ADD/ADHD, learning disabilities and
atopic dermatitis in both genders. Anxiety/mood disorder, urticaria/angioedema and migraine were associated with asthma only in females and there were no
associations with allergic conjunctivitis, epilepsy and
Hymenoptera/bee allergies.

In females the neurological-cognitive-mental condi
anxiety/mood disorder and

tions were mainly associated with moderate-to-severe
asthma, and in males the allergic conditions were
mainly associated with mild asthma (Figures 1 and 2).

Direct comparison of asthma phenotypes’associated comorbidities

To further assess differences between comorbidities
associated with asthma severity groups, moderate-tosevere asthma subjects (n = 2,077) were directly compared with mild asthma subjects (n = 2,504). A similar
approach was applied, in which variables significantly
associated with increased/decreased risk of developing
moderate-to-severe asthma were entered into a multivariable logistic regression model. This direct analysis
further supports the association of the allergic comorbidities (allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, allergic
conjunctivitis, and borderline significance of urticaria
and angioedema) and neurological-cognitive-mental
comorbidities (learning disorders, migraine, ADD/
ADHD and anxiety-depression) with increased risk of
developing moderate-to-severe asthma (Figure 3). In
addition, female gender, above normal body mass
index (BMI) and hypertension are all associated with

increased risk of developing moderate-to-severe
asthma, whereas family related variables (eldest child

and bigger family size) display a protective effect.

Discussion

The disparities between mild and moderate-to-severe
asthma, among both males and females, with regard
to associations with comorbidities (mainly allergic and
neurological-cognitive-mental conditions) may suggest
varied etiologies. The findings of this study are consistent with our previous analysis based on secular
trends of asthma prevalence as well as association
with socio-demographic and anthropometric risk factors (46). This study further strengthens the growing
body of evidence supporting this notion.

This study’s major strengths include a large population size (113,671 adolescents), long period of data
collection (24years), a uniform screening process for
all subjects based on thorough anamnesis and standardized high-quality medical examinations, and stable
diagnostic criteria for asthma and the other medical
conditions, throughout the study period. A high-quality asthma diagnosis was made by experts in pulmonology based on physical examination and pulmonary
function tests and supported by inquiry about medical
history and documentation. Other objective evidence
including exhaled NO and methacholine bronchial
challenge, was collected in some subjects and we

reported physician-designated diagnosis and severity
(data not shown). Similar rigorous screening procedures were applied for all other comorbidities, regardless of asthma existence and conditions. Noteworthy,
diagnosis of medical conditions among all study
population - both asthmatic subjects and non-asthmatic ones - is based on the same medical screening
process, rather than a subject-driven referral to clinic.
Cross-sectional surveys and small cohorts support the
relationship of asthma with diverse comorbidities
including: upper airway diseases (rhinitis - usually
allergic, sinusitis and rhinosinusitis), neurologic disorders (learning disorders - mainly ADHD, migraine
and epilepsy) and psychological dysfunction (depression, anxiety, mood and behavioral disorders), GERD
and other gastrointestinal (GI) diseases (dyspepsia),
laryngeal dysfunction (mainly paradoxical vocal fold
movement), pulmonary and__ bronchial
(chronic obstructive lung disease, bronchiectasis,
bronchitis, bronchopneumonia, recurrent respiratory
infections), atherosclerotic cardiac disease and circulatory disorders, dermatologic conditions (eczema/psoriasis), connective tissue/rheumatic diseases, metabolic
disorders and hormonal imbalance, immunologic and
hematologic disease, obesity, sleep apnea and chronic
pain conditions (24,28-31). Assessing the prevalence

diverse profiles and clinical asthma phenotypes in

unique associations, separating mild from moderate-tosevere asthma and supporting the notion of differential
mechanisms in the development of asthma severity
groups. The medical conditions were mixed rather than
segregated into allergic and neurological-cognitive-mental conditions, suggesting intricate interactions between
asthma and coexistent diseases.

Direct comparison between moderate-to-severe
asthma to mild asthma further supported the associations of allergic comorbidities and neurological-cognitive-mental with risk of
developing moderate-to-severe asthma. It also brought
to light associations of lactase deficiency and hypertension with development of moderate-to-severe asthma.
Little is known on these associations which required
further study. Altogether, this analysis strengthens the
notion that the two asthma severity groups are probably etiologically distinct phenotypes of asthma.

comorbidities increased

Focusing on associations with particular
comorbidities

The following will focus on associations of asthma
severity and gender groups with ADHD and atopic
dermatitis - and discuss the possible implications of
these associations. These were both associated the
moderate-to-severe asthma, and the latter with mild
asthma only in males.

Asthmatic children have a higher risk of ADHD,
where the magnitude of association increases with
asthma severity (55). Increased rates and severity of
attention-deficit symptoms have been demonstrated in
asthmatic children, with distinct gender differences
(56). This may be due to the burden of their medical
condition and may reflect the negative impact of
asthma on neurobehavioral health. Swedish twin modeling indicated that the association of childhood asthma
with the subsequent development of hyperactivityimpulsivity could be partly explained by genetic influences. Nevertheless, it was suggested that ADHD and
asthma are independently transmitted in families.

Children with ADHD are more likely to have not
only asthma but also atopic dermatitis as well as allergic conditions (allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis). In addition, the odds of having ADHD and
asthma have been reported to significantly increase in
children with atopic dermatitis. Boulet and Boulay
(29) claimed that “there is epidemiological evidence of
an overlap between asthma and atopic dermatitis in
early life, in addition to being a risk factor for asthma,
particularly in regard to some severe forms
of asthma”.

 

The mechanism of this association remains unclear.
Yet, the hippocampus might potentially be the connecting link between these conditions. Both asthma
(in males) (57) and ADHD (58) are associated with
structural brain differences - mainly a smaller hippocampal volume. The hippocampus has been shown to
be associated with other medical conditions whose
association with asthma was established previously
and in this study, such as epilepsy (59) and allergic
conditions (60).

Another potential connecting link is the transient
receptor potential vanilloid type 1 which was shown
to play a key role in both the manifestation of various
symptoms of airway hypersensitivity including asthma
(61), disorders associated with hyperdopaminergia
such as ADHD, and atopic dermatitis. It was also
shown to be involved in migraine pathophysiology.

High levels of stress are associated with all these
conditions and predominantly, the more severe form
of asthma (62). Not only was drug treatment for
asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis more
common among ADHD subjects, but also medication
prescription for asthma and allergic rhinitis among
parents was associated with ADHD treatment in their
children (63).
pathophysiological mechanisms and genes have been
suggested to underlie both asthma and ADHD, some
of which may also be related to atopic dermatitis. All
these possible connecting links are expected to be

 

Diverse, common immune-related

more prominent in subjects with a more severe form
of asthma.

Although a limited influence of more health seeking behavior is possible, the stringent screening active
procedures to substantiate the diagnoses as well as the
mechanisms that we bring as possible biological
explanation of the association, and the already wellestablished association described in the literature all
point toward a true association between asthma and
ADHD. Furthermore, had the association been due to
health seeking behavior, it would have the same effect
in mild asthma and moderate- severe asthma groups,
rather than only the later.

Concluding remarks, limitations and
future directions

Whereas the symptoms of asthma severity groups are
easily recognized, our understanding of the incident
factors, pathogenesis, prognosis and treatment of
asthma remains incomplete. Better characterization of
asthma phenotypes is required, from both an etiological and clinical perspective. This cross-sectional
study contributes innovative insights into the field of
asthma research by providing a comparative view of
mild asthma and moderate-to-severe asthma in reference to subjects without asthma, among Israeli adolescent males and females separately, while incorporating
coexisting medical conditions. This study adds to our
previous report that used a similar protocol but
focused on secular trends in asthma prevalence and
its associations with anthropometric indices and
socio-demographic variables (46).

This study illuminates differences and similarities
based on stratification of gender and asthma severity.
The findings suggest that perhaps different mechanisms and probably etiological bases are involved in
the pathogenesis of mild compared with moderate-tosevere asthma, and between males and females. The
differences might have implications not just for our
view of asthma pathogenesis and progression in different sub-populations, but also for asthma (and comorbidities) diagnosis, monitoring and treatment.

The limitations of this study include being
restricted to one recruitment center and to a certain
age group, an under-representation of certain populations (such as minorities and religious women that
are exempt from service), lack of additional background information on socio-demographic and lifestyle (socio-economic (SES) and
smoking habits) and genetic information. Information
about age of asthma onset, which is directly related to
some asthma phenotype classifications (13,14), was
not available. We have no longitudinal data therefore
we could not assess natural history and progression of
the disease. Furthermore, the initial classification of
asthma severity were based on asthma symptoms
exacerbation frequency - as evident in the more
recent and common GINA classifications at the time
of data collection. However,
research led to the development of evidence-based
guidelines, rather than a consensus of expert opinion,
and a major paradigm shift to control-based asthma
management, as developed by The National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute, The British Thoracic
Society and GINA - “each using the same volume of
evidence but emphasizing aspects particular to their
specific patient populations and socioeconomic needs”
(64). It would be interesting and valuable to apply a
similar study design employing the current classification of asthma phenotypes and severity.

Future attempts to profile the “medical signature”
of asthmatic adolescents should use parallel protocols
among children and adults (males and females separately), as well as longitudinally follow the progression

of such profiles over time. This could provide a highresolution and dynamic definition of asthma phenotypes (6) and promote our understanding of the disease state and identify more precise preventive
strategies, leading to personalized therapeutics (13).
Big data analytics and diverse modeling approaches
and tools - beyond mining and patterning longitudinal data - may advance the translation of asthma
phenotypic discovery into mechanistic insights and
actionable solutions such as better diagnostic decisionmaking and clinical practice (65). For example, by
investigating the extent of within-phenotype variations
and delineating more precisely the characteristics of
the individual trajectories assigned to each phenotype.
These findings would have significant medical, financial and healthcare implications, at both the individual
and national levels.

Appendix A

Criteria for the diagnosis of each medical
condition (variables)

This study is aimed at providing an overarching characterization of the medical signature of asthma severity phenotypes, within each gender separately. Therefore, on one
hand diverse medical conditions were grouped together,

while focusing on the more common medical conditions
among conscripts, such as scoliosis/kyphosis and refraction
errors. Other medical conditions, such as allergy and neurologic-cognitive-mental disorders, which were shown to be
associated with asthma, were separated into the sub-conditions constituting them, in order to provide a higher resolution. No self- reported measurements were used in this
study. The medical conditions were as follows.

Allergies

Allergic conjunctivitis

Diagnosis was made according to previous documentation,
a history of redness of conjunctiva, edema, itching and lacrimation associated with season and/or allergens and verified by an eye specialist.

Allergic rhinitis

Diagnosis was made according to previous documentation
verified by ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist or allergy
specialist. Diagnosis required chronic rhinitis associated
with allergens and/or season of year.

Atopic dermatitis

Diagnosis was made according to previous documentation
and history of characteristic itchy, red, swollen rash of skin,
associated with seasons and/or allergens according to diagnosis of a certified dermatologist or allergy specialist.

Hymenoptera/bee allergies

Hymenoptera allergy was diagnosed according to previous
documentation and history of reaction to bee, yellow jacket
or hornet sting accompanied by swelling. rash, angioedema
or anaphylactic shock and verified by skin tests as well as
specific Immunoglobulin E tests and confirmed by an
allergy specialist.

Urticaria and angioedema/food allergies

Diagnosis was made according to previous documentation
and characteristic history of typical general skin rash (hives)
for urticaria, general swelling including swelling of the neck,
face, tongue and larynx for angioedema, specific skin tests
and IgE levels for specific foods allergy, verified by a specialist in allergy.

 

Neurologic-cognitive-mental disorders

Epilepsy

Diagnosis of epilepsy was made according to previous documentation involving recurrent general or focal seizures, a
neurological workup including EEG and certified by a specialist neurologist.

Migraine

The diagnosis of migraine relied on at least 1 year’s documentation of headaches with typical characteristics of a
migraine, which was verified by a neurologist.

Learning disabilities

Learning disabilities were diagnosed by specific psychodiagnostic tests and verified by neurologist and or psychiatrist examination. In this analysis, only the severe learning
disorders were included, such those accompanied with dyspraxia or coordination problems.
Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder

ADD/ADHD was diagnosed according to specific psychodiagnostic tests and verified by a neurologist or psychiatrist
examination. In this analysis, only severe ADD/ADHD was
included, requiring daily consumption of medication
(Ritalin or Concerta).

Anxiety-mood disorder/depression

Anxiety and mood disorders were diagnosed according to
previous documentation from a certified psychologist or
psychiatrist, relied on typical medical history and was verified by an examination by a certified psychiatrist at the
recruitment center.

Other diseases

Gastro-esophageal reflux disease

Diagnosis was made according to previous documentation
and characteristic history of heartburn, bloating, taste of
acid and food coming back to the mouth (reflux), tightness
of breathing and chest characteristically after meals, and
certified by a specialist gastroenterologist.

Irritable BOWEL Syndrome (IBS)

Irritable bowel syndrome was diagnosed by certified gastroenterologist after a work up including blood laboratory tests
to exclude other conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), imaging including ultrasound of abdomen, computerized tomography (CT) on GI tract, endoscopy and
colonoscopy.

Inflammatory bowel disease

IBD was diagnosed by certified gastroenterologists, relying
on medical history, laboratory blood workup demonstrating
elevated C-reactive protein, sediment rate and fecal calprotectin levels as well as other serological indexes as well as a
thorough GI workup including CT, magnetic resonance
enterography and endoscopy including colonoscopy.
Diagnosis was verified by results of typical findings and
histopathological findings.

Lactase deficiency
Lactase deficiency was diagnosed by a certified gastroenterologist relying on medical history and laboratory workup.

Scoliosis/Kyphosis
Spine deformities included scoliosis and kyphosis as established by clinical examination and X-ray imaging.

 

Chest deformations

Chest deformation was diagnosed according to characteristic findings on physical examination by two physicians and
included pectus excavatum, pectus carinatum and other
deformations of chest wall. In cases of a moderate-to-severe
deformity, a spirometry was performed to assess possible
restrictive condition.

Diabetes mellitus

Diabetes mellitus diagnosis was established by fasting blood
glucose levels above 126mg/dL for those examined after
1998, and above 140 mg/dL for those examined during previous years in repeated analysis, and or 2h post-prandial
glucose levels above 200 mg/dL. The change in the fasting
glucose level threshold was made according to changes in

JOURNAL OF ASTHMA @&) 13

definition as decided by the World Health Organization
(WHO) and National Health Institute (NIH).

Autoimmune connective tissue diseases

This group of diseases included rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren disease, scleroderma,
mixed connective tissue disease, polymyositis dermatomyositis and psoriatic arthritis. Diagnosis of the conditions was
made according toprevious medical documentation,
accepted criteria including complete laboratory workup and
confirmation by a specialist in rheumatology.

Hyperlipidemia
Hyperlipidemia was diagnosed as low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol levels above 150 mg/dL and/or triglyceride levels
above 200 mg/dL.

Cardiac anomalies (heart disease)

Cardiac anomalies were diagnosed according to cardiologist
examination and Echo Doppler study. Cardiac anomalies
included valvar abnormalities such as bicuspid aortic valve,
aortic valve insufficiency or stenosis, mitral valve insufficiency or stenosis, pulmonary stenosis or insufficiency, tricuspid valve insufficiency or stenosis. Non-valvar anomalies
included patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, coarctation of the aorta, tetralogy of
Fallot, complete transposition of great vessels and
dextrocardia.

Pneumothorax

Pneumothorax was diagnosed relying on findings of pulmonologist, previous documentation including discharge letters
from hospital and by performing spirometry and Xray imaging.

Hoarseness

Hoarseness was diagnosed according to examination and
previous documentation and was substantiated by a certified
ENT specialist following examination of the larynx and
pharynx for possible pathologies.

Eating disorders
Eating disorders were diagnosed by certified psychiatrists
relying on additional documentation and on a thorough
psychiatric status examination verifying criteria for eating
disorders by International Classification of Diseases.

Sleep disorders
Sleep disorders included mainly sleep apnea syndrome and
somnambulism diagnosed at a certified sleep disorders
laboratory and verified by a sleep disorders specialist.

The following anthropometric indices were included in
the univariate analyses.

 

Body mass index

BMI groups were defined according to gender-related percentiles for 17-year old BMI on growth charts of the Israeli
Ministry of Health, similarly to the approach of the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The actual definitions were as follows: Obesity - above the 95th percentile
(>28.2 and >29.6 kg/m for males and females, respectively); Overweight - the 85th-95th percentiles (25.0-28.2
and 25.2-29.6 kg/m”); Underweight - below 5th percentile
(<17.6 and <17.2kg/m’). The age of 17 years was chosen as
14 © Y. MACHLUF ET AL.

the median age [and interquartile range] of males and
females was 17.35 [17.08-17.9] and 17.24 [17.02-17.63],
respectively.

Blood pressure
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) measures (herein
SBP and DBP, respectively) were obtained by a sphygmomanometer, in a relaxed, sitting position. Categories were
defined following age (17 years old)- and height (174 and
162cm for males and females, respectively) - adjusted definitions of Ministry of Health. Six categories were defined
hierarchically based on clinical severity: Missing BP: either
DBP = 0 or SBP = 0; Abnormal BP: either DBP = 1-39 or
SBP = 1-79 or SBP-DBP < 20; Hypertension type II
(>99th percentile + 5mmHg): either DBP > 90 or SBP >
146/139 or males/females or recruits belonging to 1 of the
3BP categories indicated below and having FCC indicative
of taking medications due to hypertension type II;
Hypertension type I (>95th percentile and <99th percentile
+ 5mmHg): DBP = 86-90 or SBP = 135-146/129-139 for
males/females; Pre-hypertension (>90th percentile and
<95th percentile + 5mmHg): DBP = 80-85 or SBP =
120-134/120-138 for males/females; Hypotension: DBP =
40-49 or SBP = 80-89; Normal BP: DBP = 50-79 or SBP
= 90-119. Diagnosis of hypertension warranted also further
workup including ten measurements of BP every alternate day.

The following socio-demographic variables were included
in the univariate analyses: year of birth, season of birth,
country of birth, migration status, education, religion, residential area, family size (number of children in the family),
birth order (place of child among children), age of parents
at child’s birth (advanced/young parental age) and SES.

These variables and the related findings were described
in detail previously (see reference 46 and __ its
Supplementary Material).

 

 

Appendix B

Description of univariate analysis findings
Associations in males

Of the medical conditions, 12 conditions were associated
with either mild asthma or moderate-to-severe asthma - all
associated with a higher risk among the asthmatic male populations (compared with the corresponding non-asthmatic
ones). Of these, six variables were associated with both mild
and moderate-to-severe asthma (Allergic rhinitis, allergic
dermatitis, urticarial/angioedema/food allergies, learning disorders, migraine and allergic conjunctivitis), two variables
were only associated with mild asthma (Hymenoptera/bee
allergies and epilepsy) and four variables were only associated
with moderate-to-severe asthma (ADHD/ADD, hyperlipidemia, pneumothorax and hoarseness).

Associations in females

Of the medical conditions, 12 conditions were associated
with either mild asthma or moderate-to-severe asthma — al
associated with a higher risk among the asthmatic female
populations (compared with the corresponding non-asthmatic ones, with one exception: learning disorders was less
prevalent among the mild asthma phenotype). Of these, five
variables were associated with both mild and moderate-tosevere asthma (Allergic rhinitis, allergic dermatitis, urticarial/angioedema/food allergies, learning disorders and allergic conjunctivitis), one variable was only associated with
mild asthma (Scoliosis/Kyphosis) and six variables were
only associated with = moderate-to-severe asthma
(Hymenoptera/bee allergies, GERD, sleep disorder,
migraine, anxiety-mood disorder/depression, ADHD/ADD).

 

Only these variables, which were shown to be significantly associated with either of the asthma severity-gender
groups, were included in the corresponding multivariable
logistic regression models.
