Although the efficacy of omalizumab has been clearly
demonstrated in the treatment of chronic spontaneous
urticaria (CSU), its mechanism of action, which results
in improvement in CSU symptoms, is not entirely understood. This study investigated the effect of omalizumab on expression of the high-affinity IgE receptor
(FceRI) on blood basophils from patients with active
CSU, and its association with the clinical response. Patients exhibiting significant clinical improvement showed a sharp reduction in the levels of basophil FceRI
after 4 weeks, which was maintained throughout the
total duration of the treatment. Such evolution was
not observed in non-responder patients. Furthermore,
non-responders showed significantly lower baseline
levels of FceRI than responders. Baseline basophil
FceRI expression was found to be a potential immunological predictor of response to omalizumab (100%
sensitivity and 73.2% specificity). The results of this
study contribute to our knowledge of the therapeutic
benefit and mechanism of action of anti-IgE therapy
in CSU.

hronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) represents the
most common subtype of chronic urticaria and is
defined as the appearance of evanescent wheals, angioedema or both, which occurs suddenly and persists for
longer than 6 weeks (1, 2). Although CSU is usually not
a life-threatening condition, its symptoms (cutaneous
swelling, itch and pain) may have a profound impact on
various aspects of patients’ everyday life (2).
Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal anti-IgE antibody that specifically binds circulating
IgE, preventing its attachment to the high-affinity IgE
receptor (FceRI) of immune cells, such as basophils and
mast cells (3-5). It was originally approved for the treat

ment of moderate-to-severe persistent allergic asthma
(6, 7), and later in 2014, for the treatment of CSU (6,
8). Several randomized clinical trials have confirmed its
efficacy and safety for the treatment of CSU, showing
significant reductions in the signs and symptoms of the
disease compared with placebo (9-11). It also constitutes the first drug approved for patients with CSU who
remain symptomatic despite H1-antihistamine treatment.
Nonetheless, approximately 41-48% of patients seen
in clinical trials (9-11) and 17-23% in the real-world
clinical setting (12-14) do not exhibit a complete or
significant response to omalizumab therapy. Given this
response rate and the expense associated with its use, the
identification of biomarkers predicting responsiveness to
this treatment in CSU would prove valuable in routine
clinical practice.

Furthermore, the mechanisms by which omalizumab
might achieve its therapeutic effects on patients with
CSU are not completely understood (4, 15). In allergic
rhinitis and asthma it has been shown that omalizumab
has the ability to reduce free IgE serum levels and consequently down-regulate FceRI receptors on basophils,
thereby preventing the release of inflammatory mediators
that cause allergic signs and symptoms (2, 3, 16-18).
However, to our knowledge, this mechanism of action
has not been assessed in CSU. Hence, we sought to
investigate the effect of omalizumab on basophil expression of FceRI receptor in a cohort of patients with
active CSU, and its possible association with the clinical
response. Moreover, we evaluated the basophil FceRI
receptor expression as a potential predictor of response
to omalizumab therapy.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Subjects and study design

Consecutive adult patients controlled at the Urticaria Clinic of the
Department of Dermatology of Hospital del Mar (Barcelona) with
moderate-to-severe persistent and active CSU (7-days Urticaria
Activity Score [UAS7] =16 (2)) and refractory to antihistamine
therapy were included in the study during the period from January
2014 to December 2015. Following a systematized prospective
protocol, treatment with omalizumab 300 mg was administered

every 4 weeks. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from
these patients prior to the 1‘ (baseline), 2", 3", 6" and 12" injections. Exclusion criteria for study participation were: <18 years
of age; concomitant treatment with oral corticosteroids and/or
other immunosuppressive agents; and suffer a chronic pruritic
disease besides CSU (in order to avoid potential interferences on
evaluated clinical scores). In addition, peripheral blood samples
from a control group of healthy adult volunteers without family
and personal history of allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, chronic
urticaria and atopic dermatitis were also evaluated. The local
Clinical Research Ethics Committee granted ethical approval for
the study (approval no. 2012/4913/I).

Clinical variables

Clinical variables were evaluated using the following patientreported outcomes (PROs) (2, 19, 20): Urticaria Activity Score
(UAS; UAS7 is a composite score of itch severity and hive count
over 7 days; range 0-42) and Urticaria Control Test (UCT, a validated tool for assessing disease control in routine clinical practice;
range 0-16). Response to therapy was assessed at 6 months of
treatment and was defined as an improvement in the patients’
signs and symptoms achieving UAS7 <6 or >90% reduction in
the UAS7 (1, 21, 22).

Basophil cell preparation and flow cytometry

Two independent researchers evaluated the levels of basophil
FceRI receptor and the PROs. FceRI receptor expression on basophils was measured by flow cytometry from peripheral blood
samples obtained from patients with CSU on day 0 and on weeks
4, 8, 20 and 44 of treatment, and from healthy controls (HCs). Flow
cytometry analysis was performed following standard procedures.
Briefly, 150 ul anticoagulated blood was incubated on the same
day of collection during 20 min at 4°C, with an excess of human
immunoglobulins to block unspecific binding. Afterwards, blood
was stained with either anti-CD123-PE (BD) or anti-CD193-APC
(Miltenyi) to identify basophils and with anti-FceR 1a-FITC (clone
CRA1, Ebiosciences) or an isotype control to establish the expression of FceRI on the surface of blood basophils. After incubation,
red blood cells were lysed with a hypotonic solution and samples
were analysed by flow cytometry using the FACSDiva software. At
least 2 x 10° events were acquired. Gating strategy is represented
in Fig. 1. Levels of basophil FceRI receptor are expressed as mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI).

Statistical analysis

All analyses were carried out with SPSS 21.0 statistical package.
Descriptive statistics were performed for each variable, using

variables, and absolute (7) and relative (%) frequencies for categorical variables. y? test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to
compare the demographic characteristics and the baseline FceRI
receptor expression between patients with CSU and HCs. Pearson’s
correlation was used to evaluate the association of the FceRI
receptor expression with serum IgE levels and blood basophil
count. Friedman test was used to detect differences over time in
the FceRI receptor expression, UAS7 and UCT during omalizumab
therapy. Post-hoc comparisons were performed using Wilcoxon
test, and p-values were adjusted using the Bonferroni correction.
A mixed linear model was applied to compare the FceRI receptor
expression between responder and non-responder patients (subjects as random effects, weeks of treatment as fixed effects). A
receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used
to evaluate the baseline FceRI receptor expression as a potential
predictor of response to omalizumab therapy. A p-value <0.05
was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS

Demographics

A total of 91 subjects, 47 patients with active CSU and
44 HCs, were enrolled in this single-centre study. In the
control group, the median (P25—P75) age was 45 years
(range 33-59) , and 34 out of 44 (77.3%) were women.
Demographic and clinical features of CSU group are
summarized in Table I. The median (P25—P75) age in
this population was 51 years (range 41—64) and there
were 37 women (78.7%) and 10 men (21.3%). After 6
months of treatment, 38 out of 47 patients (80.9%) with
CSU achieved significant clinical improvement and
were classified as “responders” (median value of UAS7
and UCT at 6 months: 0 and 14, respectively), and the
remaining 9 (19.1%) as “non-responders” (median value
of UAS7 and UCT at 6 months: 23 and 2, respectively).
Despite responder patients presented higher total IgE
levels at baseline (»=0.0003) and a lower rate of positive autologous serum skin test (»=0.022), both groups
showed the typical features of “classic” CSU (Table I).
At 12 months of treatment, responder patients showed a
satisfactory continued clinical response (median value
of UAS7 and UCT at 12 months: 2 and 13, respectively),
whereas non-responders did not exhibit significant improvement in CSU symptoms (median value of UAS7
and UCT at 12 months: 26 and 6, respectively).

Baseline FceRI receptor expression in patients with
chronic spontaneous urticaria and healthy controls

The median (P25—P75) expression of the basophil FceRI
receptor at baseline was significantly higher in patients
with CSU compared with the HC group (11,430 [7,600—
16,259] and 4,743 [2,770—7,406] of MFI, respectively)
(p<0.0001) (Fig. 2a). However, the median [P25—P75]
expression at baseline in non-responder patients (577
[493-705] of MFI) was significantly lower than in re

Effect of omalizumab on basophil FceRI receptor
expression

The evolution of the basophil FceRI receptor expression, UAS7 and UCT values during the 12 months of
treatment of the 47 patients with CSU is shown in Fig.
S1'. Overall, a significant sharp drop in the basophil
FceRI receptor expression was observed after the first
dose of omalizumab (median [P25—P75] reduction from
baseline at 4 weeks: 88.1% [80.9—90.7]; p<0.0001) (Fig.
Sla'). This trend was maintained throughout the whole
treatment (median reduction from baseline at weeks 8,
20 and 44: 91.0% in all cases). A similar evolution was
observed for the values of UAS7 (median reduction from
baseline at weeks 4, 8, 20 and 44: 90.6%, 87.4%, 88.2%
and 91.4%, respectively) and UCT (median increase
from baseline at weeks 4, 8, 20 and 44: 78.6%, 78.5%,
77.5% and 75.0%, respectively) (Fig. S1b'). A significant
association was found between such a reduction in the
FceRI receptor expression and the clinical improvement
observed during the therapy (p<0.0001).

The kinetic of omalizumab-induced reduction in the
FceRI receptor expression on blood basophils in responder and non-responder patients is shown in Fig. 3a. This
kinetic was significantly different between these 2 subgroups, with a lower reduction in non-responders at all
time points (median reduction from baseline at weeks 4,
8, 20 and 44: 57.4% vs. 89.2%; 35.3% vs. 91.9%; 35.7%
vs. 92.2%; 11.9% vs. 91.8%; respectively) (p<0.0001).
Furthermore, a different evolution was also observed for
the values of UAS7 (p<0.0001) and UCT (p<0.0001)
between responders and non-responders (Fig. 3b—c),

FceRI receptor expression, serum IgE levels and blood
basophil count

Finally, we investigated whether basophil FceRI receptor expression could be associated with total serum IgE
levels and/or blood basophil count, all of them assessed
at baseline. A positive correlation was found between IgE
levels (median [P25—P75]: 116 [42—277] kU/l) and the
FceRI receptor expression (R=0.573; p<0.001). Conversely, no association was detected between blood basophil
count (median [P25—P75]: 0.032 [0.015—0.065] x 10°/
ul) and FceRI receptor expression (R=0.199; p=0.18).

DISCUSSION

Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds selectively to human IgE on its Fe domain (6). By this
binding, the interaction between IgE and its high (FceRI)
and low (CD23) affinity receptor is blocked. It has been
demonstrated that activation of the FceRI receptor,
which is located on the surface of basophils, mast cells
and antigen-presenting cells, plays an essential role in
immediate-type hypersensitivity and allergic diseases
(16, 17, 23, 24). Furthermore, genetic variability in its
a and B subunits has been associated with increased IgE
levels and the presence of atopic features (25, 26). Previous data have also demonstrated a positive correlation
between FceRI receptor expression on inflammatory cells
and serum IgE levels ina variety of disease states, such as
asthma, atopic dermatitis and hyper-IgE syndrome (27).
Similarly, this association also appears to be applicable
to CSU, as demonstrated by our results. However, considering that CSU is not a classic allergen-driven disease,
other factors might also have a significant influence on
FceRI receptor expression. An interesting finding from
our study is the difference in the baseline expression of
basophil FceRI receptor between patients with CSU and
HCs. Likewise, Metz et al. (28) found higher baseline
levels of FceRI positive cells on cutaneous biopsies from
patients with CSU compared with healthy subjects. These
results, therefore, would reflect the increased reactivity
of inflammatory cells observed in subjects with active
CSU, as a higher FceRI receptor expression would make
those cells more sensitive to the stimulation by incoming
triggers (5).

In patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma, clinical
improvement during treatment with omalizumab has
been related to a reduction in free IgE serum levels,
and consequently, in the FceRI receptor expression on
the immune effector cells surface, as IgE-free FceRI
is structurally unstable and becomes internalized and
degraded (23, 29). This would lead to a reduction in the
FceRI-mediated production of inflammatory cytokines

www.medicaljournals.se/acta

and chemokines (3, 16, 17, 24). Hence, this therapeutic
down-regulation represents a unique molecular target
whereby both the sensitization and the effector phases of
the allergen-specific immune response could be inhibited
(29). The fast in vivo onset of action of omalizumab in
the treatment of these allergic diseases could also be
explained by this mechanism. In this sense, Lin et al.
(16) observed a rapidly inhibited ragweed-induced nasal
response in patients with allergic rhinitis within the first
7-14 days of treatment, which was associated with a
marked reduction (96%) in free IgE serum levels within
3 days and in the basophil FceRI receptor expression
within 14 days (70%). In CSU, however, this mechanism
of action has not been extensively evaluated. Previously,
Saavedra & Sur (30) reported a female patient with
CSU who was treated successfully with omalizumab
with a clear reduction (80%) in basophil FceRI receptor
expression after 14 days that was maintained throughout
the duration of the treatment. In the present study we
confirmed this assumption, and we found that the rapid
clinical improvement assessed through the PROs (UAS7
and UCT) was associated with a rapid and sharp reduction in basophil FceRI receptor expression within the
first 4 weeks of therapy. In addition to our study on blood
basophils, other investigations have evaluated the kinetic
of omalizumab-induced reduction in FceRI receptor expression on skin mast cells from patients with CSU, and
it seems that the time course for such down-regulation
is slower on the tissue. Thus, levels of FceRI positive
skin cells in patients with CSU could decline to levels
seen in healthy subjects after 12 weeks of treatment (28).

Because CSU represents a complex and multifactorial disease, it seems reasonable to think that a unique
pharmacological mechanism could not fully explain
the pattern of symptom improvement observed with
omalizumab therapy. Some additional mechanisms of
action have been proposed, including reversing basopaenia and improving basophil FceRI receptor sensitivity
to allergen-driven secretion (18, 31), alteration of the
expression of genes associated with mast cell/leukocyte infiltration, oxidative stress, vascularization and
skin repair events’, reducing mast cell releasability (2,
32), or reducing the activity of IgG autoantibodies by
lowering the levels of available surface IgE and FceRI
receptor (27), among others. Thereby, given that subsets
of patients with CSU may have different disease aetiopathogenesis, the combination of more than one of the
aforementioned mechanisms may explain the complete
involvement of omalizumab in relieving symptoms associated with CSU (33).

Availability of reliable biomarkers of therapeutic
response to different drugs in chronic diseases such as
CSU might have an important impact in routine clinical
practice. In this sense, for example, cyclosporine-treated
CSU patients with a positive serum Basophil Histamine
Release Assay (BHRA) showed higher rates of treatment
response compared with those patients with negative
BHRA (34). More recently, in a retrospective study of 41
patients with CSU the assessment of basophil CD203cupregulating activity, which is thought to reflect the
presence of autoantibodies to IgE and/or FceRI receptor
in the serum of patients with CSU, has been found to
be associated with the clinical response to omalizumab
(35). However, none of these biomarkers are currently
validated for their use in clinical practice.

In the present study we observed that baseline expression of basophil FceRI receptor may represent a potential
predictor of response to treatment with omalizumab in
CSU. In fact, all patients who did not achieve clinical
improvement with omalizumab had significantly lower
baseline levels of basophil FceRI receptor (and therefore a deficient down-regulation with the treatment) in
comparison with responder patients, which would be
the most likely explanation for the non-responder status.
The reason why these patients show almost undetectable
levels of basophil FceRI receptor is not yet fully understood. Genetic variability in the FcsRI receptor could be
a plausible explanation, since recent studies have shown
that experimental molecular changes in the subunits of
this receptor can affect its expression on the cell surface
(36). Other authors have also observed basopaenia in
patients with more active CSU disease (37, 38), which
reflects the recruitment of basophils to skin tissue and
might lead to decreased expression of FceRI receptor
on peripheral blood. However, in our cohort we did
not find differences regarding the blood basophil count
between responders and non-responders. Therefore, the
practical value of basophil FceRI receptor expression as
a clinically useful biomarker of omalizumab therapeutic response should be confirmed in future multicentre
prospective studies. This fact would allow physicians
to early identify patients who will not benefit from this
treatment. In addition, it should be taken into consideration that the results of FceRI receptor expression assessed by flow cytometry could vary depending on the
study population and technical issues. However, using
reference data from a control group of healthy subjects
would allow more accurate evaluation of the levels of
this receptor in patients with CSU.

Although responder patients showed higher baseline
total IgE levels in comparison with non-responders, there
are not enough arguments to believe in the assessment
of total IgE as a good therapeutic predictor in CSU.
This is due to the wide range (and therefore overlap)
of IgE values observed in responders (16-683 kU/I)
and non-responders (1—100 kU/I). Thus, approximately

 

Basophil FceRI expression and omalizumab in CSU 703

37% (14/38) of the patients showing satisfactory clinical
improvement with omalizumab had baseline total IgE
levels within the range observed in non-responders.
Furthermore, no predictive value has been found with
this biomarker in other allergic diseases (39).

In summary, although further investigations are needed
to fully understand the mechanism of efficacy of omalizumab in CSU, our study highlights the importance of
the down-regulation of basophil FceRI receptor expression in this process. Basophil FceRI receptor expression
holds promise as a clinically useful biomarker predicting
response to omalizumab therapy. Thereby, low baseline
levels would identify a special phenotype of CSU predicting a poor therapeutic response. While additional
research should be conducted to further document these
observations, the results of this study would have an important impact in the management of CSU and contribute
to understanding the clinical utility and mechanism of
action of anti-IgE therapy.
