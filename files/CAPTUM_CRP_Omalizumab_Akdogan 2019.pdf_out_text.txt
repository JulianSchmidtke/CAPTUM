of peripheral blood cells(lymphocyte, monocyte, neutrophil [PPBN], eosinophil, basophil [PPBB]) and sCRP were recorded at baseline, 3rd, 6th, 12th months of omalizumab
treatment. Although a dramatic increase in the mean PPBB (+SD) was observed at the
3rd month, PPBB (%) gradually decreased after the 3rd month (PPBB: 0.38 + 0.21
[baseline] vs. 0.59 + 0.3 [3rd month], p = .002). However, 12th month PPBB remained
higher than baseline (PPBB:0.38 + 0.21 [baseline] vs. 0.46+0.27 [12th month],
p = .03). A dramatic decrease in the mean PPBN (%) was noticed within the first
3 months (PPBN:62.85 + 8.97 [baseline] vs. 58.37 + 9.07 [3rd month], p = .04), and
12th month PPBN remained lower than baseline values (PPBN: 62.85 + 8.97 [baseline]
vs. 60.31 + 8.02 [12th month], p = .045).Mean sCRP (mg/dL) decreased rapidly within
the first 3 months (sCRP: 1.09 + 1.53 [baseline] vs. 0.56 + 0.45 [3rd month], p = .17)
and 12th month sCRP still remained lower than baseline levels (sCRP: 1.09 + 1.53
[baseline] vs. 0.83 + 1.06 [12th month], p = .01). Omalizumab substantially increases
PPBB,and reduces PPBN accompanied by a reduction in sCRP especially in the first
3 months; however, these effects may continue in the long-term. The alterations in
peripheral blood cell ratios and sCRP may contribute to the therapeutic effect of
omalizumab in CSU.

the years 2002 and 2013, respectively in Italy. Although various etiological factors have been related with the development of CSU, in
most cases the exact cause is still not completely known. However,
inflammation and coagulation are considered the main factors related
with the disease pathogenesis.

Even if CSU is generally not a life-threatening disease, it leads disability, impairment in quality of life, heavy economic burden, and is
associated with difficulties in the management of disease despite
availability of several therapeutic approaches. Second-generation antihistamines at permitted doses remain the first-line treatment option
for the treatment of CSU. Omalizumab is suggested as an add-on
third-line therapy option by urticaria guidelines to CSU patients with
inadequate response to fourfold doses of second-generation antihistamines (Zuberbier et al., 2018). Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to free IgE, and
subsequently decreases serum levels of IgE and the number of highaffinity IgE receptors on mast cells, basophils and dendritic cells
(Jackson & Callen, 2018). Changes in mast cell degranulation, decrease
in serum interleukin-31 levels, reversing basopenia, correction of the
basophil IgE receptor functions, alterations in coagulation parameters
are proposed effector mechanisms of omalizumab being involved in
the pathogenesis of CSU (Kaplan, Giménez-Arnau, & Saini, 2017). A
recent study revealed the significant effect of omalizumab on hematological parameters at the 3rd month of treatment compared with
baseline parameters (Acer, Kaya Erdogan, Yiiksel Canak¢l, &
Saracoglu, 2018). The authors postulated that omalizumab has not
only anti IgE effect, but also it may have effects on hematological
parameters that may contribute to the therapeutic effect. However,
the long-term effect of omalizumab on peripheral blood cell counts
and inflammatory markers is not very well-understood.

C-reactive protein (CRP), a sensitive inflammation marker, is
shown to be correlated with disease activity, impact, and response to
antihistamine therapy in CSU in a recent study (Kolkhir, Altrichter,
Hawro, & Maurer, 2018). Furthermore, guidelines recommend to evaluate serum CRP levels in all patients with CU for diagnosis as well as
differential diagnosis (Zuberbier et al., 2018). Another study has found
out the significant lowering effect of omalizumab on serum CRP levels
in 106 patients with CSU at the 3rd month of treatment compared
with baseline levels (Acer et al., 2018). However, it is not clarified
whether the lowering effect of omalizumab on serum CRP levels persist in patients with CSU in long-term. Thus, the aim of this study was
to determine the long-term effect of omalizumab on peripheral blood

cells and serum CRP levels during 1-year follow-up.

2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data of 74 patients who were older than 18 years were reviewed
from medical charts. All of the patients were on follow-up for CSU at
Hacettepe University hospital between 2016 and 2018. Exclusion
criteria consisted of presence of active/chronic infection, malignancy,
hematologic disease, autoinflammatory disease, association of other

inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing

spondylitis, and history of urticarial syndrome or urticarial vasculitis.
All patients were treated with 300 mg of subcutaneous omalizumab
continuously every 28 days for at least 1 year. Leukocyte count, percentages of peripheral blood cells (lymphocyte, monocyte, neutrophil
[PPBN], eosinophil, basophil [PPBB]) and serum CRP levels were evaluated at baseline and at 3rd, 6th, and 12th months of omalizumab
treatment. Demographic data, including age, gender, personal and

family medical history, and disease duration were reviewed.

2.1 | Statistical analyses and ethics committee
approval

Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for
Windows v.21.0. (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Data is presented as
mean + standard deviation (SD) or median (range) as appropriate. The
Shapiro-Wilk test was used to decide the normality of the distribution
of numeric variables. Demographic features of the study population
were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Categorical variables were
described with frequencies and percentages. Non-parametric tests
including the Friedman's test and the Wilcoxon Signed-rank test were
used to compare consecutive data including baseline, 3rd, 6th, and
12th month leukocyte count, percentage of peripheral blood cells and
serum CRP levels. The level of statistical significance was accepted
at p< .05.

The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Review Board
at the Hacettepe University Medical School with the code of GO17/839-26 on October 24, 2017. All procedures performed in the
study were in accordance with the ethical principles of the 1964

Helsinki declaration.

3 | RESULTS

Seventy-four patients (male/female: 20/54) were included in this
study with a median age of 43.3 years (20-78) and median disease
duration of 64.8 months (12-276 months). Data including mean
leucocyte counts, percentage of peripheral blood cells including lymphocyte, monocyte, neutrophil, eosinophil, basophil and serum
CRP levels during omalizumab treatment are presented in Table 1.
29.7% of the 74 patients (n = 22) exhibited basopenia (mean + SD:
0.38 + 0.21), while 25.7% (n = 19) of the patients had high serum CRP
levels (mean + SD: 1.09 + 1.53) at the beginning of omalizumab treatment. Even though a dramatic increase in the PPBB (mean + SD) was
observed during the first 3 months of omalizumab therapy (baseline
vs. 3rd month: 0.38 + 0.21 vs. 0.59 + 0.3, p = .002), PPBB decreased
gradually after the 3rd month until the end of 1 year follow-up. However, PPBB (mean + SD) still remained higher than baseline values at
12th month (baseline vs. 12th month: 0.38 + 0.21 vs. 0.46 + 0.27,
p = .03, Figure 1a). A dramatic decrease in the PPBN (mean + SD) was
noticed within the first 3 months (baseline vs. 3rd month: 62.85 + 8.97
vs. 58.37 + 9.07, p = .04), and PPBN values of 12th month still remained
lower than baseline values (baseline vs. 12th month: 62.85 + 8.97
vs. 60.31 + 8.02, p =.045, Figure 1b). Serum CRP levels decreased

4 | DISCUSSION

Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against
IgE used as an add-on therapy for patients with CSU refractory to high
doses of oral antihistamine therapy. It was originally accepted for the

treatment of allergic asthma refractory to conventional treatments (Xolair

US prescribing information, 2018). In CSU, omalizumab prevents
angioedema development, enhances quality of life, and is proposed as a
favorable drug for long-term use even after discontinuation (Zuberbier
et al., 2018). However, its mechanism of action in CSU is not very wellknown yet. Omalizumab can bind to free IgE and subsequently inhibits IgE
binding to Fc€RI on basophils, mast cells as well as dendritic cells which
may cause down-regulation of mast cell pool, IgE pool, and a decrease in
amplification of mast cells (Chang et al., 2015). Additionally, the drug can
decrease Fc€RII on B cells and may lead a reduction in the formation of
IgE-secreting plasma cells. Thus, the overall effect of omalizumab is the
inhibition of allergens to activate basophils, mast cells, and their subsequent release of proinflammatory cytokines, and eventually it depletes the

overall inflammatory state in the body (Chang et al., 2015).

Recent studies have shown that patients with CSU have basopenia
reflecting the role of basophils in the pathogenesis of CSU. Metz et al.
(2017) revealed that mean levels of basophils are low in untreated
CSU patients, and omalizumab increases peripheral blood basophil
numbers compared with placebo early in the first 2 weeks although
basophil levels returned almost near to patients’ baseline values by
20 week-follow-up. Saini et al. (2017) postulated that circulating blood
basophils increased in response to treatment with omalizumab
300 mg, and the authors added that the clinical improvement detected
with omalizumab treatment may be linked to its effect on basophils.
Grattan CE stated that circulating basophils may be recruited from
blood into urticarial wheals during disease activity and those with the
most severe symptoms have the lowest count of basophils (Grattan,
Dawn, Gibbs, & Francis, 2003). In the present study, the authors demonstrated that almost one-third of patients had apparent basopenia,
and mean PPBB was near to the lower limits of normal ranges of
PPBBs at the beginning of omalizumab therapy. In accordance with
the literature, this study showed the obvious booster effect of
omalizumab in PPBBs early in the first months. Although fluctuations
in the PPBB was noticed after the 3rd month, a significant increase in
PPBBs was observed at the end of 12th month compared to baseline
values. This observation supports the reversing effect of omalizumab
on basopenia in patients with CSU even in the late periods.

Numerous studies have established that patients with CSU may
have elevated serum CRP levels, and CRP has been proposed to be a

possible marker of disease activity, severity, and response to

treatments particularly oral antihistamines in CSU (Kolkhir et al., 2018).
A study from Tunisia demonstrated a linear positive correlation
between serum CRP levels and urticaria activity scores, and the
authors revealed that the anti-inflammatory effects of desloratadine
was correlated with serum CRP levels in CSU patients (Maouia et al.,
2017). Ohtsuka (2010) found out that the elevated high sensitivityCRP levels showed good response to oral cyclosporine therapy in CSU.
Kolkhir, Pogorelov, and Olisova (2017) found that elevation of serum
CRP levels is associated with more active disease, low quality of life,
and lack of response to standard doses of levocetirizine in CSU. A
recent study from Turkey pointed a significant decrease in serum CRP.
levels with omalizumab in the 3rd month compared with baseline
values (Acer et al., 2018). However, the long-term effect of
omalizumab on serum CRP levels is not studied in patients with CSU.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to assess the set of serum
CRP levels in CSU patients treated with omalizumab in a long-term
period. In the present study, almost one quarter of study patients had
elevated serum CRP levels, and mean serum CRP levels of all patients
was slightly higher than normal limits at the beginning of treatment. A
dramatic decline in the serum CRP levels was noticed during the first
3 months of omalizumab therapy in this study. Although mean serum
CRP levels increased slightly after the 3rd month, the mean levels
remained significantly lower at the 12th month of omalizumab therapy
compared with the baseline values. Omalizumab exerted antiinflammatory effects on CSU patients revealed by serum CRP levels.

The assessment of CRP levels may help to optimize the management
AKDOGAN er at.

 

of CSU patients with omalizumab. Although the most obvious reducing
effect of the drug is seen in the 3rd month, this effect continues until
the end of 1 year according to the relevant study findings.

Even though the anti-inflammatory role of omalizumab on inflammatory cells including mast cells, basophils, and dendritic cells is discussed until now, the impact of the drug on neutrophils is an enigma.
However, the infiltration of urticaria lesions by neutrophils mainly in
the early lesions has already been shown (Kaplan & Greaves, 2009).
Furthermore, “neutrophilic urticaria” is a term used to define a few of
urticarial lesions showing predominantly neutrophilic infiltrate on histological examination which reflects a pathway that may be less
dependent on mast-cell degranulation contrarily to classical urticaria
(Winkelmann & Reizner, 1988). Ong revealed the priming effect of
repeated allergen challenge on infiltration of neutrophil in asthmatic
bronchial biopsies in patients on placebo that was abrogated in those
receiving omalizumab (Ong et al., 2005). Yalcin found out the
diminishing effect of omalizumab on peripheral blood neutrophils,
eosinophils, macrophages, serum IgE, and IL-4 levels in 10 patients
with asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome in 12 months of treatment reflecting the possible role of
omalizumab on neutrophilic inflammation as well as its efficacy
against Th2-mediated eosinophilic asthma (Yalcin, Celik, & Yalcin,
2016). However, the effects of omalizumab on peripheral blood and
tissue neutrophil number in CSU is not elucidated yet. A study found
out the diminishing effect of omalizumab on peripheral blood neutrophil count in CSU patients on the 3rd month; but long-term outcome
is not assessed. The present study assessed the 1-year outcome of
omalizumab in CSU patients reflecting a reduction in the PPBN at the
end of 1-year follow-up. Omalizumab may reduce recruitment and
activation of neutrophils, and probably other inflammatory cells via
inhibiting T-helper cells type-2 immune response and may be used to
decrease urticaria activity in CSU patients by this way. However, the
lack of tissue sampling from urticarial lesions in order to characterize
the distribution of neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils is a limitation of
this study.

The main limitations of this study are its retrospective design and
the absence of tissue sampling for histopathological examination in
order to compare results with blood counts. The determination of
treatment response according to the relevant parameters and the
inadequate data concerning demographical features, medical, and
family history are other issues. Since the study was performed at a
single center, generalization of the study results to the entire population might be a challenge. Whether the altered values may return to
the baseline values after the cessation of omalizumab therapy is also
problematic.

In conclusion, there is now a strong body of evidence indicating
that omalizumab inhibits and changes multiple key components of the
allergic inflammatory cascade in CSU. Omalizumab substantially
increases the ratio of peripheral blood basophils, and reduces the ratio
of peripheral blood neutrophils accompanied by a reduction in serum
CRP levels. Although the remarkable effect of omalizumab was
detected early in the first 3 months, these effects may persist in long
term even in 1-year follow-up. Perhaps, the decreased ratio of blood

es -WiLeyt +

neutrophil in counter may lead to a shift in the direction of increase in
the ratio of blood basophil. Although no correlation was found
between serum CRP levels and PPBN at 3rd month of omalizumab
therapy both of which decreased prominently, different studies
should be done to clarify the relationship between serum CRP and
PPBN, and the factors affecting them. The alterations in peripheral
blood cell ratios and serum CRP levels may contribute to the therapeutic effect of omalizumab in CSU. Prospective studies are needed
to test CRP, and peripheral blood basophil and neutrophil ratio for
their use as a biomarker in the management of CSU patients with

omalizumab.
