Received for publication October 25, 2014.
Received in revised form January 14, 2015.
Accepted for publication February 4, 2015.

Background: There is no specific International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD9-CM) code for chronic idiopathic urticaria or spontaneous urticaria (CIU/CSU), a skin condition characterized by
hives and angioedema lasting at least 6 weeks with no known cause.
Objective: To validate an ICD-9-CM—based algorithm for identification of patients with CIU/CSU and thus
facilitate claims-based research.
Methods: Patient records were reviewed at 4 US practices. Patients included in the study were from a random
sample of those identified by their physician as having CIU/CSU or because they met the following diagnosis-based
algorithm: (1) at least 2 outpatient ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes 708.1, 708.8, or 708.9 at least 6 weeks apart or (2) 1
outpatient diagnosis of 708.1, 708.8, or 708.9 and 1 diagnosis of 995.1 at least 6 weeks apart. Data collected
included ICD-9-CM codes, diagnoses of urticaria and allergy-related conditions, and medication use. Sensitivity
and positive predictive value were calculated. The study was approved by the Western Institutional Review Board.
Results: One hundred forty-nine patient records were reviewed (mean age 41.1 years; 73.8% were women;
69.1% were white): 115 were identified with the diagnosis-based algorithm, 90 were patients with “known
CIU/CSU”, and 56 were in the 2 groups. The mean duration of CIU/CSU was 2.9 to 3.1 years. The 2 cohorts
most frequently had diagnoses of idiopathic urticaria, unspecified urticaria, and other specified urticaria. The
diagnosis-based algorithm had a positive predictive value of 90.4% and a sensitivity of 71.1%.
Conclusion: The high positive predictive value suggests that patients identified using the algorithm are highly
likely to have CIU/CSU. The 71.1% sensitivity suggests that most patients with CIU/CSU will be identified. The
validation statistics support the use of the diagnosis-based algorithm in claims-based research, although
future studies could refine the algorithm further.

examined epidemiology, treatment patterns, or burden of
illness,®:° which includes the effects of comorbidity, health care
costs, and use. This could be because CIU/CSU is difficult to
assess in the general population and a lack of an International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
(ICD-9-CM) diagnosis code for CIU/CSU limits secondary data
analyses. One study used health insurance claims to describe
patterns of health service use in CIU/CSU.'* These findings were
consistent with prior results,2*°!°!° but the ICD-9-CM algorithms used to identify patients with CIU/CSU had not been
validated, potentially limiting the reliability of the findings.

To enable accurate research using administrative claims, a
multicenter chart review was conducted to validate and revise the
previously used ICD-9-CM—based algorithms that could be used to
identify patients with CIU/CSU. Then, the resulting algorithms were
tested in an insurance claims database.

Methods
Study Design and Setting

A retrospective review of patients’ medical and billing records
was conducted at 4 specialized asthma and allergy centers in the
United States, with a large volume of CIU/CSU, a wide variety of
practice settings, and different geographic regions. The ICD-9-CM
algorithm also was tested in an insurance claims database. The
Western Institutional Review Board (www.wirb.com) approved the
study (protocol 1140461).

Patient Population

Chart review included a random sample of patients who (1)
met an ICD-9-CM code algorithm or (2) were identified by their
physician as having CIU/CSU. Patients in the algorithm positive
sample had 2 outpatient diagnoses of idiopathic urticaria (ICD9-CM code 708.1), other specified urticaria (708.8), or unspecified urticaria (708.9), with the 2 diagnoses at least 6 weeks
apart, or had 1 outpatient diagnosis of 708.1, 708.8, or 708.9 and
1 diagnosis of 995.1 (angioneurotic edema) at least 6 weeks
apart. The 6-week interval was used to avoid identifying patients with acute urticaria conditions that resolved in a short
period. Patients who did not have at least 1 visit to the study site
from January 1, 2010 through June 1, 2013 were excluded. The
goal was to achieve a relatively large sample size by including
150 eligible patients divided among the 4 centers. The algorithms were tested in a patient population selected from a
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant
administrative claims database, containing data on approximately 28 million patients.

Data Collection

Study abstractors (site clinical office staff) were trained in
screening charts and data entry. Data were collected using a
secure, Web-based application (http://www.project-redcap.org/;
supported by grant UL1TROO0011 from the National Center for
Advancing Translational Sciences at the National Institutes of
Health). Medical and billing record data were collected from
January 1, 2010 through June 1, 2013 for every patient. Medical
record data included demographics (age, sex, and race or
ethnicity), presence of angioedema, various urticaria conditions
(physical urticaria, contact urticaria, urticaria vasculitis, and
other urticaria conditions), allergy-related conditions (angioedema, asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, allergic purpura, and other allergy conditions), and medication use. Billing
record data included the use of ICD-9-CM codes 708.1 (idiopathic
urticaria), 708.2 (urticaria due to cold and heat), 708.3 (dermatographic urticaria), 708.4 (vibratory urticaria), 708.5 (cholinergic urticaria), 708.8 (other specified urticaria), 708.9 (urticaria,
unspecified), and 995.1 (angioneurotic edema).

Statistical Analysis

Validation statistics included positive predictive value (PPV) and
sensitivity. PPV is defined as the proportion of confirmed cases
(“true positives”) of all patients identified by a test (“test positives”).'° Sensitivity is defined as the proportion of patients
correctly identified by a test (“true positives”) in a group known to
have the condition (“condition positives”).'° PPV was calculated
only for patients from the algorithm positive sample (the “test
positives”), and sensitivity was calculated only for patients known
to have CIU/CSU (the “condition positives”). Descriptive statistics
summarizing the distribution of demographics, ICD-9-CM codes,
duration of CIU/CSU, urticaria conditions, allergy-related conditions, and medication use were reported. Missing data were not
imputed.

The main algorithm (‘“diagnosis-based algorithm”) had 2
components (Fig 1). The first component (“urticaria component”)
identified patients with at least 2 outpatient ICD-9-CM diagnoses
of urticaria (idiopathic, other specified, or unspecified) at least 6
weeks apart. The second component (“angioedema component”)
identified patients with 1 outpatient ICD-9-CM diagnosis of urticaria and 1 of angioedema at least 6 weeks apart. The algorithm
proposed by Zazzali et al'* had a third component that identified
people with 1 outpatient [CD-9-CM diagnosis of urticaria and an
overlapping supply of a prescription antihistamine and a second
antihistamine, montelukast, cyclosporine, methotrexate, or oral
corticosteroids. During initial testing for the present study using

claims data from 2013, there was a decrease in the proportion
of patients who filled a prescription for an antihistamine, from
68% in 2007 (the data used in the study by Zazzali et al'*) to
23% in 2013, which was attributed to the increased availability

of over-the-counter antihistamines. Accordingly, the medication
component was excluded from the first round of validation.
In exploratory analyses, the authors examined how the initial
validation statistics were affected by 4 changes to the main diagnosisbased algorithm. First, ICD-9-CM code 708.8 (other specified urticaria)
was eliminated. Second, the gap required between ICD-9-CM codes
was shortened from 6 to 4 weeks. Third, a new “diagnosis +
medication-based algorithm” was defined by allowing the use of
montelukast, cyclosporine, methotrexate, or oral corticosteroids to
substitute for a confirmatory urticaria or angioedema code. Fourth, the
effect of the diagnosis + medication-based algorithm was tested,
which required at least 90 days of use (vs any use) of one of the listed
medications.

The 2 best performing algorithms identified (main diagnosis-based
and diagnosis + medication-based) and the original algorithm
developed by Zazzali et al'* underwent further validation tests in the
claims database. The populations identified by each of these 3 algorithms were compared because, for the diagnosis + medication-based
algorithm and the algorithm developed by Zazzali et al,'? the chart
review sample was missing an unknown number of “test positive”
patients (because the algorithm used to identify patients would not
have identified all modified algorithm “test positive” patients).
Therefore, PPV could not be accurately estimated and further validation was conducted.

All data transformations and statistical analyses were performed
using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).

 

 

 

Results

One hundred fifty patient records were collected, 1 of which was
included based on an incorrect ICD-9-CM code. The final sample
consisted of 149 patients: 115 in the algorithm positive sample and
90 in the known CIU/CSU sample (56 were in the 2 samples). The
algorithm positive sample had a mean age of 41.0 years (SD 21.7)
and the known CIU/CSU sample had a mean age of 44.6 years (SD
17.6). Women constituted 74.8% of the algorithm positive group and
73.3% of the known CIU/CSU group. White patients constituted
70.4% of the algorithm positive group and 61.1% of the known CIU/
CSU group (Table 1).

The mean duration of CIU/CSU was nearly identical between the
cohorts: 3.1 years (SD 3.2; median 2.5) in the algorithm positive
sample vs 2.9 years (SD 3.3; median 2.3) in the known CIU/CSU
group. The distribution ICD-9-CM codes differed somewhat between groups, with slightly fewer patients in the algorithm positive
group being coded with idiopathic urticaria (54.8% vs 60.0%) and
unspecified urticaria (20.9% vs 25.6%). “Other” urticaria conditions
(eg, other than idiopathic, physical, or contact urticaria or urticaria
vasculitis) were less common in the algorithm positive sample
compared with the known CIU/CSU sample (19.1% vs 30%). Allergyrelated conditions were found in similar proportions between
groups, although atopic dermatitis was seen in 17.4% of the algorithm positive group compared with 5.6% of the known CIU/CSU
group.

The rank ordering of the most commonly used long-term
medications was similar between groups, with antihistamine
and oral corticosteroids most common in the 2 groups. H2
blockers, cyclosporine, and montelukast were the next most
commonly used medications, and doxepin, omalizumab, and
sulfasalazine were least commonly used (although the rank
order differed somewhat between groups). Epinephrine autoinjector was prescribed in approximately one third of cases
(Table 1).

Algorithm Development

In the algorithm positive sample (N = 115), there were 104 true
positives, for a PPV of 90.4%. The algorithm correctly identified 64 of

sensitivity of 71.1% (Table 2). The urticaria component alone had a
PPV of 90.3% and a sensitivity of 67.8% compared with a PPV of
88.2% and a sensitivity of 8.9% for the angioedema component
alone (not shown).

In exploratory analyses, the algorithms were modified and the
validation statistics were recalculated. Chart review was not performed on all patients meeting each definition, but only for those
meeting the main algorithm definition. Therefore, PPV could not be
calculated for the exploratory algorithms that were less restrictive
than the original (all but the first one). First, the elimination of the
“other specified urticaria” code increased the PPV of the diagnosisbased algorithm to 97.5% but decreased sensitivity to 56.7%. Second,
shortening the gap required between diagnoses codes from 6 to 4
weeks increased sensitivity to 76.7%. Third, the authors allowed any
use of montelukast, cyclosporine, methotrexate, or oral corticosteroids
to substitute for a confirmatory urticaria or angioedema code. This

diagnosis + medication-based algorithm had a sensitivity of 83.3%.
Fourth, requiring at least 90 days (rather than any) of use of 1 of the
listed medications resulted in sensitivity of 74.4% (Table 2, Fig 2).

Algorithm Testing

Only the diagnosis + medication algorithm showed a significant
sensitivity gain compared with the main diagnosis-based algorithm,
so the modifications were eliminated from further testing. The
diagnosis-based, diagnosis + medication-based, and original'? algorithms were tested in the claims database. Of a group of patients
continuously enrolled from January to December 2012, the diagnosisbased algorithm identified 6,350 patients and the diagnosis +
medication-based algorithm identified 29,913 patients as having CIU/
CSU, with 23,563 identified by the medication portion of the algorithm but not by the diagnosis-based portion. The original algorithm

main diagnosis-based algorithm.

Discussion

Despite the detrimental effects of CIU/CSU, the burden of this
skin condition is not well described. One possible reason is the lack
of a specific ICD-9-CM code for CIU/CSU, thus limiting the use of
insurance claims databases to conduct research in patients with this
condition. To fill this gap, the authors validated the previously used
ICD-9-CM-—based algorithms for the identification of patients with
CIU/CSU to allow for a variety research using commercial insurance
claims databases, including studies of treatment patterns and
disease epidemiology in patients with CIU/CSU.

The authors found that a diagnosis-based algorithm requiring at
least 1 urticaria code (ICD-9-CM code 708.1, 708.8, or 708.9) plus (1)
another of the same code or (2) a diagnosis of angioedema (995.1) at
least 6 weeks from the first code had a PPV of 90.4% and a sensitivity
of 71.1%.

The PPV expresses how likely patients identified with a given
test are to have the condition of interest. Overall, PPVs from 85% to
89% are considered acceptable, and PPVs from 70% to 75% are
considered moderate.'” A study of ICD-9-CM codes for 32 conditions
found a median PPV of 80.7%, a mean of 77%, and a range of 23% to
100%.'° High PPV algorithms are required in claims studies to reliably identify samples, such as in comparisons of different treatment
groups. The PPV of 90% reported for the present algorithm is
above the threshold considered “acceptable” and identifies a large
percentage of patients who are very likely to have CIU/CSU.

Sensitivity of ICD-9-CM algorithms is often less important than
PPV, because many claims studies are concerned with drawing a valid
sample from a large population, which is feasible with low sensitivity.
High sensitivity is important in the identification of the entire population (eg, to estimate disease prevalence). There are no agreed-to
standards for adequate sensitivity. In a study of more than 4,000
medical records, sensitivity of ICD-9-CM codes for chart reviewvalidated conditions ranged from 9% for weight loss to higher than
83% for metastatic cancer.'® The median value was 46% and the mean
was 49%, and in only 6 of 32 conditions was sensitivity above 70%. Two
other studies reported the sensitivity of ICD-9-CM codes for multiple
conditions and found similar ranges: Lee et al!° reported a range of
2.9% to 81.2%, with only 1 of 12 higher than 70%, and Quan et al?”
reported a range of 24.6% to 87.8%, with 6 of 17 higher than 70%.

Although the initial sensitivity result of 711% with the main
algorithm was higher than 70%, the authors attempted to improve it
with various modifications. Adding a medication-based component
increased sensitivity to 83.3%. However, in the claims-based portion
of the study, this modified algorithm identified almost 5 times as
many patients as the main one. Possibly, the revised algorithm
incorrectly included many patients without CIU/CSU, and the modest
increase in sensitivity came at the expense of a dramatic decrease in
specificity. Perhaps, medications prescribed for something other than
CIU/CSU (eg, allergy or asthma) are common in patients with a single
diagnosis of urticaria. Although a decrease in specificity cannot be
directly confirmed with the present study design, it can be inferred
because the main algorithm failed to identify only 28.9% (100% minus
sensitivity) of patients with CIU/CSU. It follows that any modification,
no matter how sensitive, should not find more than 30% of cases than
the main diagnosis-based algorithm.

In this chart study, 100% of patients with CIU/CSU had evidence
of antihistamine use (the records did not specify whether overthe-counter or prescription), yet an examination of recent
insurance claims found only 23% of patients with CIU/CSU had a
claim for a prescription antihistamine. The original algorithm
developed by Zazzali et al'* included a medication component
that relied on the use of antihistamines to identify patients. The

 

 

original algorithm identified only 100 more patients than the
6,350 with the main diagnosis-based algorithm, likely a result of
how antihistamines are obtained.

Thus, the authors propose 3 potential algorithms as virtually
identical in their ability to accurately identify patients with CIU/
CSU in insurance claims: the entire diagnosis-based algorithm (PPV
90.4%, sensitivity 71.1%), its urticaria component alone (2 codes of
708.1, 708.8, or 708.9 at >6 weeks apart; PPV 90.3%; sensitivity
67.8%), or the original algorithm (which adds some complexity and
identifies a minimally different patient population).

Strengths and Limitations

This is the first study to directly validate an ICD-9-CM algorithm
to identify patients with CIU/CSU. The study reports an algorithm
that can be used in administrative insurance claims-based studies
to identify patients who are very likely to have CIU/CSU and that the
algorithm will identify most patients with the condition. Limitations include a sample of fewer than 150 patients and the potential
non-representativeness of the coding practices at the 4 specialized
practices. For example, if CIU/CSU is typically coded using a
different combination of ICD-9 codes at other asthma and allergy
centers compared with the centers included in this study, then PPV
and sensitivity values would be affected.

The authors were unable to calculate the negative predictive value
and specificity because this study included only patients who met an
ICD-9 code algorithm (“test positive” patients) or were identified by
their physician as having CIU/CSU (“condition positive” patients). The
calculation of negative predictive value and specificity requires data
on patients without CIU/CSU (ie, “test negative” patients and “condition negative” patients), which this study did not collect.

Conclusion

A relatively simple 2-part algorithm can accurately identify patients with CIU/CSU. The diagnosis-based algorithm validated in this
study had 90.4% PPV and 71.1% sensitivity, suggesting that patients
identified with this algorithm are highly likely to have CIU/CSU and
that it will identify a reasonably large proportion of all cases. This
algorithm enables researchers to explore a vast array of epidemiology
and health services research topics using administrative insurance
claims databases to gain knowledge about CIU/CSU.
