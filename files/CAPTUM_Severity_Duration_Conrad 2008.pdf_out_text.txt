Introduction

Abstract

Background There is evidence that chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) and
psoriasis are associated with personality based difficulties in emotional
regulation particularly with regard to the feeling of anger. This deficit in
emotional awareness could lead to the phenomenon that emotions are rather
experienced in bodily symptoms such as pruritus.

Aim We investigated whether there is a relationship between pruritus as
major symptoms in CIU and psoriasis and the experience of negative emotions.
Setting Forty-one CIU patients and 44 psoriasis patients treated at Bonn
University Hospital and 49 healthy controls were included.

Method Patients and controls were compared on questionnaires measuring
alexithymia (TAS-20), emotional distress (SCL-90-R) and anger (STAXI). In
skin-disordered patients, separate stepwise regressions with pruritus severity as
dependent variable and questionnaires, skin status, duration, sex and age as
independent variables were calculated.

Results CIU and psoriasis patients showed higher alexithymia, emotional
distress, depression, anxiety and state anger compared with controls. State
anger was the only significant predictor of pruritus severity in CIU explaining
19% of variance. Depression was the only significant predictor of pruritus
severity in psoriasis explaining 12% of variance.

Conclusions Our findings suggest a relationship between pruritus severity
and anger in CIU. Furthermore, our results indicate a relationship between
pruritus severity and depression in psoriasis.

psychopathological symptoms in the development of CIU
has also been investigated in several studies. As far as

Despite a lot of research on the causes of chronic
idiopathic urticaria (CIU), the aetiology is still largely
unknown.' Recent studies suggest in a subgroup of
CIU patients autoimmune processes as _ significant
pathomechanisms. Thus, approximately one-third of
patients with CIU have autoantibodies against the
high-affinity IgE receptor or IgE in their blood.*?
However, it is not clear whether CIU with autoantibodies
can be classified as an autoimmune disease. The role
of psychological factors such as personality traits or

1062

psychopathological symptoms are concerned, patients
have been described as more anxious and depressed in
comparison with healthy controls or in comparison to
other dermatological patients.*” However, it is not clear
whether these symptoms are causes or consequences
of the disease. With regard to personality traits, several
studies found a difficulty in dealing with aggression/anger
in patients with CIU. These patients were not able to
adequately identify, express and communicate these
feelings.’ This difficulty in affect regulation is typical for

a personality trait described as alexithymia (literally:
no words for emotions), which means a deficit in identification and communication of emotions, and a recent
study found significantly higher alexithymia scores in
comparison with healthy controls in CIU.* Alexithymia in
skin-disordered patients is associated with higher
emotional distress and a wide range of psychopathology.’
It is assumed that the deficit in emotional awareness
might lead to the phenomenon that emotions are rather
experienced in bodily symptoms and physical actions." In
skin disorders, pruritus can be such a bodily symptom.'°
Assuming a pervasing emotion recognition deficit in
chronic urticaria, we think of certain similarities in personality structure to psoriasis patients. In this skin disorder,
a higher prevalence of alexithymia is connected with
difficulties in communicating anger.'''? The established
role of psychological factors including alexithymia and anger
in psoriasis patients provided the rationale for investigating
psoriasis patients as a comparison group in our study.
We wanted to investigate the following hypotheses:

Patients with CIU and psoriasis show higher alexithymia,
as well as emotional distress, depression and anxiety
compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, patients
in both skin disorders tend to be angry and have at
the same time difficulties in the expression of anger.
Provided that CIU and psoriasis patients show
difficulties in emotional regulation, we hypothesized
finally that a significant part of variance in pruritus
perception in both skin disorders can be explained by
negative affect such as anger and/or depression.

Method

Patients

Study method was approved by the local Ethics
Committee. We asked 55 consecutive inpatients from the
Department of Dermatology at Bonn University Hospital
with CIU without coexisting other form of urticaria (e.g.
physical urticaria) to take part in the study. Patients were
assigned to this urticarial subgroup after full clinical

assessment, physical challenge testing including tests for
dermatographism, heat and cold, vibration, contact with
water, pressure, exposure to light, exercise and skin
biopsies if indicated.'* Nine patients denied to take part
because of miscellanous reasons (not interested, poor
German language). Furthermore, 5 patients had to be
excluded from our final analysis because of incomplete
questionnaires. Thus, finally we could include 41
inpatients with CIU in our analysis.

This group was compared with a group of psoriasis
patients. We asked 52 consecutive psoriasis inpatients
from the Department of Dermatology at Bonn University
Hospital. Six patients denied to take part, because of
miscellanous reasons (not interested, no time) Furthermore,
2 patients had to be excluded because of incomplete
questionnaires.

Thirty-six psoriasis patients (82%) showed greater than
10% of affected body surface area,'* and 35 CIU patients
(85%) showed at least moderate pruritus and more than
20 wheals daily, which means the majority of patients
with psoriasis and CIU showed moderate to high severity
of disease.'*!° Table 1 gives a brief survey about duration
of illness, skin status and subjective assessment of pruritus
severity in patients with CIU and psoriasis.

Psoriasis patients showed a significantly longer duration of illness and a higher score concerning skin status
compared to CIU patients.

As a control group, we used a group of 49 age and gender matched healthy volunteers, which were recruited by
advertisements to take part in a psychological study. Only
volunteers without any current psychiatric or organic illness were included.

Sociodemographic characteristics of all three groups are
given in Table 2.

There were no significant differences between the three
groups with regard to sociodemographic characteristics.

Measures

Demographic variables were assessed with a general
checklist, assessing patients’ gender, age, marital status
and educational level.

The patients were asked to rate the severity of the
pruritus that they were experiencing at the time they
were completing the study questionnaire. The patients
with CIU and psoriasis rated the following items, respectively, on a 5-point scale: ‘Itching due to urticaria at the
present time’ or ‘Itching due to psoriasis at the present
time’. The 5-point scale consisted of a line with equal
sections. Each of the sections were labelled numerically
with a rating of ‘1’ denoting ‘not at all’ and a rating of ‘5’
denoting ‘very severe’.

Skin status was assessed with a 5-item scale, measuring
the degree to which five different parts of the body (face,
hairy scalp and neck, extremities, torso, genitals/anus)
were affected by the disease, with response categories
on a 4-point scale (0 = not; 1 =a little; 2 = moderately;
3 = strongly). A total score for the affected areas of the body
was calculated by adding up the scores of the five items.
Moreover, duration of the skin disorder was assessed.

Psychological distress and psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the German version'® of the
Symptom Checklist 90-R, SCL-90-R.'7 The Symptom
Checklist 90-R generates nine primary symptom dimensions (ie. somatization, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic
anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism) as well as a
sum score (Global Severity Index) measuring psychological distress. The Symptom Checklist 90-R is a reliable
measure and is reported to have adequate indices of
concurrent criterion orientated validity, as well as construct validity.

Alexithymia was measured dimensionally using the
German version of the Twenty-Item Toronto Alexithymia
Scale, TAS-20,'* which was originally developed by Bagby
and colleagues.!? The German version of the Toronto
Alexithymia Scale is a 20-item self-report instrument that

1064

has been shown to have good internal consistency [Cronbach’s alpha = 0.70 (sum value alexithymia)], good
reliability, as well as construct and criterion validity to
measure alexithymic characteristics.'*

State anger, trait anger and anger expression were
assessed by the German version’® of the State trait
anger expression inventory (STAXI).?! This measure
distinguishes state anger and trait anger, and further
distinguishes between the experience of anger and the
expression of anger. Subscales can be derived to assess
whether individuals tend to keep in their anger (anger-in),
or express their anger openly (anger-out), or whether
individuals effectively control and reduce their feelings of
anger (anger-control). This measure and its subscales have
been found to exhibit good psychometric properties.?°7!

Analysis

Descriptive statistics was given for clinical and
sociodemographic data as well as psychometric tests.
ANOVA, ANCOvA, t-tests and chi-squared tests were used
depending on scale level to analyse group differences. To
control for cumulative alpha error post hoc tests were
calculated according to Tukey. Correlations were calculated according to Pearson. Results with P < 0.05 were
regarded as significant. Finally, a stepwise multiple
regression analysis was calculated, which is described in
detail in the results section.

Results

First, we wanted to investigate the hypothesis that
controlling for depression patients with CIU and psoriasis
show higher alexithymia sum scores as measured by
the TAS-20 sum score compared with healthy controls

(hypothesis 1 (H1)). We controlled for depression because
alexithymia scores can be influenced by mood.’

Our hypothesis could be confirmed. CIU patients also
scored higher on all alexithymia subscales. Alexithymia
and duration of illness (CIU: r = 0.17; PSO: r = 0.28) showed
no significant association.

Second, we hypothesized that CIU patients and psoriasis patients show higher emotional distress, depression
and anxiety as measured by the SCL-90-R in comparison
with healthy controls (H2).

Hypothesis 2 could also be confirmed. Compared to
controls CIU patients and psoriasis patients showed elevated scores with regard to depression, anxiety and emotional distress as measured by the Global Severity Index.
Alexithymia sum score was significantly correlated with
emotional distress (CIU: r=0.45*, PSO: r= 0.42%, CO:

r = 0.57*) in both patient groups and in the control group
(*P < 0.05).

In the next step, we compared the three groups on the
STAXI. We hypothesized that CIU patients and psoriasis
patients show higher trait anger (H3) and state anger (H4)
as measured by the STAXI and that they show difficulties
with anger expression in the sense that they either tend
to keep their anger in (higher anger-in (H5)) or react
overaggressive [higher anger-out (H6)].

Hypotheses 4, 5 and 6 could be confirmed: CIU patients
and psoriasis patients showed higher state anger, anger-in
and anger-out compared to healthy controls. Hypothesis
3 could not be confirmed. Only psoriasis patients showed
significantly higher scores on the subscale trait anger.

anger (CIU: r=0.44*, PSO: r=0.14, CO: r=0.27) and

were only significant (*P < 0.05) in CIU patients.

Finally, we hypothesized that a significant part of variance in pruritus perception in CIU (H7) as well as in psoriasis
patients (H8) can be explained by negative affect such as
anger and/or depression. Thus, we calculated for both skin
disorders separate stepwise multiple regression analyses
using patient age, gender, skin status, duration of illness,
alexithymia sum score, SCL-90-R subscales and STAXI
subscales as predictors and pruritus severity as dependent
variable. In CIU patients, the regression analysis was
significant (F,,,. = 10.1; P = 0.003; adj. R?= 0.19) and
revealed state anger as the only significant predictor
(Beta = 0.45; P< 0.01) accounting for 19% of variance in
pruritus severity. Thus, hypothesis 7 could be confirmed.

Figure 1 shows the relationship between state anger
and pruritus severity in CIU patients.

pruritus severity. Thus, hypothesis 8 could be confirmed.

Discussion

Our findings point to difficulties in the identification
and communication of emotions in CIU and psoriasis. As
we controlled for the influence of depression and as
alexithymia scores were not significantly affected by
the duration of the skin disorders, our data indicate
personality based difficulties in emotional regulation
rather than a state-dependent phenomenon. This lack of

emotional awareness may lead to the phenomenon that
emotions are primarily experienced in form of bodily
symptoms.'° From a developmental perspective, one
might argue that alexithymic individuals show an
ontogenetically earlier behavioural-expressive manifestation of affect because the progressive desomatization and
differentiation of early affect manifestations as language
develops and affects are experienced and communicated
consciously by symbolic representations has not taken
place.?* Inner tension and psychophysiological arousal
associated with negative affects cannot be reduced
efficiently by (verbally) expressing and disclosing inner
feelings,**?> and this difficulty can contribute to an
increased emotional distress. In accordance with these
assumptions in both skin disorders, alexithymia is
significantly associated with emotional distress. In CIU, it
is also associated with the experience (state anger, trait
anger) and expression of anger (anger-out).

In line with our hypotheses in both skin disorders, there
was a relationship between pruritus as a major symptom
in both disorders and negative affect. Itch was defined
more than 300 years ago as an unpleasant sensation
that elicits the desire to scratch.*° Taken this still valid
definition,’ it seems to be intuitively appealing to ascribe
pruritus to emotional factors and to see pruritus as a
somatic correlate of anger affect. This might be particularly
appealing in CIU as certain characteristics of bodily
symptoms associated with anger (sudden onset, redness)
show similarities to urticarial reactions. However, to date,
the authors are unaware of any study confirming this
relationship in CIU. Our study shows a strong correlation
between pruritus severity and state anger in CIU, and this
emotional state seemed to be the only significant predictor
for pruritus severity in this skin disorder, whereas in
psoriasis, depression seemed to be the only significant
predictor. In a previous study, Gupta et al.?* found a direct
correlation between depression and pruritus severity in
patients with atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and CIU. In
accordance with our findings, the authors emphasize
that further analysis showed that the relation between
pruritus severity and depression in their sample of 32 CIU
patients was not as strong as in the other diagnostic
groups. However, what could explain the phenomenon
that itch in CIU and psoriasis is associated with different
emotional states? One might argue that the pruritus in
both skin disorders underly different pathophysiological
mechanisms. In CIU, itch can be described as pruritoceptive,
which means it originates primarily in the skin due to
histamine release because of mast cell activation and is
transmitted by C nerve fibers.” Itch in psoriasis is possibly
caused by pruritoceptive and neuropathic mechanisms,
which means that itch originates in disease located at any
point of the afferent pathway.”

Relation between pruritus and anger

Given a higher state anger in CIU compared with
controls, we cannot answer the question whether anger
is a primary feature of CIU or it is secondary to the skin
disorder. Nevertheless, one might ask whether there are
any plausible pathophysiological pathways that might
explain a close relationship between anger and pruritus
perception. We suggest the following pathway. Recent
research showed convincingly that corticotropin-releasing
hormone (CRH) plays an important role in skin mast cell
degranulation.** Typically, in situations that anger or
frighten us, a fight-flight response to stress is triggered. As
part of this response, the reticular activating system
stimulates the hypothalamus to release CRH into the
bloodstream; as another part, CRH is released from dorsal
root ganglia directly in the skin.** CRH release under
stress may be acting together or sequentially with neurotensin to induce skin mast cell activation.” Thus, anger
associated with a CRH-triggered stress response might
lead to an increase in mast cell degranulation. In line with
this pathophysiological mechanism, Laidlaw et al.*> could
show the negative influence of feelings of tension and irritability on wheal size in reaction to histamine. They
observed that the majority of subjects in their study were
able to decrease the size of the wheals using a cognitivehypnotic technique. On the whole mood, variables
proved to be useful in predicting wheal size change with
feelings of irritability and tension being associated with
less change in wheal size.

In support of our findings is the clinical observation that
drugs that are effective in the management of clinically
relevant anger affect or aggression are effective in the
management of pruritus in CIU. Thus, the tricyclic antidepressant doxepin that is frequently used for the treatment of aggressive behaviour in elderly and demented
patients*™ and for the treatment of irritability and restlessness in nicotine withdrawal” is a potent second-line drug
in the treatment of CIU.*¢ It is important to note that the
dosages of doxepin effectively used in CIU are very low
and in the sub-therapeutic range for the treatment of
major depressive disorder.*” The exact mechanism underlying this efficacy is not known. It is generally attributed
to its antihistaminic potency.*’? However, doxepin also
induces a potent alpha adrenergic receptor blockade,*”
which could be of importance with regard to the relationship between anger and pruritus as it may down-regulate
sympathetic tone.

With regard to clinical implications, future studies could
focus on a possible influence of therapeutic strategies
concerning anger management on pruritus perception
in CIU. This might be particularly interesting as previous studies could demonstrate a positive influence of
(expressed) anger on pain intensity,***° and there is considerable similarity between brain regions involved in itch

processing and areas involved in pain processing.?’
Furthermore, future research could investigate, whether
other drugs successful in the treatment of clinically
relevant anger and aggression such as atypical antipsychotics,‘ SSRIs,*! or beta-adrenergic antagonists* in a
lower dosage might also be helpful in the treatment of
pruritus and scratching in CIU.

Obviously, our study has certain limitations. First, we
investigated relatively small samples of CIU and psoriasis
patients, which only facilitates the detection of large
differences.

Second, although there was no significant difference
between the study groups with regard to gender distribution the percentage of men in the CIU group was far lower
compared with the other two study groups (21.9% vs.
45.5% psoriasis and 28.6% control). This difference can
partially be explained by the fact that the prevalence of
psoriasis is equally high in men and women,” whereas
significantly more women are affected by chronic
urticaria.” As men normally score higher on the TAS-20
than women,” alexithymia scores probably would have
been even higher in a CIU sample with a gender distribution
similar to the other groups.

Third, caution should be exercised in drawing conclusion about causality from our cross-sectional study.
