Abstract

Background: Treatment with second-generation antihistamines is recommended in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). Some patients remain unresponsive even after up-dosing up to fourfold. Many third line treatment
options have limited availability and/or give rise to significant side effects. We investigated effectiveness and safety of
antihistamine treatment with dosages up to fourfold and higher.

Methods: This retrospective analysis of patients’ records was performed in adult CSU patients suffering wheals
and/or angioedema (AE). Demographic, clinical, and therapeutic data was extracted from their medical records. We
recorded the type, maximum prescribed dosage, effectiveness, and reported side effects of antihistamine treatment.

Results: Of 200 screened patients, 178 were included. Treatment was commenced with a once daily dose of antihistamines. Persisting symptoms meant that up-dosing up to fourfold occurred in 138 (78%) of patients, yielding suf
ficient response in 41 (23%). Up-dosing antihistamines was necessary in 110 (80%) patient with weals alone or weals
with angioedema and 28 (64%) with AE only (p = 0.039). Of the remaining 97 patients with insufficient response,

59 were treated with dosages higher than fourfold (median dosage 8, range 5-12). This was sufficient in 29 patients
(49%). Side effects were reported in 36 patients (20%), whereof 30 (17%) experienced somnolence. Side effects after
up-dosing higher than fourfold were reported in six out of 59 patients (10%).

Conclusion: Up-dosing antihistamines higher than fourfold dosage seems a feasible therapeutic option with regards
to effectiveness and safety. The need for third line therapies could be decreased by 49%, with a very limited increase

of reported side effects.

Background
Chronic urticaria is either inducible (CINDU) or spontaneous (CSU) or both [1, 2]. Angioedema (AE) can occur
concurrently with urticaria in up to 40% of cases, and
may occur alone in up to 10-20% of cases [3]. Patients
suffering CSU can have wheals only, AE only, or both [1].
The therapeutic approach of chronic urticaria aims at
symptom relief. Licensed doses (1 tablet daily) of modern

second-generation antihistamines (sgAH) are the first
line treatment. An increase in the dose only up to fourfold is recommended as second line treatment [1, 4].
However, every third to fourth patient will remain symptomatic despite up-dosing up to fourfold [5], hence alternative treatments are needed for (partially) unresponsive
patients [1]. Current third-line—in the US guideline
fourth-line—treatment options consist of omalizumab,
cyclosporine A (CsA) or leukotriene receptor antagonist
montelukast [1, 4]. However, each of these options has
limitations: omalizumab is expensive and not reimbursed
worldwide. CsA has a high incidence of adverse effects.

For leukotriene receptor antagonists, the level of evidence for efficacy is low [1].

In our tertiary center, refractory patients were treated
with antihistamines at varying dosages (including dosages higher than fourfold), in order to avoid the use of
CsA as omalizumab had not yet been approved for treatment of CSU. Despite a lack of controlled studies, experts
have reported benefit of dosing antihistamines higher
than fourfold in CSU patients [6]. The objective of this
study was to investigate the frequency of ineffectiveness of treatment with antihistamines up to fourfold the
standard dose in patients with CSU, and to determine the
effectiveness and safety of antihistamine treatment above
fourfold the standard dose,.

Methods

Study design and subjects

A retrospective analysis of patients’ records was performed in patients visiting our tertiary dermatology and
allergology clinic for the evaluation of chronic urticaria
and/or angioedema in 2012 (before registration of omalizumab), and for each patient all available data were collected up to 2014. Adult patients suffering CSU (wheals
and/or AE for at least 6 weeks) were selected. All patients
with other diagnoses including acute urticaria (duration of symptoms less than 6 weeks), CINDU including
symptomatic dermographism, urticaria or angioedema
caused by allergy or of other known causes, urticaria pigmentosa and urticaria vasculitis were excluded. Medical
records were screened to verify inclusion and exclusion
criteria. To be recognized as a representative sample, 159
patients were needed (based on a margin of error of 5%,
a confidence interval of 95% and an eligible population
of 268 patients) [7]. To have a representation of both AE
patients and patients with wheals, all 100 available AE
atients and 100 additional patients with wheals were

Page 2 of 8

screened for inclusion in the study. Patients with wheals
were randomly selected based on their unique patient
identification number in the electronic medical record
system; dossiers of the patients with the lowest numbers were screened until 100 patients with wheals were
included.

Data were collected as described below, and used in
strictly anonymous form, according to the code of conduct for medical research approved by the hospital’s
Medical Ethical Committee. Written informed consent
for the publication of this report was not required from
the patients, as approved by the Ethics Committee, protocol number 13-459.

Treatment regimen

The local treatment protocol, as shown in Fig. 1, commenced with the approved dosage of antihistamine, and
in case of persisting symptoms up-dosing occurred up to
fourfold. Higher than fourfold dosages were only used in
patients who remained symptomatic at fourfold antihistamine dosages. Treatment adjustments were performed
individually by all prescribing physicians of the department. Patients often were already on antihistamine treatment prior to their first visit at the clinic. In this case,
they did not have to start at the licensed dosage, but
could further follow the local protocol. All treatment was
open. At the start of the study, standard disease-specific
questionnaires were not yet available and therefore not
used.

Data collection

After inclusion, data was collected from electronic
patient records. Data regarding demographic and therapeutic characteristics until 2014 was extracted manually
from the electronic medical records from each patient’s
first visit to the clinic. Outcome variables were the type

of antihistamines patients were treated with, the maximal
prescribed dosage, treatment results, and reported side
effects.

For each patient antihistamine use was recorded as
daily treatment as well as rescue medication., The type,
maximal prescribed dosage, treatment results including
clinical symptoms of wheals, angioedema, and itch, and
reported side effects were also recorded. Antihistamines
were prescribed prior to or during consultations at this
tertiary hospital. In the Netherlands, all types and dosages of antihistamines are reimbursed, hence prescribing
is not affected by insurance. The doctor’s reported effect
from each treatment option was allocated by the investigators into one of two categories: sufficient or insufficient. Disagreements were discussed and resolved. When
the dose of antihistamines was raised and further information was missing, it was interpreted that lower doses
did not reach sufficient response. The reported effect
from dosages higher than fourfold was further subdivided into four different categories: (1) no effect (2) insufficient effect and patient not satisfied, (3) partial disease
control, and patient satisfied, or (4) completely free of
symptoms. If information was unclear category allocation was performed by two investigators. Up-dosing
higher than fourfold was preferably performed by combining more than one type of antihistamine. In these
cases the effect of one specific antihistamine was unclear
and was not included for analysis. In case of side effects,
the type of side effect as reported in the medical record,
as well as the corresponding eliciting dosage of antihistamines, were recorded. Additional blood tests were not
performed routinely.

Analyses

Descriptive statistics were performed using IBM SPSS
Statistics version 21. To explore differences in the proportion of patients with sufficient or insufficient effect
from antihistamines in the three subgroups of patients
(wheals only, AE only, and both wheals and AE), patients
with unknown effect of treatment were excluded, and
the Pearson Chi Square (Chi square) test was used. The
Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact (Fischer’s exact) test was
used in cases of low numbers.

Results

Population

Of the 200 screened patients, 178 patients (121 [68%]
female; median age 48.2 years [range 20—87]) were diagnosed with CSU and were included in the study, including 10 patients who suffered both CSU and CINDU. Five
of 200 were excluded due to angioedema with known
causes (1 with HAE, 1 with specific allergy, and 3 with
ACEi-AE) and 17 were excluded since they had only

Page 3 of 8

inducible symptoms (CINDU). Of the included 178, 43
patients (24%) had wheals only, 44 (25%) had AE only,
and the remaining 91 (51%) suffered both symptoms.
The median disease duration before the first consultation at our University referral center was 1 year (range
0-41.5 years). Ninety-four patients (53%) reported that
they had previously visited another dermatologist or
allergologist for evaluation of wheals and/or AE. All visits
per patient were reviewed, and this comprised a median
number of visits of 2 (range 1-57) and an additional
median number of 2 consultations per telephone (range
0-24).

Maximum doses and effectiveness of antihistamines

All 178 included patients were initially treated with the
licensed, once daily, dosage of antihistamines (Fig. 2).
Of them, 27 patients (15%) used antihistamines only on
demand. In 138 patients (78%) the licensed dose was ineffective and in all these refractory patients the dose was
raised up to fourfold. This remained ineffective in 97
(70%). Subsequently, 59 of these 97 patients were treated
with higher doses of antihistamines by combining two
types of second generation antihistamines with a maximum of eightfold the licensed dose. The median maximal
combined dose of antihistamines in these 59 was eightfold (range 5-8), however in 8 individuals the dose was
raised further (range 9-12). Ten of 59 patients (17%)
subsequently became completely free of symptoms, and
nineteen patients (32%) had sufficient results. Thus, in
49% of patients a higher than fourfold dose reduced or
completely eliminated symptoms. The remaining 38 of
the 97 refractory patients received no further treatment
(n = 28), or further treatment was unknown (n = 8), or
they received other types of therapy including ultraviolet (UV) treatment (n = 2), for which effectiveness results
were not included in the current study (Fig. 2).

Need for up-dosing in wheals versus AE without wheals
Up-dosing up to fourfold was necessary more frequently
in patients with wheals (wheals only: 35 of 43 patients;
81%, wheals and AE: 75 of 91 patients; 82%) than in AE
without wheals (28 of 44 patients; 64%; p = 0.039). However, when looking specifically at those with only one of
the two symptoms, there was no statistically significant
difference between wheals only and AE only (p = 0.053,
Table 1a).

A trend was observed that up-dosing higher than
fourfold was also necessary more often in patients with
wheals (17; 40%) compared to AE only (7; 16%; p = 0.056,
Table 1a).

Response to antihistamine dosages higher than fourfold dichotomized as sufficient (29 patients [58%]) versus
insufficient (21 patients [42%]) did not differ between the

three diagnosis groups (p = 0.530, Table 1b), or between
patients with wheals only or AE only (p = 0.620).

Types of antihistamines

The 178 patients received a total of 354 antihistamine
prescriptions. As shown in Table 2, the most frequently
prescribed antihistamines were levocetirizine (71% of
patients), desloratadine (56%) and fexofenadine (23%). A
total of 35 patients (20%) were treated with clemastine,
and 26 patients (15%) were treated with hydroxyzine.
Since 12 patients were treated with both hydroxyzine and
clemastine at any time during their disease, a total of 49
patients (28%) received first-generation antihistamines
(fgAH). All patients who were treated with fgAH were
refractory to licensed doses: 13 (27%) received fgAH as
part of up-dosing up to fourfold, and the remaining 36

Page 4 of 8

(73%) received fgAH in addition to sgAH to reach total
dosages of antihistamines higher than fourfold. Clemastine was up-dosed in 11 patients up to 3 mg per 24h
period, and hydroxyzine in nine patients up to 75 mg per
24h.

Safety of antihistamines

Of the 178 patients 36 (20%) reported side effects upon
treatment with antihistamines independent of the dosage. Fifteen of 36 patients reported side effects for
two (n = 14) or three (n = 1) different antihistamines
(Table 3). Somnolence (Fig. 3a) was reported in 30 of
36 patients (83%), including 5 patients (10%) treated
with fgAH and 28 (16%) with sgAH. Six out of 36 (17%)
reported side effects only during treatment with dosages
higher than fourfold (Fig. 3b). They consisted of somnolence in five patients and were unclear in 1. Vomiting or
diarrhea were not reported by any of the patients.

Discussion

In CSU patients refractory to up to fourfold doses of
antihistamines, higher than fourfold dosages reduced or
completely eliminated symptoms in an additional 49%.
Side effects were reported in 20% of patients and consisted mainly of somnolence. After up-dosing higher than
fourfold only 6 out of 59 patients (10%) reported side
effects.

In more than half of the total population response
remained insufficient despite antihistamine treatment
up to fourfold, consistent with previous studies [8-10].
Up-dosing higher than fourfold, with a median dose of
eight tablets daily, was effective in half of patients including those with wheals only, with AE only, and with both
symptoms. This is promising, since antihistamines have
low costs as opposed to CsA or omalizumab, and they are
available worldwide [1]. There is a lack of rationale for the
dosage of fourfold being the maximum. In contrast, in
both CSU and in cold urticaria, treatment with four tablets per day was shown to be more effective than three
tablets per day, which in turn was more beneficial than
two tablets or one tablet per day, indicating that higher
doses could be more effective [9, 11]. Moreover, hydroxyzine is prescribed up to 200 mg/day, and because 30 mg
of hydroxyzine equals about 10 mg cetirizine [11]. Twohundred mg equals a dose of 60 mg cetirizine/day, considerably higher than fourfold. Since such high dosages
of hydroxyzine are used in daily practice, it was likely
that higher dosages of other antihistamines could also be
effective. Additionally, hydroxyzine is a first generation
antihistamine with considerably more side-effects than
cetirizine. We conclude that many patients indeed had
a favorable response to higher doses of antihistamines
when doses up to fourfold were insufficient.

in this analysis

The effect of antihistamines, but only up to fourfold,
has been studied previously, but very few head-to-head
studies have been performed [9, 12]. Some studies have
examined antihistamines up to fourfold [9, 13], or four
tablets daily [8]. The latter may be somewhat confusing,
for instance for fexofenadine where both 120 and 180 mg
tablets are available. There are also studies available where
only twofold dosages were the maximum [10]. Some studies showed preponderance of efficacy of higher dosages in
the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria [8—10, 14],
and cold and cholinergic urticaria [15-18]. In contrast, in

some other studies comparable efficacy of standard and
higher dosages was found [19-22].

The most frequently used antihistamine were sgAH.
The use of fgAH is discouraged in the European guideline [1] since serious side-effects of these old sedating
antihistamines have been reported, including lethal overdoses. Additionally, in the elderly they increase the risk
of impaired cognition, inattention, disorganized speech,
altered consciousness, and falls [1]. Yet, a substantial
number of patients was treated with fgAH at some time
during their disease: clemastine was prescribed to 20%

Data are presented as numbers and percentages of patients treated with this antihistamine. Patients may have reported side effects upon treatment with more than
one antihistamine, therefore the numbers do not match the total number of patients reporting at least one side effect. “Other” side effects occurred in one patient
each, unless otherwise specified. Percentages are rounded and may therefore not match within one row. Please note that a low frequency of side effects may be due
to a low frequency of use for the specific antihistamine, and to a lack of updating in the study population since only patient-reported side effects were shown

Fig. 3 Frequency of side effects, by a type of side effect, and
b maximum dose. The following dosages were considered as
standard dose: levocetirizine 5 mg, desloratadine 5 mg, fexofenadine
180 mg, clemastine 1 mg, hydroxyzine 25 mg, cetirizine 10 mg, loratadine 10 mg, acrivastine 8 mg three times daily

and hydroxyzine to 15%. It was previously suggested that
some physicians were not fully aware of the content of
the most recent guidelines and therefore did not follow

them [23]. However, the successful use of fgAH after failure of treatment with sgAH has been described [24]. Furthermore, the US guideline does support the use of fgAH
in patients who do not achieve control of their condition
with higher-dose second-generation antihistamines [4].
Our results support that the addition of not only ssAH
but also of fgAH can lead to sufficient disease control
when either licensed doses of sgAH, or dosages up to
fourfold had failed.

Somnolence was reported by a minority of patients.
It is well known that somnolence is one of the most
reported unwanted effects of antihistamines. It occurs
even when using sgAH [9] in up to 23% of patients [8],
and it does not significantly increase when comparing
with baseline somnolence [9], or when antihistamine
doses are increased [8]. This was confirmed in our study
for even higher dosages. Patients treated with fgAH did
not report sedation more often than those treated with
only sgAH. A possible explanation for this is that fgAH
were mostly used in low dosages in addition to high dosages of sgAH, whereas often times relatively high doses
of fgAH are used [24-26]. Very few of the side effects
(10%) were reported only when antihistamine dosages
were raised higher than fourfold. For desloratadine it
was previously shown that dosages up to ninefold did not
lead to clinically relevant adverse effects [27]. The low
frequency of somnolence in the current study is likely to
be an underestimation of unwanted effects due to missing information or recall bias, and since patients were
not all actively asked about side effects, including but not
limited to somnolence. It could also be caused by tolerance to somnolence which can develop within 4 days
of subsequent use of H1 antihistamines [24, 28]. It was
hypothesized that this is caused by adapted neuropharmacological effects [28]. On the other hand, it remains
difficult to distinguish somnolence caused by treatment

 
van den Elzen et al. Clin Trans! Allergy (2017) 7:4

from somnolence caused by sleep disturbances due to
the disease [8, 9]. Pruritus is most bothersome during
the evening and at night when it makes falling asleep difficult and wakes patients later in the night. This causes
chronic fatigue with a direct impact on QoL and physical
and emotional well-being [5]. Still, although the influence
of prolonged treatment on somnolence may be limited,
and improvement of urticarial symptoms reduces somnolence [9], urticaria patients report sleep difficulties
almost twice as often as control subjects [29], and our
results support that somnolence occurred in a minority
of urticaria patients [8].

A limitation of this study is the retrospective design.
Therefore, precise documentation of results of treatment
was missing in some patients. Also, there was a lack of
objective measurements of effectiveness. With regard
to side effects, we presented these as collected from the
medical records. Somnolence was the most frequently
named side effect. Liver and kidney function tests were
not performed routinely. However, the extent of missing information was rather limited and different results
are therefore not expected. Furthermore, the EAACI/
GA2LEN/EDF/WAO urticaria guideline does not recommend to combine antihistamines [1], since the mechanism of action of sgAH is similar and mixing different
antihistamines would therefore theoretically not have
additional benefits [12]. In the current study we combined different antihistamines. This was performed in
case dosages higher than fourfold were given, to limit
side-effects related to a specific antihistamine. Lastly,
CSU is a self-limiting disease. In the current study spontaneous remission may have occurred and this would
then be misinterpreted as effectiveness of treatment.

In conclusion, we show that by up-dosing antihistamines higher than fourfold, half of patients reached sufficient treatment response while causing a limited increase
in side effects. The need for other third line therapies
could be decreased considerably. These findings need
to be confirmed in a prospective controlled study. The
results are of special interest in case of side effects or
contraindications to currently proposed third line treatments, or when they are locally not (yet) available.
