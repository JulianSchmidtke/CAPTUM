The coincidence of Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) and chronic
idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is a commonly observed phenomenon in western New York. Previous literature suggested that
there may be a direct relationship between them. We undertook
these studies to determine whether humoral or cell-mediated
mechanisms might link HT and CIU.

Skin biopsies from patients with CIU, with or without HT,
were indistinguishable by light microscopy. No immune complex deposition was observed, although only the skin from
patients with CIU and HT contained perivascular fibrin deposits. Similarly, immunohistochemical studies evaluating cellular
expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, and CD68 failed to
differentiate between CIU with or without HT. Analysis of VB
restriction in thyroid tissue of patients with HT and the skin of
patients with CIU and HT by in situ polymerase chain reaction
failed to reveal any oligoclonal T-lymphocyte subpopulations.
In contrast, only patients with CIU and HT had anti-FceRI
antibodies in their sera that could induce degranulation of
normal basophils. Some sera from patients with CIU and HT
caused degranulation of normal basophils in the absence of
anti-FceRI. The factor causing basophil degranulation in these
sera was not determined. Patients with CIU and HT failed to
improve clinically with thyroid replacement therapy. All CIU
patients were equally well managed with symptomatic therapies.

In conclusion, HT likely represents a marker of other
autoimmunity, rather than being a direct causative agent in
CIU. Management of CIU, with or without HT and with or

studies will have to examine whether cell-mediated responses
participate in CIU, especially in association with HT.

INTRODUCTION

The pathogenesis of chronic urticaria remains poorly
understood. Despite extensive clinical investigations, no
cause is identified in the majority of patients (1). Treatment is largely symptomatic. However, in the past
decade, new concepts have emerged regarding its pathogenesis, at least in a subgroup of patients.

Since most patients with chronic urticaria are not
atopic, Mathews (2) proposed that autoimmunity may be
a contributing factor. An increasing body of literature has
accumulated to support this hypothesis (3-5). This includes several observations: (a) an allergic etiology
cannot be found in most patients (1); (b) injecting
autologous serum under the skin of patients with urticaria leads to localized urticaria (6, 7); (c) CD4*
lymphocytes are found in the infiltrate in the dermis of
chronic urticaria patients, similar to other organ-specific
autoimmune diseases (8, 9); and (d) autoantibodies
reacting with IgE and the high-affinity receptor for
IgE—FceRI—have been detected in the sera of patients
with chronic urticaria (10-12). Recently, increased
CD40L expression on activated T cells and increased
bel-2 expression in activated B and T lymphocytes were
found in severe chronic urticaria patients (13). Similar
genetic dysregulation has been observed in patients with
autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (14, 15).

The association between chronic idiopathic urticaria
(CIU) and thyroid autoimmunity (TA), was first described by Leznoff et a/ (16) in 1983. They reported an
increased incidence of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT)

among patients with chronic urticaria. In a larger study,
Leznoff and Sussman (17) found 14.4% incidence of
thyroid autoimmunity among 624 patients with chronic
urticaria. Several other investigators have reported a
similar association (18-20). The basis for such an
association, if any, is not well understood. Some investigators used thyroid hormones in the therapy of CIU
with variable results (21, 22).

We undertook this study because of the large number
of patients with chronic urticaria and/or HT that were
referred to our service. We sought to determine whether
there were differences in the clinical features of patients
with chronic urticaria, whether or not they had HT. We
sought to examine several hypotheses for how these two
entities might be related: (a) immune complexes produced in the course of HT thyroiditis are trapped in the
skin and cause urticaria; (b) inflammatory cells activated
in the thyroid are directed toward a cross-reactive antigen existing in the skin; (c) there is no direct relationship
between the inflammation in the thyroid and the skin, but
autoimmunity directed toward FceRI coexists with autoimmunity directed toward the thyroid gland in susceptible patients; and (d) there is no relationship between
chronic urticaria and HT, but they are both common
disorders that are bound to coexist in a small percentage
of people.

METHODS

Patient Population and Control

Medical charts of 610 patients who were referred to
local allergists for the evaluation and management o
chronic urticaria were reviewed. Chronic urticaria was
defined as the daily or almost daily recurrent itchy skin
eruption for over 6 weeks. Sixty of these patients also
met the criteria for HT, which was defined as a titer 0
anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TG) >2 [U/ml and/ or
anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies at a titer >2
IU/ml. Fourteen of the patients with HT were receiving
thyroid replacement for treatment of hypothyroidism. O
the patients with both CIU and HT, 27 patients agreed to
participate in the studies (group 1). Measurement o
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was done in all
patients. Five patients with CIU and negative thyroid
antibodies were enrolled as group 2. Patients were
followed for an average of 12 months. Patients were
defined as responders to therapy if their urticaria either
disappeared or decreased in the frequency of occurrence
and skin distribution by greater than 50%. Nine healthy
laboratory personnel with no history of chronic urticaria

served as controls (group 3). Thyroid tissues from eight
other female patients with HT that had been removed
because of a fear of malignancy were obtained from the
Department of Pathology at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI).

Patients with urticarial vasculitis, physical urticaria,
dermatographism, and systemic lupus erythematosis
(SLE) were excluded. None of the study patients were
taking corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs
at the time of enrollment.

Informed consents were obtained from all the patients.
The institutional review board of Kaleida Health and the
SUNY at Buffalo School of Medicine and Biomedical
Sciences approved the study protocol.

Methods

Sera were obtained from all patients and stored at
—80° C. Two 3-mm skin biopsies were taken from each
patient. One was fixed in 10% formalin and then embedded in paraffin. The other was used for immunofluorescence studies. Four-micron sections were cut from each
biopsy and either stained with hematoxylin and eosin for
histopathological examination, or used for immunohistochemical or in situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
studies.

Thyroid tissues obtained from RPCI were investigated
for the same microscopic features, immunohistochemical
studies, and in situ PCR evaluations as the skin biopsies.
None of the chronic urticaria patients in this study had a
medical indication for a thyroid biopsy or thyroidectomy,
so there was no opportunity to simultaneously evaluate
the skin and thyroid of the same patient.

Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemical staining was performed using
the Ventana basic diaminobenzidine (DAB) detection
system, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, sections were deparaffinized and digested with
pepsin. The inhibitor solution was added to remove the
endogenous peroxidase activity for 4 min at 37°C.
Incubation with the primary antibody was performed for
30 min at room temperature. Murine monoclonal antihuman CD20 antibody (B lymphocyte), murine monoclonal anti-human CD68 antibody (macrophage), rabbit
polyclonal anti-human CD3 antibody (T lymphocyte),
murine monoclonal anti-human CD4 (“helper” T lymphocyte), and anti-human CD8 (“killer” T lymphocyte)
antibodies (Dako, Cambridge, England) were used. The
slides were then incubated with biotin-conjugated goat
anti-murine antibodies or goat—anti-rabbit antibodies, for

8 min at 37°C. Next, the slides were incubated for 8 min
with avidin horseradish peroxidase. The specific antibody, secondary antibody, and avidin enzyme complex
were then visualized using DAB. Copper enhancement
was performed and the slides counterstained with hematoxylin. Positive immunostaining resulted in brown labeling of positive cells. All skin and thyroid tissues were
evaluated for expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, and
CD68.

Immunofluorescence

Tissues were sectioned and air dried thoroughly. The
fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-human IgG, IgA, IgM,
C3, fibrin (Dake, Cambriidge, England) were diluted
1:1000 with PBS and centrifuged to remove precipitated
debris. The slides were washed gently in PBS for 15 min,
then placed in a moist chamber. Diluted antibody conjugates were placed on the tissue and incubated at room
temperature for 30 min. Slides were then washed in PBS
for 15 min. Johnson’s media was placed on each cover
slip and the slides visualized by fluorescence micros
copy.

In Situ PCR

Three sections from each tissue sample, 4 wm in
thickness, were placed on glass microscopic slide. They
were deparaffinized with xylene and alcohol, and digested with pepsin (2 mg/ml) (Roche, IN). The optimal
digestion conditions were determined using the hot start
maneuver as described by Nuovo (23). Tissue digestion
was terminated by placing the slide in Tris solution (PH
7.5) and then ethanol. The slides were then left to air dry.
The tissue samples and negative controls were then
incubated overnight with RNAase-free, DNAase I solution (Roche, IN) in a humidity chamber at 37°C. Positive
control sections received no DNAase I. The slides were
then placed in Tris solution, followed by ethanol.

In situ PCR solution was prepared according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Perkin-Elmer) using DNA
polymerase, RNAase inhibitor, gene amplification
buffer, digoxigenin-labeled dNTP, and 2% BSA and
specific primers for various T-cell receptor families.
Specific V6 primers and Cf primers for the T-cell
receptor families V beta 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 20 were synthesized
according to previously published studies (24). Using the
assembly tool, in situ PCR solution was placed on the
tissue samples using Amplicover disks (Perkin Elmer).
In situ PCR was completed by placing the slides in a
gene-amp thermocycler that used 20 cycles of 60° F for
1 min and 94°F for 30 sec. Detection of the amplified

signal was done using anti-digoxigenin—AP antibodies
(Roche, Germany) and NBT/BCIP (Roche), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Tissue signal was considered acceptable if good cell morphology was maintained, the positive control signal was present in >50%
of cells, and the negative control did not show any
detectable signal. The entire tissue section was then
screened for the presence of a signal with the designated
primers.

Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate—Polyacrylamide Gel
Electrophoresis Immunoblotting

Purified recombinant human high affinity IgE receptor,
alpha chain-HSA fusion protein(130 kDa), produced in
CHO cells was obtained from Novartis. This protein was
electrophoresed at 750 ng/lane in 10-12% Tris—glycine
gels (Invitrogen, Netherlands) and then blotted overnight
onto nitrocellulose membranes, as previously described
(25). The membranes then were blocked with 5% powdered milk in PBS for 1 hr at 20° C. Membranes then
were incubated with patients’ sera at various dilutions
and with positive and negative sera at a dilution of 1:200
for 30 min at 20° C. (The negative and positive control
sera were kindly provided by Allen Kaplan, University
of South Carolina.) After washing three times with TBS
for 15 min each at 20° C, membranes were incubated
with anti-human IgG (H+L)-AP conjugate (Promega,
Madison, WI) at a dilution of 1:7500 for | hr at 20° C.
After washing three times with TBS, antibody binding
was visualized by incubating the membrane with NBT/
BCIP (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Basophil Histamine Release Assay

The basophil histamine release assay was performed
according to previously published protocols (26). In
short, basophil-enriched leukocytes were obtained from
normal donors using 6% dextran sedimentation. The
cells were washed and resuspended in assay buffer
containing 10 mM HEPES, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM
KCL, 0.4 M NaH,PO,, 0.03% human albumin, 5 mM
glucose, 2 mM calcium, and | mM magnesium, with pH
7.4. Leukocyte suspensions were incubated in a 37° C
water bath for 5 min and then aliquoted into polypropylene tubes at a final reaction volume of 200 pl per
tube. Challenge stimuli were sera from individual patients with urticaria, normal subjects, and known positive
and negative control sera. Calcium ionophore A23187
was used as a positive control to demonstrate histamine
release. Basophils were incubated with the challenge

RESULTS

Patient Characteristics

The characteristics of the patients used in this study
are shown in Table I. Thirty-two patients who met the
criteria for CIU were enrolled. Twenty-nine were females. Age ranged from 12 to 60 years with a mean of 37
years in group 1, 14 to 39 years with a mean of 27 in
group and 18 to 48 years with a mean of 38 years in
group 3. Only five patients from group | were atopic by

history and skin testing, none in group 2, and one normal
control. The duration of urticaria ranged from 1 to 20
years. Five patients had elevated IgE levels. One patient
in group 1 was diagnosed with Graves’ disease and
treated with radioactive iodine ablation before being
treated with thyroid hormone for secondary hypothyroidism. There with no change in the course of her urticaria.
Overall, 17 patients received thyroid hormone replacement, 14 for overt hypothyroidism and 3 as a trial in the
therapy of their HT-related urticaria (22). In almost all
the patients, the diagnosis of HT preceded the appearance of urticarial lesions. Three patients had other
diseases (diabetes mellitus in one, multiple sclerosis in
one, congestive heart failure in one). All of group 1 and

group 2 patients were receiving some type of antihistamine in their therapy.

Clinical Observations

Most patients continued to have relapses of urticaria
with no change in the course of their disease after
treatment with thyroid hormone. Three patients in group
1 reported reduction in the number of their urticarial
lesions upon the institution of thyroid hormone therapy.
All these patients had evidence of hypothyroidism. None
of the three euthyroid patients, who were given a trial of
thyroid hormone therapy, demonstrated any improvement in their disease. Thyroid hormone withdrawal was
instituted in four patients, with no change in their
urticaria. There was no significant difference between
patients in groups | and 2 with regards to the number of
their lesions or the frequency of their relapses. There was
no significant difference in the severity of urticaria or the
response to therapy between patients with or without
anti-FceRI antibodies.

Histopathologic Features

SKIN. The classic histopathologic appearance of urticaria was observed in the skin of all the patients in
groups | and 2. This includes dermal edema, dilated
blood vessels, and a perivascular infiltrate, which consisted mainly of lymphocytes, eosinophils, macrophages,
and mast cells. None of these findings were identified in
the normal control. Interestingly, the skin of patients
with urticaria that did not have recognizable skin lesions
at the time of biopsy also showed the same histopathologic findings as the skin of patients with overt urticaria.
No vasculitis was seen in any of the skin biopsies. There
was no difference in the histopathologic appearance of
the skin of patients in groups | and 2 (Fig. 1). There was
no difference in the histopathologic appearance of the
skin of patients with or without anti-FceRI antibodies
(data not shown).

THYROID. Thyroid tissue from patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis revealed a prominent cellular infiltrate
that consisted mainly of lymphocytes. Lymphoid follicles were present in almost all of the tissues, associated
with varying degrees of follicular destruction and oxyphilic epithelial metaplasia. Fibrosis was observed in
four of eight glands studied (Fig. 2).

skin biopsy is shown in Fig. 3, demonstrating the
anti-CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, and CD68 staining.

Almost all patients biopsied had a perivascular infiltrate that consisted of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes.
There was a predominance of CD4+ over CD8+ lymphocytes in all the skin biopsies. Less frequently, macrophages, eosinophils, and mast cells also were seen.
None of the skin biopsies contained B lymphocytes,
except for that of one patient who had particularly severe
and chronic urticaria (CE). There was no significant
difference in the nature of the cutaneous cellular infiltrate
between patients in groups | or 2, or between patients
who did or did not produce anti-FceRI antibodies.

interest, CD4 staining was found in the thyroidal epithelial cells. Cells that were both CD3+ and CD4+ cells
were found primarily in the perifollicular regions.

There was subtle fibrin deposition in the dermal blood
vessels of patients from group 1, but not groups 2 or 3.

No IgG, IgM, IgA, or C3 deposits were detected in any
of the specimens examined.

In Situ PCR

The findings are summarized in Table IV. Representative skin and thyroid tissue in situ PCR studies for VB6
and V8 are shown in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively.

Among the 22 patients tested, analysis of the TCR VB
restriction of the lymphocytic infiltrate of the skin
biopsies demonstrated TCR V2 expression in three
patients, one showed TCR V8 expression, and two
patients showed TCR V6 expression. All patients were
from group |, except the patient with VB8 expression
who belonged to group 2. The rest of the skin biopsies
showed no significant expression of the VB families
analyzed. In no case did a majority of infiltrating cells
express a TCR utilizing a single VB family.

In contrast to the skin, three of the thyroid tissue
showed V8 expression but no expression of the other
five VB families that were analyzed. In no case did a
majority of infiltrating cells express a TCR utilizing a
single VB family.

SDS-PAGE Immunoblotting

The findings are summarized in Table V. A representative Western blot assay is shown in Fig. 7.

Anti-FceRI antibodies were detected at a titer of 1:200
or greater in the sera of eight patients with CIU (25%).
Two normal control sera had similar antibodies at similar
dilutions. Twenty sera from patients with SLE or various
systemic vasculitides were also tested. Of those, only one
patient with SLE and no history of urticaria had antiFceRI antibodies.

Basophil Histamine Release Assay

The findings are summarized in Table VI. Sera of 15
out of 32 patients with CIU (47%) released 10% or
greater histamine from the basophils of a nonatopic
donor. All of those patients except three had HT.
Histamine release ranged from 12 to 64%. Calcium
ionophore released 35% histamine. Five of eight sera
(62%) from patients with CIU and demonstrated to have
anti-FceRI antibodies by the Western blot assay caused
significant histamine release in this assay. Four of these
positive sera were from patients with HT. Of note, the
sera from the two normal controls and the one SLE
patient, which contained anti-FceRI antibodies (Table
V), did not cause significant histamine release. In addition, basophil histamine release was induced by the sera
of some patients with CIU that did not have anti-FceRI
antibodies; 80% of these sera were from patients with HT.

DISCUSSION

We have demonstrated in this study that the histopathologic and immunohistochemical analyses of urticaria from patients with or without HT are largely
indistinguishable. Subtle differences were noted in the
immunofluorescent studies. While none of the biopsies
demonstrated immune complex deposition, only the skin
biopsies from HT patients showed fibrin deposition. No
oligoclonal populations of lymphocytes could be demonstrated in the skin of urticaria patients with or without
HT or in the thyroid glands of patients with HT. Sera
from patients with CIU and HT were more likely to
induce histamine release from the basophils of normal
donors than sera from patients with CIU alone. In only
some cases did the ability to induce basophil histamine
release correlate with the presence of antibodies to
FceRI. Antibodies to FceRI in the sera of normal donors
and SLE patients without urticaria did not induce basophil histamine release.

The histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and in
situ PCR studies argue against a direct relationship
between HT and chronic urticaria. There is no evidence
for immune complexes in the skin. There is no evidence
that cellular immunity initiated in the thyroid leads to
pathological changes in the skin, although these studies
are unable to rule out the possibility that a small
population of cells does function in this way. Investigators examining thyroid tissues in HT, including the work
in these studies, have had difficulty in demonstrating
restriction in the lymphocyte subpopulations residing in
the thyroid gland and have argued that multiple different
epitopes are recognized simultaneously in HT (27-29).
342

We did find small aggregates of VB8- or VB6-restricted
T lymphocytes in the skin of some patients with CIU and
HT and cannot rule out the possibility that these cells
came from the thyroid gland. Aggregates of VB8restricted T lymphocytes were found in several of the
thyroid glands from patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis.
In the absence of local B lymphocytes or antibodies,
these T lymphocytes would have to induce mast cell
degranulation by releasing chemokines or tachykinins to
cause urticaria (30-32).

Furthermore, the clinical data argue against a direct
relationship between HT and CIU. In our study, the
incidence of TA in patients with CIU was 10%. This is
similar to the incidence of TA in other studies evaluating
patients with CIU (17, 19) and in the normal population.
Anti-thyroid antibodies have been estimated to be
present in 9—18% of the normal adult female population
(33-35). The use of thyroid hormone did not appear to
influence the course of the urticaria in any of the patients
with HT, whether or not they had hypothyroidism. This
is in contrast to one study, in which thyroid hormone
replacement caused resolution of chronic urticaria in
euthyroid patients (22). Other investigators have noted
similar clinical responses to thyroid replacement as in
this study (17).

“The designated VB families were evaluated in the skin and thyroid

tissues of the listed patients. A + sign designates a VB family for
which several aggregates of positive lymphocytes were identified (see
Fig. 5 and 6).

The next issue regarding the relationship between CIU
and HT is whether patients with CIU and HT have a
more generalized autoimmune phenotype that includes
antibodies to FceRI. Our data suggest that patients with
CIU and HT are more likely than CIU patients, normal
donors, or patients with other autoimmune diseases to
have anti-FceRI antibodies that induce histamine release
from normal donors. However, not all patients with HT
had these antibodies, some patients with CIU without HT
had these antibodies, and sera of some HT patients

histamine release. We found anti-FceRI antibodies in
25% of CIU patients, of whom 80% had HT; 57% of the
anti-FceRI antibodies from CIU and HT patients induced
basophil histamine release. One study reported an incidence of 37% for CIU patients with anti-FceRI antibodies (36) and another 50% (37). The former studied noted
anti-FceRI antibodies only in CIU patients, not in normal
controls or patients with atopic dermatitis. The latter
study noted that only 9% of the CIU sera but also 7% of
normal sera induced histamine release from normal

343

basophils. A recent study identified anti-FceRI antibodies that could induce basophil histamine release among
patients with CIU and atopy, and normal controls. Many
of these antibodies were found to recognize tetanus
toxoid (38). Finally, a recent evaluation of patients with
multiple etiologies for acute and chronic urticaria identified antibodies to FceRI in the sera of patients with
chronic urticaria from a wide variety of different causes,
including drug allergy, food allergy, Helicobacter pylori
infection, and various autoimmune diseases (39). Thus,
antibodies to FceRI likely participate in chronic urticaria

EVALUATION OF CHRONIC URTICARIA

In conclusion, this study suggests that CIU and HT are
not directly linked, but HT may be a marker for a
subgroup of patients who also have autoimmune responses that may contribute to the presence of urticaria.
These autoimmune responses include humoral mechanisms, namely anti-FceRI antibodies, which were documented in this and other studies. Cell-mediated autoimmune responses resulting in release of chemokines,
tachykinins, and/or other histamine-releasing factors,
need to be evaluated in future studies. The clinical course
of CIU does not appear to be significantly different
whether or not it involves HT and/or anti-FceRI antibodies. Treatment for these various conditions should be
identical.
