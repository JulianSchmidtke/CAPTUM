Results: One hundred seventeen samples from 88 CSU patients and 28 samples from
healthy controls were analysed. Median cHK level in CSU was 9.1% (range: 1.4%21.5%), significantly increased compared to healthy controls (median 6.0% range:
0%-19.9%; P = .0005) and comparable to HAE (n = 46, median 10.3%, range 0%44.3%, P > 9999). CHK levels normalized in patients during disease remission (median

acute angioedema attacks or response to antihistamines. Surprisingly, cHK levels
were inversely correlated to serum tryptase (r = -0.65 P = .0137). C1-INH complexes
and suPAR levels were not elevated in patients compared to healthy controls. PAPcomplex levels in patients were elevated compared to healthy controls but there was
no correlation between PAP-complex and cHK levels.

Conclusions: cHK levels are elevated in symptomatic CSU patients compared to
healthy controls, indicating increased bradykinin production. Increased cHK levels

are not limited to patients with angioedema.

1 | INTRODUCTION

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is hallmarked by recurrent
itchy weals and/or angioedema. The pathophysiology of CSU is
not fully understood. Mast cell and histamine involvement are
strongly implicated, and patients demonstrate clinical response to
the anti-lgE monoclonal antibody omalizumab and antihistamine
therapy.”

Angioedema is a common symptom of CSU. When patients
experience angioedema without weals, this CSU subtype can be
referred to as idiopathic angioedema.* Angioedema results from
increased vascular permeability followed by swelling of subcutaneous or submucosal tissues. Angioedema in CSU is believed to be
histamine-induced, while other angioedema subtypes, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor-related angioedema
and hereditary angioedema, are driven by the vasoactive peptide
bradykinin.* ACE inhibitors prevent the breakdown of bradykinin, increasing bradykinin half-life. In HAE-1 and HAE-2, bradykinin levels are increased because patients lack the main inhibitor
of bradykinin production: C1-inhibitor (C1-INH, HAE-1) or have
dysfunctional C1-INH (HAE-2).? C1-INH inhibits activated factor XII (FXlla) and plasma kallikrein (PKa). FXlla converts plasma
prekallikrein (PK) into PKa that will cleave bradykinin from high
molecular weight kininogen (HK) °; this enzyme system is called
the contact system. Therefore, C1-INH deficiency results in uncontrolled bradykinin production.

The various subtypes of angioedema are classified as bradykinin induced or mast cell induced. Clinically, bradykinin- and histamine-mediated swellings are indistinguishable. Especially when
weals and angioedema coincide, swellings are considered mast cell
and not bradykinin induced.*” However, research in anaphylaxis
suggests that mast cell activation and bradykinin release co-exist. A
study performed in wasp-venom allergic individuals demonstrated
increased markers of bradykinin generation. After a wasp sting,
markers increased in those with severe anaphylaxis, for example angioedema and/or shock, while markers were low prior to the sting
and in individuals with a mild response.® In addition, activation of
the fibrinolytic system was also observed during anaphylaxis as plasmin-antiplasmin (PAP) complexes increased.’ Later studies found
increased levels of cleaved high molecular weight kininogen (cHK),
a marker for bradykinin release, in patients visiting the emergency
medicine department with a (food or drug) allergic response *° and
explained these observations demonstrating bradykinin involve
ment during anaphylaxis in mouse models.’°*? Mast cell-released

heparin was found to activate FXII** connecting mast cell activation
to bradykinin release as FXlla activity will lead to PKa activity and
HK cleavage. While histamine is primarily released from mast cells
or basophils, the contact system is always present in circulation.
Contact system activation is not only limited to excretion of mast
cell-released heparin but can also be triggered by, among others,

13.14 and

platelet polyphosphate,’* activation of the endothelium
neutrophil extracellular traps.>

Little is known about bradykinin generation in CSU, as it is generally considered a mast cell- and histamine-mediated disease. We
recently developed a sensitive ELISA-based method to assess CHK
generation.’° Using this method, we revisited CHK generation in
CSU. In addition, C1-INH in complex with FXlla or PKa were determined, as well as markers of the fibrinolytic system as these were

previously associated with mast cell activation in anaphylaxis.”

2 | METHODS
2.1 | Study participants and blood collection

All patients with a diagnosis of CSU defined as having spontaneous, recurrent weals and/or angioedema for at least 6 weeks, visiting the dermatology and allergology outpatient department, were
asked to provide blood samples at first and selected follow-up visits. This study was approved by the local ethical committee (protocol#13-272). Of these, all patients with written informed consent
and at least one collected sample at first visit between January
2014 and February 2016 were included and data were analysed
for this study. Patient characteristics (age, sex, CSU subtype, disease severity, treatment) were retrieved from medical records by
the physician of the research team. In CSU patients that presented
with angioedema without weals, HAE-1 and HAE-2 were excluded
based upon medical history, family history and C4 levels as part of
routine clinical care. This CSU subtype is referred to as idiopathic
angioedema throughout this article.* Disease severity was categorized into 1) symptom-free: complete disease control for at least
one month, 2) mild: recent symptoms but no need for additional
treatment and 3) moderate to severe: recent symptoms, need for
additional treatment and/or frequent use of rescue medication.
When available, the urticaria control test (UCT) score was collected.” During the timeframe of this study, the UCT was not yet
collected routinely at every visit. Antihistamine resistance was de
fined as persistent symptoms despite using a four times daily dose

of antihistamines; need for add-on therapy such as cyclosporine
and omalizumab; or frequent need for oral steroids in addition to
antihistamine prophylaxis.

Venipuncture was performed at inclusion during a regular control visit at the outpatient clinic. One additional blood draw was performed in 20 patients during random control visits, two additional
blood draws in two patients and three additional blood draws in one
patient.

Blood was collected in standard blood collection tubes containing 1.8 mg EDTA per ml blood and specific sample collection/
anticoagulant tubes (SCAT) containing 25 4M PPACK (Phe-ProArg-chloromethylketone, Sigma-Aldrich), 11 mM sodium citrate and
0.1% mannitol (w/v) to prevent post-blood draw enzymatic activity
in samples. Blood was centrifuged at 2000 g for 10 minutes shortly
after blood draw and stored at -80 until use. We previously reported
cHK measurements in HAE-1 and HAE-2. Samples were collected
in serine protease inhibitor-containing tubes.*¢ As we collected our
samples from CSU patients in the same way, we used these HAE
analyses for comparison.

In addition, plasma from healthy donors was collected (with
written informed consent; approval by the local ethical committee of the University Medical Center Utrecht; protocol#07-125).
Blood was collected in standard sodium citrate tubes (10% sodium
citrate, 3.2% wt/vol). Blood was centrifuged twice at 2000 g for
10 minutes shortly after blood draw and stored at -80 until use.
Plasma from ~30 healthy donors was pooled for control pooled
plasma, and plasma from 28 patients was stored individually for

control plasma.

ELISA, as previously published. cHK levels, FXlla-C1-INH, PKa-C1INH and PAP complexes in patients were determined in citrated
plasma containing PPACK to prevent post-blood draw contact activation, and suPAR levels were determined in EDTA plasma. cHK
and C1-INH complex measurements are expressed as percentages.

(Hematologic Technology) at 37°C for 10 minutes after which reaction was stopped by diluting plasma 64x in a phosphate-buffered
saline buffer (mPBSt: 127.9 mmol/L NaCl, 6.2 mmol/L Na,HPO,,
3.7 mmol/L NaH,PO,, pH 7.0 supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20

curves were created by mixing 100% activated plasma with unac
tivated control pooled plasma both diluted in mPBSt containing

PPACK. Plasma dilution in calibration curves was equal to plasma
dilution of patient samples.1°7®

For 25 patients, tryptase levels were determined as a routine
diagnostic via ImmunoCAP using the Phadia250 (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). These levels were retrieved from medical records. For
14/25 patients, blood was collected for tryptase determination at
the same day as collection of study samples that were used for CHK

determination.

2.3 | Data analysis

GraphPad Prism 8 was used for data analysis. CHK and C1-INH
complex levels were interpolated from a calibration curve using
a sigmoidal 4PL fit model. The first collected sample per patient
was included for analysis unless indicated otherwise. Groups
were compared using Mann-Whitney t test or Wilcoxon test for
paired samples and multiple groups with Kruskal-Wallis test using
Dunn's correction for multiple testing. Correlation was tested with

Spearman's rank test.

3 | RESULTS

Eighty-eight patients were included (70% female; mean age 44 years,
range 18-78), and clinical data and blood samples from 117 visits
were collected (Table 1). Twenty-eight samples from healthy donors
were included as controls (74% female; mean age 39 years, range
23-65). Thirty-nine patients had weals (44%), 35 (40%) patients had
both weals and angioedema, and 14 (16%) patients had angioedema
without weals (referred to as idiopathic angioedema). At first visit
in this study, the majority of patients received prophylactic therapy
with antihistamines (n = 65, 74%) and most patients (n = 83, 97%)
received antihistamine prophylaxis somewhere over the course of
their disease, either in the past or after first visit. Of these patients,
27 (32%) reported improvement upon antihistamine prophylaxis.
Further prophylactic treatment at first visit was omalizumab (n = 11,
13%), steroids (n = 7, 8%) and leukotriene antagonists (n = 5, 6%).
Eighteen patients (20%) did not receive any prophylaxis but all had
on-demand treatment available also mainly consisting of antihistamines (Table 1). Most patients (n = 59, 67%) described moderate to
severe symptoms at first visit, needing additional therapy. Four (5%)
patients were symptom-free at first visit. When analysing all visits
including follow-up visits, 16 (14%) patients reported to be symptom-free (Table 1).

significantly increased compared to healthy controls (median 6.0%
range: 0%-19.9% P = .0056) and comparable to previously determined cHK levels in HAE-1 and HAE-2 *¢ (n = 46, median 10.3%,
range 0%-44.3%, P > .9999, Figure 1A).

When classifying by disease severity, CHK levels in healthy controls were significantly lower than in CSU patients with mild symptoms (median cHK 10.6% range 1.4%-17.2%, P < .0001, Figure 1B)
and moderate to severe symptoms (median cHK 9.0% range 2.7%18.71%, P = .0043) but not compared to symptom-free patients
(median cHK 6.5% range 1.5%-20.8%, P > .9999, Figure 1B). cHK
levels in symptom-free patients were significantly lower than in
patients with mild symptoms (P = .0296) and lower compared to
patients with moderate to severe symptoms. However, the difference between symptom-free patients and those with moderate
to severe symptoms was not statistically significant (P = .3018,

Figure 1B). An urticaria control test (UCT) score was reported at

31 visits. The average score was 11 (SD + 5.6) and trended towards
a negative correlation with cHK (P = .06, r = -.28, Supplemental
Figure 1). There were no differences in CHK levels among patients
with weals, weals and angioedema or idiopathic angioedema
(P = .91, Figure 1C).

In three patients with idiopathic angioedema, one or more
samples were collected during an angioedema attack. All of these
patients experienced a high attack frequency with 2 to 10 attacks
monthly while using antihistamine prophylaxis of 1-4 times the
daily recommended dose. In addition, one of these patients received tranexamic acid and one tranexamic acid and omalizumab
which only led to partial improvement of symptoms. No increase
in cHK could be observed in samples collected during an angioedema attack compared to samples in between attacks (P = .42,
Figure 1D).

Furthermore, no differences could be observed among CSU
patients with good response to prophylactic antihistamine therapy
and patients with insufficient response to antihistamine therapy
(P = .9269, Figure 1E). Tryptase levels were routinely determined
in 25 patients as part of their diagnostic work-up to rule out systemic mastocytosis. In 24 patients, tryptase was within the normal
range (defined as levels < 11.4 ug/L), and in one patient, tryptase
levels were elevated but further diagnostic work-up did not change
the CSU diagnosis. For 14 patients, tryptase was determined at the
moment of sample collection for CHK measurement. When analysing these 14 samples, we found a moderate negative correlation
(r = -.65, P = .0137, n = 14, Figure 1F) between cHK levels and tryptase levels. There was no correlation among cHK and tryptase levels
if samples for analysis were collected on another day (r = -.0636,
P = 8603, n = 11, Supplemental Figure 2A) and a moderate correlation if all available data on tryptase levels were combined (r= -.4435,
P = .0264, n = 25 Supplemental Figure 2B).

FXlla-C1-INH and PKa-C1-INH complex levels were mainly
below detection limits in patients and healthy controls (Figure 2).
Distribution of cHK levels among age and sex was analysed but no
relation with age or sex was found (Figure S3).

We analysed changes in CHK levels detected in samples collected
from the same patients over time. In only 11 of the 23 cases, disease severity corresponded to cHK levels (Figure $4: A, B, C, L, N, O, Q, R, S, T
and V demonstrate cases with corresponding cHK and severity levels),
where change in cHK was defined as >4% difference. Disease severity
and cHK levels per patient, including additional information on immunosuppressive therapy and omalizumab used per time-point, are shown

in Figure S4 (red lines indicate disease severity, and blue lines CHK).

3.2 | Plasmin-antiplasmin levels are increased in

Activation of the fibrinolytic system was analysed by measurement of
PAP complexes and suPAR levels. We observed increased PAP levels
in CSU patients compared to healthy controls (P =< .0001). This dif

4 | DISCUSSION

We evaluated if there is evidence for bradykinin release in CSU and
found that cHK, a marker for bradykinin production, was elevated in
CSU patients compared to healthy controls. cHK levels normalized
in patients that were in disease remission. Moreover, the observed
increases in CHK levels were comparable to previously determined
levels in HAE-1 and HAE-2. Increased cHK was not limited to CSU
patients with angioedema and not associated with antihistamine
responsiveness. However, cHK was inversely correlated to tryptase
levels. In addition, PAP-complex levels were also increased reflecting
fibrinolytic activity in CSU.

The increase in cHK levels observed in this CSU cohort was
within the healthy control range, roughly not surpassing 20% cHK.
This raises the question if the cHK increase observed is of possible
clinical relevance. To some extent, bradykinin release appears to
be a physiological process, as CHK is detectable in healthy individuals. Cleaved HK only moderately discriminates between healthy
individuals and those with bradykinin driven disease (HAE-1 and
HAE-2). However, the cHK increase detected in CSU was comparable to levels detected in HAE-1 and HAE-2 patients, suggesting
possible clinical relevance. The here-reported cHK levels in HAE-1
and HAE-2 are lower than described in previous studies,1°212? and
this can be explained by the use of protease inhibitor blood collection tubes in this study preventing post-blood draw ex vivo CHK
generation. Moreover, we previously found that a slight rise of CHK
within the range of healthy controls could indicate an angioedema
attack in individual HAE patients.’7" It is therefore possible that
the overall slightly increased cHK levels in CSU do reflect patholog
ical bradykinin release.

Previous studies to CSU only investigated bradykinin levels or HK
degradation in very small numbers of patients and were limited to
cases with angioedema. One study reported no decrease in HK antigen
on Western blot in 7 cases with idiopathic angioedema.”° This different
outcome can be explained by the sensitivity of cHK detection versus
loss of HK antigen on Western blot. Another study observed decreased
HK levels in 10 patients with angioedema provoked by oral contraceptive intake, notably 8 of them also reported weals, symptoms improved
and HK normalized after cessation of oral contraceptives.2° Evidence
is surfacing that bradykinin contributes to idiopathic angioedema that
is unresponsive to antihistamine therapy (idiopathic non-histaminergic angioedema). Increased bradykinin levels were detected in four
cases of idiopathic non-histaminergic angioedema during angioedema
attacks.7* Moreover, ex vivo plasma stimulation with a FXII activator
in patients with idiopathic non-histaminergic angioedema resulted in
increased PKa activity,2° suggesting increased sensitivity to bradykinin
production. Both studies did not found increased bradykinin levels or
sensitivity to bradykinin production in idiopathic angioedema patients
that did responded to antihistamine therapy (idiopathic histaminergic
angioedema).?°° We determined cHK in three patients with idiopathic angioedema during an acute attack but did not observe a further
increase in cHK. All three showed no clear benefit from antihistamine
therapy but two continued to have a partial and complete response
to omalizumab suggesting mast cell involvement in their disease pathology. Our findings appear to be in line with previous observations
in idiopathic histaminergic angioedema as the cHK increase detected
is subtle and within the range of healthy controls. However, using our
sensitive method of cHK detection we observed a possible clinically
relevant difference and are the first to report elevated CHK levels in
CSU, unrelated to the occurrence of angioedema.

We hypothesized that mast cell activity is the cause of increased
CHK levels in CSU. A causal relation between mast cell activity and contact activation in allergy was repeatedly demonstrated before.?*”
Tryptase is a marker for mast cell degranulation that is used in the clinic
as a biomarker in anaphylaxis and mastocytosis. In this study, we found
that cHK negatively correlated to tryptase levels. At the moment, we
do not know the mechanism behind this inverse correlation. However,
it is noteworthy that human mast cell tryptase has the ability to cleave
HK at multiple sites.7° It is possible that this destroys the immunoreactive epitope for the antibodies that recognize cHK in our ELISA.

Furthermore, it remains uncertain if mast cell degranulation is
the source of cHK production in CSU. Previous work showed a positive correlation between tryptase and cHK in anaphylaxis.’° To confirm our finding in CSU, replication in a larger cohort is necessary, as
only limited data were available.

Involvement of the fibrinolytic system in CSU is topic of debate. The fibrin degradation product D-dimer is associated with
CSU, and it correlates with disease severity and antihistamine-resistant urticaria.27°° However, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), suPAR and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were not
elevated in one study in CSU patients.°* We add to these previous
observations our finding of increased PAP-complex levels in CSU

compared to healthy controls. There is a large bout of evidence

demonstrating that activation of the fibrinolytic system and contact system go hand in hand.?*®92°5 Moreover, mast cells are
pointed out as a source of fibrinolysis via excretion of tissue plasminogen activator, fibrinogenolytic properties of béta-tryptase °°
and expression of uPAR.°” With this study, we could not establish a
correlation between PAP levels and cHK. This may be explained by
a mismatch in half-life of circulating CHK and circulating PAP levels.
Moreover, PAP-complex levels were still increased in CSU patients
in disease remission. This may reflect lingering mast cell activity.
Alternatively, the presence of hyperfibrinolysis may predispose the
development of CSU. Efficacy of a combination of low molecular
weight heparin and the antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid was
suggested in one pilot study including 8 antihistamine-resistant
CSU patients.°%

Whether our observation of increased cHK generation is of
clinical relevance in CSU or cHK is just an innocent bystander requires investigations. We can only speculate that increased bradykinin turnover in CSU, as reflected by our biomarker study, may
contribute to increased vasopermeability, possibly priming the vasculature for events leading to weals and/or angioedema. A recent
case series including two CSU patients described that relapse in
symptoms after initial successful omalizumab treatment drastically
improved after cessation of ACE inhibitors. It was suggested that
ACE inhibitors, which increase bradykinin levels, contributed to
disease severity in these two CSU cases.°? In our cohort, we could
not demonstrate a direct relation between antihistamine resistance
and cHK levels. Notably, only 32% of patients reported benefit of
antihistamine therapy. A referral bias is possible, as patients truly

FIGURE 4 Cleaved HK levels and biomarkers of the fibrinolytic system do not correlate. Cleaved HK (cHK), plasmin-antiplasmin (PAP)
and soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) were determined by ELISA. cHK plotted against A, PAP levels and B,
suPAR levels. C, suPAR levels plotted against PAP levels. Spearman's rank test was used

responsive to antihistamine therapy would not have been referred
to our tertiary treatment centre. We suspect that increased bradykinin release may aggravate histamine-driven symptoms in CSU.
Mast cell-released heparin is a likely source of contact activation
in CSU, but we cannot exclude involvement of other triggers for
bradykinin production such as platelets 1? or endothelial cells.1°**
We here report on increased cHK levels in CSU reflecting increased bradykinin release. CSU is considered a multifactorial,
mast cell-mediated disease, and we cautiously introduce the idea of
including bradykinin in this multifactorial model. If and to what ex
tent bradykinin indeed contributes to CSU remains to be answered.
