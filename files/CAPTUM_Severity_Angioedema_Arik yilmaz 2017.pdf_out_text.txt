ABSTRACT

Background: There is little information regarding the etiology and natural course of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU)
in childhood.

Objective: To investigate the etiology, prognosis, and the factors associated with the prognosis of CSU in children.

Method: Data from children with CSU who had been diagnosed between 1992 and 2015 were analyzed. A telephone interview
was done to assess the current status of these patients. Remission was defined as the disappearance of urticaria for >6 months.

Results: A total of 222 children with CSU were evaluated. The median age of symptom onset was 8.8 years (interquartile
range [IQR], 4.6—12.3 years), median duration of urticaria was 23 months (IQR, 7-48 months), and the median sum of the
daily urticaria activity score of 7 consecutive days (UAS7) was 28 (IQR, 21-42). Accompanying angioedema was reported by
107 patients (48.2%), whereas 27.1% of the study population had autoantibody positivity. Autologous serum skin testing
results were positive in 43 (34.1%), skin-prick testing results revealed atopy in 55 children (27.9%). Parasites (4.8%), pollen
sensitization (1.5%), food allergy (0.9%), urinary tract infection (0.9%), and Hashimoto thyroiditis (0.5%) were determined
as etiologic factors of CSU. The patients were followed up for a median time of 15 months (IQR, 5-36.5 months). Remission
was observed in 10.6, 29.3, and 44.5% of the patients in 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. In multivariate regression analysis,
a UAS7 of >28 at admission was found to be a risk factor for persistence of urticaria (odds ratio 6.22 [95% confidence interval,
1.54-25.15; p = 0.010).

Conclusion: The etiology of CSU in children was mostly idiopathic despite detailed investigation. In childhood, the natural
course of CSU was favorable, and nearly half of the patients recovered after 5 years of disease duration. A high UAS7 at

admission seemed to be a significant risk factor for the persistence of symptoms.

Ee though a lifetime prevalence of acute urticaria
is as high as 20% in the general population,
relapsing or persistent urticaria is rare. Chronic urticaria is defined as daily or an almost daily appearance
of urticarial symptoms, with or without angioedema,
that lasted for >6 weeks,! which affects 0.5-1% of the
general population.” There is no information regarding
its true prevalence in childhood, but chronic urticaria is
thought to be less common in children than adults.
Chronic urticaria is classified as inducible chronic urticaria, which is triggered by specific physical stimuli,
(e.g., cold, heat, pressure) and chronic spontaneous
urticaria (CSU), which occurs without any physical
triggers.’ Although CSU seems to be a benign disease;

it has been shown that impairment of quality of life is
comparable with children with other chronic diseases.°

CSU has been well documented in adults; however,
there is limited knowledge regarding the underlying
cause in childhood. The etiology could not be identified in more than half of children in the few published
studies, which also include physical urticaria.* Also,
the natural course of CSU in children within various
age groups, follow-up periods or the definition of disease and/or remission criteria have not been investigated in detail.°* Previously, we analyzed 100 children
with CSU and found that girls >10 years of age may
have an unfavorable prognosis.” In this study, we
aimed to extend our study by including a larger number of patients with a longer duration of follow-up, and
analyzed the factors associated with prognosis in childhood CSU. We also searched the severity of disease as
a potential predictor of persistence.

METHODS

Study Population

This study was conducted in the Department of Pediatric Allergy, Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey, between 1992 and 2015, and had

March-April 2017, Vol. 38, No. 2
both retrospective and prospective aspects. Data from
children who had been diagnosed as having CSU between 1992 and 2009 were collected and analyzed retrospectively; patients who were admitted to our department after 2010 and diagnosed as having CSU
were evaluated prospectively. CSU was defined as the
daily or almost daily spontaneous appearance of urticaria that lasted for >6 weeks.’ Patients with physical
urticaria, which was triggered by a specific physical
stimulus, were excluded. The urticaria activity score
(UAS) was used to assess the disease activity in all the
participants according to the EAACI/' GA?LEN/EDE/
WAO guideline’, and was calculated by the sum of the
daily scores for 7 consecutive days (UAS7) in patients
before admission. This study was approved by Hacettepe University Ethics Committee.

Demographic features, including sex and age, the
age at symptom onset, UAS7 at admission, whether or
not angioedema was present, concomitant symptoms
other than urticaria or angioedema, accompanying allergic diseases, chronic diseases, a family history of
allergic diseases, and laboratory findings on admission
and at follow-up were recorded. Telephone interviews
were performed to review the current status of urticaria of the participants. We used a mini-questionnaire,
which included the date of the last urticarial symptoms; the medications taken; and concomitant symptoms, such as gastrointestinal (e.g., abdominal pain
and/or cramp, diarrhea, mucus or blood in stool, anal
pruritus, and emesis) or general (e.¢., loss of appetite,
fatigue, and fever) in a telephone interview. Remission
was defined as the disappearance of urticaria for at
least 6 months.

Laboratory Investigations

All the children underwent extensive laboratory investigations, including a complete blood cell count;
C-reactive protein level; erythrocyte sedimentation
rate; total immunoglobulin E (IgE) level; C3 and C4
levels; thyroid hormones, including thyroid stimulating hormone and free T4 levels; thyroid autoantibodies
(antithyroid peroxisomal, antithyroglobulin, and anti—
thyroid stimulating hormone antibodies); antinuclear
antibody; anti- double-stranded DNA antibody; urine
analysis; and stool examination for parasites. Urine
analysis was performed as automated urinalysis and
direct microscopy. In case of any abnormality in these
tests, further tests or consultation with relevant departments were performed as indicated. If a specific disease was diagnosed based on the laboratory tests mentioned above, then specific treatment was given by the
consultant department, and treatment response was
observed for relevance between test abnormality and
urticarial symptoms. If there was no specific underlying disease, then second-generation antihistamines

Allergy and Asthma Proceedings

were given and treatment was organized according to
the current guidelines.’

Skin-Prick Test Procedure

A skin-prick test (SPT) was performed with common
allergens: Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, Alternaria, cat epithelia, dog epithelia,
Blattella germanica, grass mixture (Phleum pratense, Poa
pratensis, Dactylis glomerata, Lolium perenne, Festuca pratensis, and Avena elatior), tree mixture (Betula verrucosa,
Alnus glutinosa, and Corylus avellana), Olea europaea,
cow’s milk, soya, wheat, peanut, hazelnut, egg white,
egg yolk, and histamine (10 mg/mL of histamine phosphate) as the positive control; and 0.9% sterile saline
solution as the negative control. The SPT result was
considered positive if the mean wheal diameter was
=3 mm compared with the negative control. When
there was suspicion of another food that was not listed
above as a trigger of urticaria in patient’s history, SPT
was also performed with that culprit food. All positive
SPT results were evaluated for relevance to urticarial
symptoms. In the case of aeroallergen sensitization, the
patients were queried about an increase of symptoms
by allergen exposure. In case of any positivity with SPT
results and/or specific IgE levels with culprit food, oral
food challenge was performed to confirm a food allergy. When there was a suspicion of a drug as a trigger
in the patient’s history, the SPTs and/or intradermal
tests were applied, if available, and oral provocation
tests were performed to investigate the drug allergy.

Autologous Serum Skin Test Procedure

An autologous serum skin test (ASST) was performed with 0.05 mL of sterile, fresh autologous serum,
and 0.9% sterile saline solution as a negative control.
Thirty minutes after the intradermal injection of serum,
wheal and flare reactions were measured, and a wheal
diameter of =1.5 mm than the control was considered
as a positive result.”

Statistical Analyses

All data were analyzed with SPSS statistical software, version 18.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). The proportions in different groups were compared by using the
Pearson * test or the Fisher exact test, when appropriate. All numeric variables were compared with MannWhitney U or Kruskal-Wallis tests, when appropriate;
the results are given as median and interquartile
ranges (IQR). Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed
for persistence of CSU in all of the patients by using the
standard log-rank test. The factors related to the resolution of CSU were determined by a Cox regression.
The risk factors for the persistence of CSU were determined by univariate analysis and then multivariate
logistic regression analysis, and the results were given

RESULTS

A total of 222 patients with CSU were evaluated.
Baseline characteristics of patients are given in Table 1.
The median ages of children at the onset of urticarial
symptoms and at admission were 8.8 years (IQR, 4.6—
12.3 years) and 10.1 years (IQR, 6.4—13.2 years), respectively. The median duration of urticaria was 23 months
(IQR, 7-48 months), and the median UAS7 at admission was 28 (IQR, 21-42). At admission, 107 of patients
(48.2%) also had angioedema and 37 (16.7%) had concomitant allergic diseases. A family history of allergic
diseases was observed in 25% of the patients. The
medians of the leukocyte and eosinophil counts were
within normal limits: only 2.3% of the patients had a
high eosinophil count, and 9.8% had a high eosinophil
percentage in peripheral blood. Total IgE levels were
>100 U/L in 65 patients (37.8%). Decreased levels of
C3 or C4 were found in nine patients (4.1%), but none
had an abnormal level or function of C1 esterase inhibitor (Table 2).

138

Ten patients (5.1%) had an abnormal urine test result, and three of them had positive urine culture results. However, only one patient’s urticaria (0.9%) disappeared after antibiotic treatment and was considered
urinary tract infection—associated urticaria. Parasites in
stool were found in 19 patients (10.2%), and treatment
was given according to the type of parasite. Urticaria
resolved completely in nine patients (4.8%) and was
considered to be parasite-associated urticaria. Detected
causative parasites were Blastocystis hominis (n = 5),
Giardia lamblia (n = 3), and Dientomobea fragilis (n = 1).
Only nine children with CSU (4.9%) had abnormal
thyroid function test results, and 13 (6.7%) had positive
thyroid autoantibody results. Four patients were diagnosed as having Hashimoto thyroiditis, three of whom
were euthyroid; therefore, treatment was not given.
L-thyroxin regimen was indicated in only one patient
(0.5%), and urticaria disappeared after treatment.

A total of 55 patients (27.1%) had positive autoantibodies. The patients with positive antinuclear antibody
or anti-double-stranded DNA antibody results were
evaluated for autoimmune diseases, but none of them
were diagnosed as having a specific rheumatologic
disease at the time of the analysis. Autologous serum
skin testing was performed in 123 patients (55.4%), and
43 (34.1%) had positive results. SPTs were performed
on 197 patients (88.7%) and 55 children (27.9%); the
results were positive. Only three patients who were
pollen sensitized developed urticaria exclusively during pollen season and was recognized as pollen-associated CSU. Four patients had positive SPT results with
food. After 2 weeks of elimination diet by excluding
offending food, oral food challenge revealed definite
food allergies to cow’s milk and egg in two of the
children (0.9%). A total of 18 patients stated, in their
history, a drug as a trigger of urticaria, and all of them
were evaluated for drug allergy by skin tests, if available, and oral provocation tests, but none of them had
been diagnosed as having a drug allergy.

The patients were followed up for a median of 15
months (IQR, 5-36.5 months). Information about the
current status of urticarial symptoms was obtained in
190 of the patients (85.6%); 60 (31.6%) were in remission. According to the Kaplan-Meier analysis, remission was seen in 10.6, 29.3 and 44.5% of the patients in
1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. The probability of persistence of urticarial symptoms was significantly
higher in children with UAS7 of >28 at admission than
children with =28 according to the Kaplan-Meier analysis (p < 0.0001, log- rank test, Mantel-Cox test) (Fig. 1
B). The risk factors for persistence of urticarial symptoms were investigated with univariate and multivariate logistic regression, and UAS7 of >28 at admission
was significantly associated with persistence of urticaria (odds ratio 6.22 [95% confidence interval, 1.54—
25.15; p = 0.010]) (Table 3).

DISCUSSION

Our study revealed some key information regarding
he etiology, prognosis, and prognostic factors in childhood CSU within a large cohort and long-term followup. The underlying cause of CSU could be identified in
8.8% of our patients. In addition, the autoimmune
background was determined in 34% of the children.
Remission was attained in nearly half of the children
after 5 years of symptom duration. A UAS7 of >28 at
admission was a significant predictive factor that influenced persistence of urticaria.

Although there are many studies that investigated
he etiology of chronic urticaria, most of data was
related to adults. Among a few studies concerning
childhood CSU, the proportion of patients whose underlying cause of chronic urticaria was identified varies between 6 and 55%.°*~? However, inducible urticaria as an etiology was included in most of these
studies. This rate was found to be low as 6-14% ina
few studies that excluded physical urticaria.>!

In our study, the etiology could be determined in
only 8.8% of the patients, despite detailed clinical history, physical examination, extensive laboratory investigations, and challenge tests. Each suspected causative

 

Allergy and Asthma Proceedings

factor was evaluated carefully in terms of being a real
trigger. If there was no clear relationship between abnormal tests or suspected factors and CSU, or was not
confirmed by challenge tests or treatment response of
diagnosed specific disease, then suspected factors or
abnormal test were not accepted as a causative factor.
This approach might be the reason for the low diagnosis rate of etiology in our study.

In our cohort, parasitic infestation was the most common causative factor of CSU in 4.8% of children. Parasites in stool examinations of children with chronic
urticaria was found in 2.4% by Kauppinien et al.,? 2.5%
by Du Toit et al.,)> 2.7% by Sahiner et al.,> 3.7% by
Volonakis et al.,'° and 5.4% by Jirapongsananuruk et
al.'*, however, improvement of symptoms after antiparasite treatment was only established in a few studies.
In a recent systematic review that assessed the prevalence and relevance of parasitic infections in patients
with CSU, it was stated that pediatric patients with
parasites ranged from 0 to 37.8%.'° Concurrent gastrointestinal symptoms, previous parasitic infection, traveling abroad, and unexplained peripheral eosinophilia
might point out the presence of parasite infection in a
patient with CSU. However, the types of parasites or

effects of treatment of parasitic infection on CSU were
not mentioned in most of the research.

The prevalence of food allergy in children with
chronic urticaria was determined to be 1-2.7% in studies that performed confirmation of food allergy by oral
food challenges after a period of food elimination.>*°
In our study, food allergy was found to be the causative factor in only 0.9% of children based on doubleblind placebo-controlled oral food challenge and re

mission criteria of CSU. The parents frequently
thought that foods were responsible for chronic urticaria symptoms. Elimination of the culprit food from a
child’s diet was already done by most of parents at
admission. Nevertheless, IgE-mediated food allergies
rarely cause chronic urticarial symptoms. Occasionally,
urticaria may persist when the allergic food consumption was continued even in trace amounts. For similar
reasons, drug allergies also rarely cause chronic urti

caria.* In our cohort, drug allergy was inquired by
clinical history but was not determined as an etiologic
factor of CSU after provocation tests.

Even though infections may frequently cause acute

urticaria in childhood’®; there is no clear evidence regarding the association between infections and chronic
urticaria.!”"5 The prevalence of infections related to
chronic urticaria in children was reported as 2% by
Harris et al.8 and as 4.4% by Volonakis et al.'° In our
study, only one child underwent remission after treatment of urinary infection. Therefore, infections seem to
be a causative factor in a small number of children with
CSU.
Aeroallergen sensitization—associated chronic urticaria has been assessed in a few studies. It was shown
hat adults with chronic urticaria had more skin test
result positivity with aeroallergens compared with
hose adults without chronic urticaria.'? Volonakis et
al.'° found that aeroallergen sensitization was relevant,
with CSU in 2.2% of the children. Although SPT posiivity with aeroallergens was detected in >50 patients
in our cohort, sensitization was relevant to CSU sympoms in only three children. In addition, those patients
also had allergic rhinitis symptoms. Therefore, it may
be useful to investigate aeroallergen sensitization in
case of urticarial symptoms with a seasonal pattern
and the existence of allergic rhinitis symptoms.

Studies that indicated the association between autoimmune thyroid diseases and chronic urticaria mainly
concerned adults.7°7! Levy et al. showed the increased levels of antithyroid antibodies in 4.3% of children and adolescents with chronic urticaria at admission or at their follow-up; however, none of these
patients had remission of urticaria after treatment of
their thyroid disease. Other studies on childhood
chronic urticaria reported none or only one patient
who had been associated with thyroid autoimmunitye2ds* In our cohort, 4.9% of the patients had. abnormal thyroid hormone levels and 6.7% had positive
serum thyroid autoantibodies; but the causative association was revealed in only one patient who had been
diagnosed as having Hashimoto thyroiditis. Thyroid
disease—associated CSU seems to be rare in childhood,
even in the case of abnormal thyroid tests.

Nearly 40% of patients with chronic urticaria had
circulating functional autoantibodies directed against
IgE or epitopes in the a-chain of the high-affinity IgE
receptor, which leads to mast cell degranulation and
histamine release.”* Brunetti et al.'' demonstrated a
good correlation between the ASST and the basophil
activation test in children with chronic urticaria,
whereas the ASST result was found to be positive in
38-47%.5111514 However, there were differences in
inclusion criteria regarding age ranges or the definition
of disease, and some studies included physical urticaria. In our cohort, the ASST result was found to be

 

Allergy and Asthma Proceedings

positive in 34.1% of patients, and there was no association between ASST positivity and activity or persistence of CSU. ASST is a practical and reasonable test to
assess the autoimmune background of CSU. However,
it is still unclear whether or not it affects clinical symptoms and prognosis of the disease.

Differences about identified underlying causes in
those studies may be due to differences in the methodology or inclusion criteria, such as the definition of
disease and age ranges. In addition, to date, the proportion of patients with identified etiology is very low
in studies of childhood CSU, including our study.
These results supported the opinion that routine laboratory testing may not be required when investigating
the etiology in all the patients.

Only a few studies investigated the natural course of
CSU in children. However, there were many differences about the definition of the disease and remission
criteria, and follow-up periods and age ranges of children. In a study in which remission criteria were considered as an urticaria-free period for >6 months, 58%
of the children went into remission in a 1-year follow-up period, which also involved physical urticaria.®
Previously, we reported that recovery was seen in 16.5,
38.8, and 50.0% of the children after 12, 36, and 60
months, respectively, with the same remission criteria>
In another study, with a remission criterion of 12
months and that included only 4-15-year-old children,
the rates of remission were 8.5, 54, and 67.7% of children at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively.’ Hiragun et al.®
retrospectively analyzed 117 children and adults with
CSU that was insufficiently controlled by a standard
dose of antihistamine. In that study, the remission
criterion was considered as a 1-month urticaria-free
period, and the remission rate was found as 36.6, 51.2,
and 66.1% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. Taken
together, CSU has a better prognosis in children compared with adults. Although childhood CSU has a
favorable natural course, no statistically significant
prognostic factor could be identified in these studies.
In our previous study, resolution rate was found to be
worse in girls >10 years old at univariate analysis, but
it was not statistically significant at multivariate analysis.° In a recent systematic review, plasma levels of
prothrombin, D-dimer, and C-reactive protein were
found to be probable markers of the severity and duration of CSU.”*

In the present study, a UAS7 of >28 at admission
was found to be a significant predictive factor relevant
to the persistence of symptoms. Moreover, the probability of the persistence of CSU was significantly increased in children with a UAS7 of >28 compared with
children with a score of =28. Until now, to our knowledge, there was no study that investigated the effect of
severity of urticaria at admission on the natural course
in childhood CSU. The UAS is proposed to assess the

 

 

141
disease activity in patients with CSU by using the
recent guidelines." The absence of the control group
might be considered a limitation of this study. However, the primary aim of this study was to determine
the etiologic factors in children in the CSU cohort. The
lack of investigation of some diseases that were previously reported to accompany CSU, e.g., celiac disease,
may be considered as a limitation of the study. The rate
of patients lost to follow-up was 14.4% in our cohort,
but it was lower when compared with other studies.
Nevertheless, this study included the largest cohort
with wide age ranges in childhood.

CONCLUSION

The etiology of CSU in children remained idiopathic
despite detailed investigation. The natural course of
childhood CSU is favorable, with nearly half of the
patients in remission after 5 years of duration. An
increased UAS seemed to be a significant risk factor for
the persistence of symptoms. To our knowledge, this
was the first study showing UAS7 as a predictive factor
on the prognosis of childhood CSU in a large cohort.
