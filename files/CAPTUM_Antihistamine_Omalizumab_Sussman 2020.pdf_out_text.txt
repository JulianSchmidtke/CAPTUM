What is already known about this topic? Phase 3 trials have shown that omalizumab is effective at both doses (150 mg/
300 mg) in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria, with the 300 mg dose showing greater clinical benefit.

What does this article add to our knowledge? After initial omalizumab treatment, symptom control after relapse and retreatment is achieved in almost all patients. Initial benefit is greater with a 300 mg dose than a 150 mg dose; step-up to 300

mg improves symptom control.

How does this study impact current management guidelines? Step-up therapy to 300 mg helps a greater proportion of
patients achieve symptom control, and re-treatment with omalizumab is as effective as initial therapy.

 

BACKGROUND: Omalizumab shows greater clinical benefit
with 300 mg dose than with the 150 mg dose.

OBJECTIVE: To determine outcomes postwithdrawal, relapse,
and re-treatment in omalizumab responders, and from stepping
up to 300 mg after insufficient symptom control with 150 mg.
METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized (3:4), openlabel, noncomparator study (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02161562).
A total of 314 adult patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria
and symptomatic on H,-antihistamines were enrolled between
August 1, 2014, and November 6, 2015. Patients received 150
mg/300 mg omalizumab, every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. Omalizumab 150 mg dose could be stepped up to 300 mg between
week 8 and week 24, if the 7-day sum of the daily Urticaria
Activity Score (UAS7) was more than 6. If patients relapsed after
treatment withdrawal at week 24, they could be re-treated with
the same dose on which omalizumab was started. Patients on

300 mg could extend treatment by 12 weeks if they did not
achieve symptom control on 300 mg in the initial dosing phase.
The primary end point was the proportion of well-controlled
patients who relapsed postwithdrawal, and achieved symptom
control at the end of re-treatment. Symptom control was assessed
using UAS7 (UAS7 S 6 = well controlled).

RESULTS: Overall, 115 of 314 patients had adequate symptom
control at week 24 (end of the initial dosing period) and 56 were
re-treated after relapse postwithdrawal; 87.8% (95% CI, 78.6%96.9%) regained symptomatic control (UAS7 < 6). Most (141 of
178) patients initially treated with 150 mg required step-up to
300 mg, which resulted in a 9.5-point (95% CI, 7.6-11.3)
improvement in UAS7 over the mean change observed initially
on 150 mg.

CONCLUSIONS: Step-up to 300 mg helps a greater proportion
of patients achieve symptom control, and re-treatment with

INTRODUCTION

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is an inflammatory
skin disease characterized by itchy wheals or angioedema, or
both for more than 6 weeks.! Approximately, 40% to 50% of
patients with urticaria experience angioedema at some point
with the disease.” The symptoms of CSU negatively impact
patients’ activities of daily living, social interactions, sleep
quality, and emotional well-being. Across skin diseases, CSU is
ranked among the worst to affect patient’s health-related
quality of life.? Pharmacological treatment of CSU usually
involves nonsedating H,-antihistamines as first-line treatment
and up to 4-fold dose of nonsedating H,-antihistamine as
second-line treatment. In recently updated guidelines for urticaria management, omalizumab has been included as the only
third-line add-on therapy to Hy-antihistamines in patients
unresponsive to H,-antihistamines. Cyclosporine, another addon therapy, in the recent guidelines has been recommended as
a fourth-line treatment after omalizumab treatment. A short
course of glucocorticosteroids may be considered in case of
severe exacerbations.”

Omalizumab is one of the oldest biologics, and received
approval for the treatment of allergic asthma in 2003. Omalizumab received approval as an add-on therapy to H,-antihistamines in patients with chronic inducible urticaria/CSU who are
resistant to H,-antihistamines in Guatemala in 2013, the United
States, Europe, Canada, Argentina, Chile, Dominican Republic,
and Panama in 2014, Brazil in 2015, and Mexico in 2017.” '? In
Canada and the United States, omalizumab may be administered
as a 150 mg or 300 mg subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks.
Because CSU is a chronic and intermittent condition, guidelines
recommend reevaluation of the need for continued or alternative
drug treatment every 3 to 6 months, although the previous phase
3 studies evaluated 12 and 24 weeks of omalizumab treatment,
and physicians are advised to periodically assess patients for the
need for continued treatment. The present phase 3b Efficacy of
Optimized Re-treatment and Step-up Therapy With Omalizumab in Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria Patients (OPTIMA)
study was designed to provide further information on the
optimal approach for omalizumab treatment of patients under
several scenarios. Importantly, if patients achieve symptom

 

SUSSMAN ETAL 2373

control with omalizumab therapy, what would happen if treatment is stopped, and further, if symptoms relapse off therapy
what is the response to re-treatment? Because both 150 mg and
300 mg doses are approved, the study also examined how to
optimally treat patients who do not respond to an initial course
of therapy. If the initial dose was 150 mg, would stepping up to
300 mg improve patient outcomes? Alternatively, if the initial
dose was 300 mg, would extending the duration of treatment
improve patient outcomes? This report presents the results of the
OPTIMA study including primary outcome about re-treatment
along with key secondary outcomes related to relapse and stepup dosing strategy.

METHODS
Study design and setting

This was a phase 3b, randomized, multicenter, international,
open-label, parallel-group, noncomparator study (see Figure El in
this article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org). Adult
patients with CSU and symptomatic despite H,-antihistamine
treatment were randomized to receive either 150 or 300 mg
omalizumab for 24 weeks. All eligible patients were randomized
via interactive response technology to 1 of the 2 treatment arms. A
patient randomization list was produced by the interactive
response technology provider using a validated system that automated the random assignment of patient numbers to randomization numbers. These randomization numbers were linked to the 2
different treatment arms. Patients randomized to the 150 mg dose
had to be stepped up to 300 mg if their symptoms were not
adequately controlled after 8 weeks of treatment (2 doses) or if

 

they lost control any time between 8 and 24 weeks in the initial
treatment period.

Patients then entered 1 of the following phases, on the basis of their
response at 24 weeks: (1) 8-week withdrawal phase (if symptoms were
well controlled at either dose); (2) step-up to 300 mg for 12 weeks
(if 150 mg initially and symptoms were uncontrolled); or (3) extended
treatment for 12 more weeks (if 300 mg initially and symptoms were
uncontrolled by week 24). Symptoms were assessed using the patientreported 7-day sum of daily Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7)'°;
symptom control was defined as UAS7 less than or equal to 6. Relapse
was defined as UAS7 greater than or equal to 16 after experiencing

symptom control and withdrawal from initial therapy.

 

Step-up to 300 mg from 150 mg could occur any time after 8
weeks (2 doses) into the initial treatment period until week 24.
Patients in the withdrawal phase were monitored and re-treated for a
second 12-week course of omalizumab therapy at the randomized
initial dose if a relapse occurred.

The study protocol and its amendment were reviewed by the
independent ethics committee or institutional review board for each
center, and the study was conducted in accordance with the ethical
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided
signed, informed consent before any study procedures being
performed.

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the effect of optimized retreatment after relapse (UAS7 > 16) in patients with CSU who
were clinically well controlled (UAS7 < 6) after the initial dosing

 

period with omalizumab. Secondary objective was to assess the
effect of step-up therapy in patients with CSU who are not
clinically well controlled (UAS7 > 6) after the initial dosing
period with omalizumab 150 mg every 4 weeks. Secondary

objectives also included evaluation of the time to relapse (UAS7
> 16) after withdrawal of omalizumab in patients who were
clinically well controlled (UAS7 < 6) after the initial dosing
period (24 weeks), the benefit of extending study treatment in
patients not clinically well controlled (UAS7 > 6) after the initial
dosing period (24 weeks) with omalizumab 300 mg every 4
weeks, and evaluation of the safety and tolerability of omalizumab
and the efficacy of omalizumab during the initial dosing period.

Statistical analysis and sample size

The primary end point was the proportion of patients who were
clinically well controlled after the initial dosing phase, then relapsed
after treatment withdrawal, and achieved symptom control at the
end of the second dosing phase. A key secondary end point was the
proportion of patients who achieved symptom control (UAS7 < 6)
in the group that stepped up therapy from 150 mg to 300 mg. Other
secondary end points included assessments of the change in the
UAS7 and time to relapse. Analyses were performed on the intentto-treat population, defined as all patients who received at least 1
dose and had at least 1 postbaseline assessment. The sample size was
determined on the basis of statistical assumptions about the UAS7

response rates over the initial treatment period for each dose group as
well as the potential relapse rates after treatment withdrawal, as
described previously in further detail.’ Incorporating these factors,
the study planned to enroll a total of 320 patients in a ratio of 4:3 to
dose groups of 150 mg and 300 mg omalizumab.

RESULTS
Study participants and treatment disposition

A total of 314 patients across 8 countries (Argentina, Canada,
Chile, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Panama, Brazil, and
Mexico) were randomized between August 1, 2014, and
November 6, 2015, when the recruitment goals were met. Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between
the 2 dose groups (Table 1). Most patients (141 of 178 [79.2%])
in the 150 mg dose group were stepped up to the 300 mg dose
before completing the initial 24-week treatment period, resulting
in proportionally different average exposure in the dose groups.
In the 300 mg treatment group, 43 of 136 patients (31.6%) were
not well controlled at the end of the initial treatment period and
entered an extension phase for an additional 3 doses (12 weeks)
of 300 mg omalizumab treatment (Figure 1).

Re-treatment results

Of the 314 patients initially treated, 115 patients achieved
symptom control (UAS7 < 6) after the 24-week treatment
period with 300 mg (n = 88) or 150 mg (n = 27). Of these,
56 patients experienced symptom relapse during the 8-week
period of withdrawal and received re-treatment with the same
initial dose of 150 mg (n = 12) or 300 mg (n = 44) omalizumab; 49 of these patients (87.5%) completed all 3 doses of
re-treatment (Figure 1), On re-treatment, 87.8% of patients
(95% CI, 78.6%-96.9%) regained control of symptoms,
defined as UAS7 less than or equal to 6 (Table II). The mean

UAS7 over the re-treatment period was similar to that in the
initial dosing period for both doses (Figure 2). Furthermore,
for the re-treated patients, the mean time to response with retreatment (3.1 weeks; 95% CI, 2.5-3.7) was similar to that
observed with initial treatment (3.6 weeks; 95% CI, 2.5-4.7)
(Table Il). Of the 56 patients who received re-treatment, data
for symptom control (UAS7 < 6) and complete response
(UAS7 = 0) after the administration of 2 doses were available
for all 56 patients during the initial treatment period, and for
52 patients during re-treatment. Rapid symptom control
(UAS7 < 6) and complete response (UAS7 = 0) were seen

after 2 doses in 80% (45 of 56) and 63% (35 of 56) of patients
during the initial dosing period, respectively. During retreatment, the corresponding numbers were 85% (44 of 52)
and 56% (29 of 52), respectively.

Relapse rates

A total of 115 patients (36.6%) ended 24 weeks of initial 150
mg or 300 mg therapy with adequate symptom control and were
observed over the 8-week withdrawal period for potential relapse
of symptoms (Figure 1). By dose level, 64.7% of patients initially
treated with 300 mg completed initial therapy with symptom
control compared with only 15.1% of patients treated with 150
mg. Mean UAS7 values over the initial treatment period for all
patients are presented in Figure E2 in this article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org. After withdrawal of omalizumab therapy, 12 of 27 patients (44.4%) in the 150 mg group
and 44 of 88 patients (50.0%) in the 300 mg group relapsed
within 8 weeks, defined as UAS7 greater than or equal to 16. In
patients who relapsed, mean UAS7 values returned to initial
baseline levels 8 weeks after withdrawal of omalizumab treatment

 

(Figure 2). In patients who did not meet the definition of relapse
within 8 weeks, mean UAS7 values also increased during the
withdrawal period but reflected a slower rate of symptom return
than in patients who met criteria for re-treatment within this
study (see Figure E3 in this article’s Online Repository at www.
jaci-inpractice.org). Across all patients who entered the treatment
withdrawal phase and relapsed, the average time to relapse was
4.7 weeks (95% CI, 4.1-5.3) and was similar within each dose
group (Table II).

Step-up treatment results

In total, 141 of 178 patients (79.2%) stepped up from 150
mg to 300 mg during the initial dosing period (Figure 1) as a
result of inadequate symptom control (UAS7 > 6) after at least 8
weeks of treatment. Most (81.5%, n = 115) of these patients
had this upward dosage adjustment after only 2 doses (8 weeks)
of omalizumab 150 mg. Increasing from 150 mg to 300 mg
resulted in an average 9.5-point (95% CI, 7.6-11.3) drop in
UAS7 over the average decline achieved with 150 mg treatment
initially. On completion of the step-up therapy (3 doses), 59
(45.4%; 95% CI, 37.1%-54.0%) patients achieved symptom
control (UAS7 < 6) and 33 (25.4%; 95% CI, 18.7%-33.5%)
had a complete response (UAS7 = 0) of the 130 patients who
had UAS7 values evaluable (Figure 3).

 

 

Extension period

Treatment extension did not result in an overall mean change
in UAS7 indicative of well-controlled disease. The mean change
in UAS7 between the end of the initial treatment phase and the
end of the second dosing period in patients who had an additional 12 weeks of extended treatment was —2.0 (95% CI, —5.3
to 1.4; N = 41). In all, 22.0% of patients were well controlled
(UAS7 < 6) at the end of the extension phase, with 12.2%
achieving UAS7 = 0, and 78.0% had UAS7 more than 6,
implying that their disease was not well controlled. However, the
higher proportion of patients in the extension phase who had
mild or moderate disease than at the start of treatment extension
suggest that there was an overall improvement in the disease
severity of patients. In patients who were in the extension phase,
the mean Dermatology Life Quality Index score decreased
by —8.4 (SD, 7.42) between baseline and the end of the

 

 
J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT
VOLUME 8, NUMBER 7

extension phase, which corresponded to a 55% decrease from
baseline. Given that nearly 1 in 4 patients did show clinical
benefit due to treatment extension, specific patient subgroups
may benefit from treatment extension, and further analyses are
needed to determine whether there are specific markers to predict
who may benefit from extended treatment.

Safety

Omalizumab was generally well tolerated, and there were no
new safety findings compared with previous clinical trials.
Overall, 13.1% of patients (41 of 314) experienced at least 1
treatment-related adverse event (AE). The most common
treatment-related AEs were headache (3.8%), nasopharyngitis
(2.9%), nausea (1.9%), and fatigue (1.9%) (see Tables El and
E2 in this article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org).
No patients died and 8 patients experienced serious AEs, but
none were considered related to treatment according to the investigator’s judgment. A total of 13 patients discontinued omalizumab treatment as a result of an AE. Of these, 8 patients were
discontinued from the study after commencing treatment with
the study drug; 1 patient was discontinued because of serious
AEs (pelvis fracture and bilateral pulmonary embolism), and 1
because of severe CSU flare resulting in the use of prohibited
medication. Four patients were discontinued before receiving a
specific treatment sequence, but after receiving at least 1 dose of
the study drug. Of these, 1 was discontinued because of nasal
congestion, 1 because of facial paralysis (Bell’s palsy), and 2
because of angioedema. Two additional patients became pregnant during the course of the study, 1 of them because of a
failure of contraception. Across all patients who received at least
1 dose of omalizumab (n = 314), there were no hypersensitivity
AEs or anaphylactic reactions, except 1 patient who reported an
allergic reaction to hair dye.

 

 

DISCUSSION

This phase 3b, randomized, multinational OPTIMA study
was designed to address important questions on the optimal use
of omalizumab therapy in patients with CSU in the context of
treatment withdrawal, relapse, and re-treatment as well as provide data on potential treatment strategies when symptoms are
not controlled. Overall, these results will help health care providers to set appropriate expectations of relapse and re-treatment
response with their patients. These data will also help inform
decisions about initial dosing and management of further omalizumab treatment under circumstances of both adequate
symptom control and inadequate symptom control observed in
the initial course of therapy.

Main findings

The primary end point of the study addressed the question of
what happens when patients who experience a relapse of symptoms after treatment withdrawal are re-treated with another
course of omalizumab therapy. The results of this study showed
that most patients who underwent re-treatment after relapse were
able to regain symptom control with a second course of treatment, and re-treatment was effective at both 150 mg and 300 mg
dose levels. It is important to note that very few patients treated
with 150 mg in this study were able to achieve sustained
symptom control at this initial dose; nonetheless, in primary
responders there appeared to be no dampening of the response
upon a second course of omalizumab. The profile of UAS7 and

SUSSMAN ETAL 2377

time to achieve symptom control in relapsed patients was similar
between re-treatment and the initial dosing periods, indicating
that the clinical efficacy of omalizumab is similar after repeated
exposure. Regardless of the dose group, 2 distinct patterns were
observed in the onset of relapse during the withdrawal phase
among patients who were well controlled on initial omalizumab
therapy. Patients either had onset of relapse rapidly within 8
weeks of discontinuing therapy, or they gradually reached the
study-defined Urticaria Activity Score threshold after 8 weeks.
The current results have shown that in patients who were a part
of the OPTIMA study, stopping omalizumab therapy once
symptoms were under control was followed in several cases by a
relapse of symptoms, however; patients were likely to experience
a successful outcome in the event of relapse and re-treatment.
This study was designed to only follow those patients who
withdrew from therapy over 8 weeks; thus, the timing of
symptom relapse and re-treatment outcomes beyond 8 weeks
remain unknown.

 

Comparison with existing literature

A key secondary outcome of this study was designed to answer
questions about an appropriate course of action for patients who
do not respond to an initial dose of 150 mg. Based on 3 previous
phase 3 trials, both the 150 mg and 300 mg doses of omalizumab
effectively improved symptoms of urticaria but there was a clear
dose-response relationship, with the best outcomes consistently
reported with the 300 mg dose.” ’ This OPTIMA study provides
additional evidence of this dose-response relationship, because
most of the patients who were initially treated with 150 mg
omalizumab required step-up therapy to 300 mg to achieve
symptom control. A similarly high frequency of step-up therapy
was also observed in a previous small pilot study, in which
individualized trials of omalizumab therapy were performed in
27 patients with CSU starting with a 150 mg dose and 2-week
dosing intervals, and 44% of these patients required a dose increase to 300 mg within 3 weeks (2 doses) because of inadequate
symptom control.'* In our study, most patients initially treated
with 150 mg also met criteria for stepping up to 300 mg after
only 2 doses (8 weeks). In a pooled analysis across all the phase 3
omalizumab trials,” the proportion of patients who met
response criteria (for either well-controlled symptoms [UAS7 <
6] or symptom-free status [UAS7 = 0]) in the 150 mg treatment
groups generally plateaued after the first 2 doses, whereas the
proportion of responders in the 300 mg treatment groups
continued to increase slightly until the end of the 12-week or 24week treatment periods, as applicable to the study. ' An overview
of current literature focusing on the use of omalizumab in CSU
remarks that 300 mg is the ideal dose to initiate omalizumab. In
this review of both clinical trials, and real-world data, the authors
state that in patients who show relapse after omalizumab
discontinuation, re-treatment with the 300 mg dose is accompanied by high rates of clinical improvement. '° Furthermore,
this review reflects on updosing of omalizumab to doses higher
than 300 mg (450 mg or 600 mg)—literature suggests that both
doses improve UAS7 more than 6 rates in partial responders on
300 mg with no considerable safety concerns. ‘O18 Therefore, on
the basis of these results, when patients are prescribed an initial
dose of 150 mg, 8 weeks may be an appropriate time to
reevaluate the patient’s symptoms and consider whether additional management is required. Almost half (45%) the patients in
our study who stepped up in dose ultimately achieved symptom

ntrol, which provides evidence that increasing the dose can be

effective in patients who do not respond to 150 mg. Thus, the
totality of evidence suggests that initiating omalizumab treatment
with a 300 mg dose may provide the best opportunity for the
most rapid and successful outcomes.

CONCLUSIONS

The results of this study demonstrate that control of CSU

symptoms with omalizumab can be recaptured after a withdrawal

and

col

re-treatment of therapy. Furthermore, physicians who
nsider stopping omalizumab therapy when patients have

adequate symptom control should be aware that relapse of
symptoms could occur rapidly (median time to relapse was 4.7
weeks) and frequently (49% of patients within 8 weeks). Another
important aspect to this study was evaluation of a step-up strategy

in

patients initiated on the 150 mg dose after a minimum of 8

weeks, which was required in most patients. Although increasing
the omalizumab dose to 300 mg from 150 mg improved symptom control in 45% of patients, this step-up approach may not
provide the most rapid benefits to patients, but may be more costeffective due to the optimal use of medication. These data provide
further guidance on the optimal use of omalizumab in patients
with CSU and will help inform prescribers’ decision making
regarding initial dosing, treatment withdrawal, and re-treatment.
