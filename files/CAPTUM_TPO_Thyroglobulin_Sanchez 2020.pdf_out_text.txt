Highlights

- insilico analysis allowed to identify antigen patches of human proteins TPO,
Tg and IL24.

- These antigen patches could explain the autoreactive response in chronic
urticaria and hypothyroidism.

- There was no cross reactivity between the identified antigen patches and

the tested environmental allergens.

ABSTRACT
Background: Human proteins such as interleukin-24 (IL24), thyroperoxidase
(TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg) are targets of IgE or IgG autoantibodies. Why these
proteins are recognized by autoantibodies in some patients with chronic

spontaneous urticaria (CSU) or hypothyroidism is unknown.

Objective: Through in silico analysis, identify antigen patches of TPO, Tg and IL24
and compare the sequences of these human proteins with some prevalent

allergens.

Methods: The amino acids sequences of IL24, thyroperoxidase and thyroglobulin
were compared between them and with 22 environmental allergens. Phylogenetic
studies and multiple pairing were carried out to explore the degree of protein
identity and cover. The proteins without 3D structure reported in the database,
were modeled by homology with “Swiss Modeller’ and compared through PYMOL.
Residues conserved and accessible to the solvent (rASA> 0.25) were located in

the 3D model to identify possible areas of cross-reactivity and antigen binding.

Results: We build a 3D model of the TPO and thyroglobulin protein base on
proteins closely related. Five epitopes for TPO, six for IL24 and six for thyroglobulin
were predicted. The amino acid sequences of allergens from different sources
(Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Blomia tropicalis, Betula verrucosa, Cynodon
dactylon, Aspergillus fumigatus, Canis domesticus, Felis domesticus) were
compared with human TPO, Tg and IL24. The cover and alignments between

allergens and human proteins were low.
Conclusion: We identify possible linear and conformational epitopes of TPO, Tg
and IL24 that could be the target of IgE or IgG binding in patients with urticaria or
hypothyroidism; These epitopes do not appear to be present among common
environmental allergens, suggesting that autoreactivity to these human proteins

are not by cross-reactivity.

Keywords: Autoantibodies; Thyroperoxidase; Interleukin-24; Thyroglobulin;

Urticaria; Hypothyroidism.

1. INTRODUCTION

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a disease characterized by the presence of
hives and angioedema that significantly affects the quality of life (1, 2). Patients
with urticaria have a higher frequency of self-reactive autoantibodies IgE and IgG
than healthy subjects (3-7). Thyroperoxidase (TPO), interleukin 24 (IL24) and
thyroglobulin (Tg) are some of the proteins that have been implicated in the
pathogenesis of urticaria (8-10). The frequency of autoantibodies against these
proteins is low in healthy subjects (8, 11) but Anti-Tg and anti-TPO antibodies are
common in patients with thyroid carcinoma or Hashimoto's thyroiditis (12-14). Why
these human proteins are recognized by specific autoantibodies in patients with

urticaria or hypothyroidism is unknown.
Similar to what has been observed in other diseases (15-19), it is possible that in
CSU and hypothyroidism the recognition of human proteins by IgG or IgE

autoantibodies can be by cross-reactivity with environmental allergens.

This hypothesis is supported by some observations:

1) Patients with urticaria have a higher frequency of atopy and some allergic
diseases like asthma and rhinitis than the population without CSU (20, 21).

2) Patients with urticaria have a higher frequency of hypothyroidism than the
population without urticaria (22-24).

3) A higher frequency of anti-TPO IgE is present in patients with CSU and
hypothyroidism and the response against this human antigen can induce
histamine release by basophils (10, 22).

4) In some skin diseases like atopic dermatitis, IgE cross-reactivity have been
detected between human antigens and proteins from pollen grains or fungus
(25, 26).

5) In some autoimmune diseases like thyroid disease, molecular mimicry has
been detected between human antigens and some proteins from

microorganisms (27-29)

The identification of the antigenic epitopes of IL24, TPO and Tg and the search of
antigenic patches with cross-reactivity between these human proteins and common

environmental allergens, could help to evaluate this hypothesis.

2. METHODS

2.1 Selection of proteins and alignment
The amino acids sequences of TPO, IL24 and Tg were compared with prevalent
allergens (Table 1) (30-33). The sequences were obtained from the uniprot
database (https://www.uniprot.org/). Sequences that were reported in the

WHOA/IUIS Allergen Nomenclature Sub-Committee (http://Awww.allergen.org) and

 

presented a complete sequence were used. All the allergens that fulfilled these
criteria were chosen, independent of the source (e.g pollen, animal) where it came
from. Due to the variety of origin and length of amino acids between the molecules
studied, cover and identity values were used to establish the degree of relationship
between them. Identity and cover values between the molecule used in this study
was determined by using BLAST from NCBI and praline web server
(http://www.ibi.vu.nl/). Parameters to perform alignment were set up to use
BLOSUMB62 as exchange matrix and a conditional compositional score matrix
adjustments. Not filter or Marking were used. Iterations used were 3 with an Evalue of 0.01. Based in previous observations (34-36), we considered proper

homology when both the identity and cover value were greater than 40%.

2.2 Phylogenetic analysis

The program “Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis” (MEGA) version X was
used for the construction of the tree, using the method of reconstruction of
Neighbor-Joining with support by Bootstrap with 1000 replications as a measure of
reliability and robustness and a p — distance model, under the assumption of
minimal or non-evolution in the topology (37, 38). This model uses a comparative
matrix to find the similarity between the sequences. The matrix was constructed

with all amino acid sequences of allergens chosen that were available in human
proteins retrieved from Uniprot database and reported in WHO/IUIS Allergen

 

Nomenclature Sub-Committee (http://www.allergen.org). Thus, the more positive
identity values are found among the sequences, and they will be located in closer
positions in the tree. All empty spaces were eliminated (full deletions). From the
global comparison and the homologies, the sum of the length of branches (SBL)
will be presented, which will determine the number of nodes and the position of the
same, including the “clusters” of the evolutionarily closest sequences. The
alignment for the phylogenetic analysis was carried out through the CLUSTAL W.

program, which performs alignments.

2.3 Construction of 3D models and epitope prediction

The models of those proteins not reported in the protein data bank, were made by

homology. The Swiss-model server (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/) was used

 

(39). The quality of the models was analyzed by ProSA-web. The models were
refined in Deep-View (energy minimization and rotamer replacements). Its quality
was evaluated by several tools, including the Ramachandran graphs, WHATIF,
QMEAN4 index and energy values (GROMOS96 force field). The relative values of
the area of accessible solvent (r-ASA) were determined by ASA-view. The models
were used to identify residues exposed on the surface and conserved in the
different groups. Those preserved and the residues accessible to the solvent (rASA
> 0.25) were located in the 3D model to identify pooled areas (>4 residues) and

possible cross-reactivity. Ellipro (http://tools.iedb.org/ellipro/) tools were used to

 

predict lineal and discontinues epitopes on TPO, IL24 and thyroglobulin. Residues
with larger scores are associated with greater solvent accessibility. Only residues

with a score >0,75 were selected.

3. RESULTS

3.1 Sequences alignments

A total of 27 sequences including human TPO, Tg, two isoforms of IL24 (X1 and
X5, due the different in length) and 22 prevalent allergens from seven different
sources, were selected based on allergenic capacity reported (Table 1). The
percentages of identity between the allergens Vs. TPO, IL24 and Tg are shown in
Table 2. The cover between allergens and TPO was quite low, with a maximum
cover and identity with Can f 3 (37% and 28.1% respectively). Most of the

sequence’s alignments had a coverage less than 5%.

The IL24 isoform X5 and Can f 1 show the highest match among the alignments
(cover of 52% and an identity of 30.77%). For the case of the isoform X1, Asp f 5
showed the greatest identity among the allergens (cover 31.2%, identity 23%)

followed by Blo t 2 (cover 17%, Identity 29%) (Table 2).

The thyroglobulin was the human antigen who show the lowest match with the
allergens. Maximum cover of thyroglobulin was obtained with Can f 2 (8%), but the

identity was 26.9%.

3.2 Phylogenetic analysis

The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method and
involved a total of 27 amino acid sequences and is shows in the figure 1. The

bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1000 replicates is taken to represent the
representation of the sequence similarity degree between the proteins analyzed.
The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in
the bootstrap test are shown next to the branches and all ambiguous positions
were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion option). There were a total
of 2767 positions in the final dataset. The different molecules studied showed a
very low relationship between them due to the protein diversity studied. In the
analysis of the Neighbor-Joining method, the different molecules studied showed a
very low relationship between them due to the protein diversity studied.
Thyroglobulin and IL24 isoforms were grouped in a single clade while the TPO
showed a slight relationship between Fel d 3 and Can f 5 and in the next branch
Cyn d 1 and Asp f 1. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than
50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The evolutionary distances were computed
using the p-distance method and are in the units of the number of amino acid

differences per site.
3.3 Linear and discontinuous epitopes were predicted on TPO, IL24 and Tg

We build a 3D model of the TPO and Tg protein using proteins closely related;
Three closet homologue protein of TPO were found: Lactoperoxidase (48%),
myeloperoxidase (47%), and eosinophil peroxidase (47%). Here, we used the
myeloperoxidase as the structure modelling due its dimers forms. By using Ellipro
server, three lineal and two discontinuous epitopes on TPO were predicted (Table
3a). The first lineal epitope was located on a loops regions and the second and
third lineal epitopes were located on a-helices (L1: 295 — 314; L2: 418 — 433; L3

711 — 735), all with an area surface greater than 300 A. None of these sequences
were conserved in the allergens studied (Figure 2a). Discontinuous epitopes 1 and
2 are conformed by 31 and 55 amino acid residues, respectively, located between

two a-helices (Figure 2b).

The IL 24 structure was previously described and analyzed by X-Ray methods and
reported in Uniprot by the code 6DF3 (40), three lineal and three discontinuous
epitopes were predicted and all the linear patches are found in B-sheets (LE1: 42 —
54; LE2: 218 — 229; LE3: 145 — 153) (Table 3b; Figure 3a). The first discontinuous
epitope is located in a loop, between two antiparallel B sheets, with a total of 6
residues. The other two patches are close located, DE2 is among to B-sheets and
a loops with a total of 8 residues, meanwhile DE 3 cover more area and has part of

3 antiparallel B-sheets with a total of 27 residues (Figure 3b).

The model construction of the monomer Tg used the acetylcholinesterase as the
template due it presented the greatest identity with a 36%. Four linear epitopes and
two discontinuous epitopes were found in the thyroglobulin (Table 3c). Three of the
linear epitopes are found in different alpha helices while only one is part of Bsheets structure (LE1: 2719 — 2731; LE2: 2522 — 2545; LE3: 2197 — 2228; LE4:
2547 — 2579) (Figure 4). The first two discontinuous epitopes were excluded since
they did not meet the conditions because one of them had only three residues and

the other present a score <0.75.

4. DISCUSSION

10
CSU is a disease with multiple triggers and mechanisms (3, 4, 41, 42). Different
autoimmune mechanisms have been identified, being the IgG and IgE

autoantibodies the most studied mechanisms (5, 43-46).

It has been possible to detect autoantibodies against multiple human antigens in
CSU (8-10, 15, 47), the most studied is the thyroperoxidase. In one recent study
we demonstrated that thyroperoxidase could induce hives in patients with urticaria
and anti-TPO IgE (10); It has also been observed that the suppression of anti- TPO
IgE avoid hives (10, 48). The demonstration of this causal relationship, opened the
possibility that other autoantibodies can do the same in this disease. Nevertheless,
it is not Known why this auto-reactive response occurs. Some hypotheses could

explain this self-response;

1) Patients with CSU have an increased risk of developing autoimmune
diseases possibly due to genes isoforms influencing the immune response,
which would facilitate the recognition of autoantigens by clones of B
lymphocytes with IgE or lgG receptors. This hypothesis is supported by
epidemiological investigations that show a higher frequency of hypothyroidism in
patients with CSU (15 to 30%) compared to subjects without CSU (5 to 7%). The
high frequency of hypothyroidism is present in patients with CSU and anti-TPO IgE
or anti-FceRla IgG. Mozena, et al., (49) investigated whether the high incidence of
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT), observed in patients with CSU could be explained by
epitope cross-reactivity of anti-FceRla antibodies with thyroid proteins (TPO and
Tg); they did not find that thyroid proteins could generate an inhibition of the

response observed with anti-FceRla IgG, so they concluded that cross-reactivity

11
does not explain the increased prevalence of HT found in CSU patients with antiFceRla IgG. Nevertheless, they didn't compare the IgE response or the identity of
the epitopes among thyroid proteins. The results of Mozena, et al, also indicate
that IgG against TPO and Tg had no capacity to induce mast cell activation,
however, other studies have shown that recognition of these antigens by IgE can
lead to cell activation (9, 10). All these results suggest that the autoimmune
response IgE and IgG in urticaria may have some points in common, but also
differences in the recognized antigens. If there is a common epitope for the IgG
response in HT and for the IgE response in CSU is unknown but, we identify some
antigenic epitopes that could be recognized by both antibodies (IgG and IgE), and
we believe that during an inflammatory process secondary to the recognition of
self-proteins as occurs in these diseases, the formation of multiple B lymphocytes
cell clones IgG and IgE is enhanced and this could explain the epidemiological

relationship that has been found in both diseases.

We identify some possible antigenic epitopes for both TPO and Tg; These epitopes
did not share a common sequence, so they are unlikely to have cross-reactivity
and possibly its formation is by independent mechanisms. As presented in Table 2,
the identity and cover of these proteins and the IL24 was also low. No epitopes
shared between IL24 and thyroid antigens were found, so cross reactivity is
unlikely. There is still little information about the role of IL24 in hives; In one study,
IgE-anti-IL24 was found in a large number of patients with CSU (90%), but the

possible association with other autoimmune diseases has not been evaluated.

12
2) Human thyroperoxidase could share antigenic epitopes with prevalent

allergens (e.g., house dust mites, pets, fungal spores or pollen).

Epidemiological studies that show a higher prevalence of atopy in patients with
CSU versus subjects without urticaria support this hypothesis (50-52). It is also
supported in some studies with IgE skin diseases; In atopic dermatitis, human
auto-antigens that have cross-reactivity with similar environmental allergens have
been detected in patients with severe clinical conditions (25, 26). According with
this hypothesis, first, the body would mount an IgE response to common allergenic
sources such as mite proteins, dog epithelia, grains of pollen etc., subsequently,
after a chronic inflammatory process these antibodies would recognize similar
epitopes in humans previously unexposed and, through cross-reactivity, they would

mount an autoreactive response.

To explore this hypothesis, we compared the sequence of TPO, Tg and IL24 with
multiple allergenic proteins. Proteins with a close phylogenetic relationship are
more likely to share common segments in their sequence, however the
phylogenetic relationship between the proteins studied was low. Through in-silico
prediction analysis, we describe several epitopes in TPO, Tg and IL24 with
antigenic potential that could be the targets for antibodies, however none of these
epitopes seems to be present in the primary or tertiary structure of the allergens
studied. Therefore, according to these results, cross-reactivity between exogenous
allergens and endogenous antigens seems unlikely. The high prevalence of atopy
in patients with CSU could then be due to other causes; for example, the polyclonal

response that can be generated after a chronic inflammatory response may

13
boosting IgE response to different unrelated antigens. However, we cannot rule out
that other allergenic proteins not included in this study could share cross-reactivity
with TPO, Tg, IL24; for example, Helicobacter pylori or Toxocara canis have
proteins capable of binding to IgE and IgG autoantibodies, and have been
associated as possible triggers of chronic urticaria (53, 54). However, we were
unable to explore this possibility since their proteins have not yet been reported in
NCBI or Uniprot. In addition, we chose multiple frequent allergens but it is possible
that other less prevalent allergens from mites, pets or fungi could have a greater

identity with TPO, Tg or IL24.

It is also necessary to note that our study has some weaknesses that could explain
the lack of cross-reactivity between the auto-antigens and the allergens evaluated;
In the case of TPO, we model its tertiary structure based on other homologous
proteins since its tertiary structure is unknown, however in-silico constructions are
not exact and it is possible that its natural form is different from what we propose.
In the same direction, the antigen patches require further confirmation through
studies in biological models. However, bioinformatic analyzes have many
advantages to prioritize the resources of an investigation and serve in the initial
evaluation of a hypothesis and as support in defining whether or not it is justified to

perform in-vitro or ex-vivo analysis.

In conclusion, through in-silico modeling we identify possible linear and
conformational epitopes of TPO, Tg and IL24 that could be the target of IgE or IgG
binding in patients with urticaria or hypothyroidism; These epitopes do not appear

to be present among the major allergens from mites, common grass, dog, cat and

14
Aspergillus fumigatus, suggesting that they are by a specific reaction and not by

cross-reactivity.

Table 3. Lineal and discontinuous epitopes from TPO (3a), IL24 (3b), Tg (3c). A total of 5 antigenic patches was predicted

for TPO (table 3a), six for IL24 (table 3b) and six for Tg (table 3c). They contained more than three amino acids and a
score >0.75 excluding the second discontinuous patch from TPO and discontinuous patches from Tg but given the low

number of epitopes it was included.
