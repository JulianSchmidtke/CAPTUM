KEYWORDS Abstract

Adolescents; Background: Omalizumab is useful as an add-on treatment in patients unresponsive to high
Chronic urticaria; doses of second-generation antihistamines. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety
Efficacy; of omalizumab treatment in adolescents with refractory chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU).
Omalizumab; Methods: CSU patients aged 12-18 years old with the diagnosis of symptomatic CSU and
Safety unresponsive to classical treatment were included in the study. All patients had an urticaria
activity-score (UAS7) of >16 or and were treated with 300mg omalizumab every four weeks.
The degree of response was classified into complete, partial and non-responders due to UAS7.
Results: A total of 29 patients were evaluated. The median age and symptom onset age of
the patients was 15.2 (IQR, 12.8-16.5) years and 14.0 (IQR, 11.8-15.9) years, respectively. The
median duration of urticaria was eight (IQR, 4-24) months at admission. Eleven (37.9%) patients
had angioedema and ten (34.5%) patients had concomitant allergic diseases. The median age
at the beginning of treatment with omalizumab was 15.4 (IQR, 12.9-16.9) years. The median
symptom duration was 12 (IQR, 6.5-27.5) months before the omalizumab treatment. Twentyeight (96.5%) of the patients (89.6% complete, 6.9% partial) achieved response; however, one
patient was a non-responder (3.5%). The adverse effect was observed in one (3.4%) patient as
angioedema after the third dose. Twenty-three patients were followed up for a median of 18
(IQR, 13-27) months. Relapse was observed in three (13%) patients.

Conclusions: Omalizumab is considered as an effective and safe treatment for CSU in adolescents. Relapses mostly occur within the first year after the cessation of treatment.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a disease characterized by itchy hives and/or angioedema that occur daily
or almost daily for at least six weeks without any external
stimulus.’ Inducible urticaria and urticarial vasculitis form
the other types of chronic urticaria (CU).? Chronic urticaria
in children may affect up to 3% of the pediatric population.
According to current guidelines, the treatment for chronic
urticaria involves H1 antihistamines as the first-line, which
can be increased up to fourfold the licensed dosage. However, one-third of adults and more than 10% of children
do not respond to high dose H1 antihistamines and require
third-line treatment such as omalizumab, cyclosporine, and
montelukast.*° Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized
monoclonal anti-IgE antibody that binds to free IgE and
indirectly downregulates FceRI receptor expression on mast
cells and basophils.° Omalizumab was approved by the FDA
in March 2014 for CSU in adults and adolescents 12 years
of age and older in cases of antihistamine refractoriness.”
A multicenter study from Italy included 322 patients with
refractory CSU aged 15-83 years showed that omalizumab
is a well-tolerated and effective therapy for this wide age
range population.®

Even though the current literature on the treatment
of CSU with omalizumab is rapidly increasing, information
about the efficacy and safety of omalizumab treatment in
children with CSU is limited. Large pivotal phase III trials
have demonstrated a good safety and efficacy profile.-"'
A recent systematic literature review of omalizumab treatment of children with CSU less than 12 years of age suggested
that omalizumab could be a safe treatment option in this
age group.'* There is also a published information gap on
the use of omalizumab in the subgroup of patients from 12
to younger than 18 years old with CSU. A study that analyzed
a total of 39 adolescents with CSU in three phase III studies reported potential differences in baseline demographic
and clinical characteristics between adult and adolescent
patients.'? Considering these limited data in children, this
study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of
omalizumab in adolescents with recalcitrant chronic spontaneous urticaria.

Methods

This study was conducted at Hacettepe University School of
Medicine, Department of Pediatric Allergy, between January
2015 and August 2018 and was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Hacettepe University. Informed written consent was obtained from all patients and parents.

Chronic urticaria was the presence of recurrent urticaria,
angioedema, or both, for six weeks or longer. Patients
without a clinical response who were treated with secondgeneration antihistamines at a four-fold increased dose were
defined as refractory CSU.'* Twenty-nine refractory CSU
patients from 12 to 18 years old with a diagnosis of symptomatic CSU were included in the study population. The
study had both retrospective and prospective aspects. First,
the medical reports of CSU patients were evaluated retrospectively. Then the clinical status of each patient was
evaluated firstly by a telephone visit and then by hospital

visits. Urticaria activity score of 7 (UAS7) was used to evaluate disease activity. Itching severity and urticarial plaque
number were graded and the sum of seven days of UAS gave
the UAS7.' All the patients had an UAS7 of 16 or greater.
Patients were treated with 300mg omalizumab subcutaneously once every four weeks. The treatment continued
until the patient had no symptoms for three months. If this
time was less than six months, the total duration of the
treatment was completed to six months. The patients were
evaluated at each visit for the effectiveness of the therapy.

The degree of response was classified into complete
responders (UAS7=0), partial responders (UAS7 <6 but not
0) and non-responders (UAS7 > 6).'° Relapse was considered
to be the reappearance of CSU symptoms after the end of
the omalizumab treatment.

We also evaluated demographic and clinical features of
patients, including gender, age at onset, frequency and
duration of symptoms, presence of angioedema, concomitant symptoms other than urticaria or angioedema, personal
and familial history of allergic diseases, chronic diseases and
laboratory findings. Triggering factors that increase symptoms such as cold, heat, sunlight, exercise, stress, infection,
food additives, menstrual cycle, and drugs were questioned.
Medications (H; receptor antagonists, H, receptor antagonists, oral corticosteroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists
(LTRA), immunosuppressants) administered before omalizumab treatment, treatments administered concurrently
with omalizumab and side effects during omalizumab treatment were recorded.

Complete blood cell count, eosinophil percentage, total
immunoglobulin E (IgE), specific IgE levels, C-reactive protein level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C3 and C4 levels,
thyroid hormones, thyroid autoantibodies, antinuclear antibody, anti-double-stranded DNA antibody, urine analysis and
stool examination for parasites were reviewed from the
database.'®'? The normal limits of the laboratory results
were evaluated as follows: thyroid-stimulating hormone:
0.38-5.33 pIU/mL; thyroxine: 7.86-14.41 pmol/L; sedimentation rate: 0-20mm/h; C-reactive protein: 0-0.8 mg/dl;
C3: 79-152 mg/dl; C4: 16-38 mg/dl.

The data were analyzed with SPSS statistical software,
version 20.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). The proportions
in different groups were compared by using the Pearson x
test or the Fisher exact test. All numeric variables were nonnormally distributed and compared with Mann-Whitney U
or Kruskal-Wallis tests, when appropriate; the results were
given as median and interquartile ranges (IQR). A p-value of
0.05 indicated a statistically significant result. '®

Results

A total of 29 patients who met the study criteria were evaluated. The patients were predominantly females (n= 16;
55%). The median age and symptom onset age of the
patients were 15.2 years (IQR, 12.8-16.5 years) and 14.0
years (IQR, 11.8-15.9 years), respectively. The median duration of urticaria before omalizumab treatment was eight
months (IQR, 4-24 months). Eleven (37.9%) patients had
angioedema and 10 (34.5%) patients had concomitant allergic diseases. A family history of allergic diseases was present
in seven (24.1%) patients. The characteristics of the patients

are summarized in Table 1. Triggering factors that increased
the symptoms of patients are given in Fig. 1.

High antinuclear antibody titers (>1/160) were found
in 15/26 (57.6%) patients but none of them were diagnosed as having the rheumatologic disease during the study
period. Skin prick tests (SPT) and autolog serum skin testing were performed on only 10 patients due to the use
of antihistamines. Autolog serum skin testing was positive in 2/10 (20%) patients and SPT was positive in 5/10
(50%) patients. The leukocyte and eosinophil counts, C3 and
C4 levels were within normal limits. All the patients had
normal thyroid function tests and negative thyroid autoantibody results. Stool parasite examination was positive in
2/17 (11.7%) patients and Blastocystis hominis eggs were
detected (Table 2).

Medications used before the start of omalizumab
treatment were H1 antihistamines (100%), H2 receptor
antagonists (34.5%), montelukast (37.9%) and oral corticosteroids (17.2%) (Table 3).

The median age of onset of omalizumab was 15.4 years
(IQR 12.9-16.9 years). The median symptom duration was 12
months (IQR 6.5-27.5 months) before the omalizumab treatment. A total of 28 (96.5%) [26 (89.6%) complete, two (6.9%)
partial] patients achieved remission with omalizumab. The
number of patients who had more than a 30% decline in
UAS7 within 12 weeks of treatment is indicated in Fig. 2
according to the weeks. At week 12, after three doses of
omalizumab, complete response was reported in 17 (58%)
patients (Fig. 3). The median time to achieve a complete
response was 7.5 (IQR 3-14.7) weeks. One (3.5%) patient
showed no significant change in UAS7 at week 12 so omalizumab was discontinued and the case was accepted as a
non-responder. The omalizumab dose interval was extended
to six weeks in eight (27.5%) patients.

The adverse effect was observed in only one (3.4%)
patient as angioedema after the third dose of omalizumab
and asymptomatic two months. Allergy skin tests were performed with omalizumab solution and an intradermal skin
test at a dilution of 1:10 was detected positive with a wheal
of 10mm. There was no effect of pre-treatment symptom
duration (p= 0.167) and associated angioedema on symptom
disappearance time (p=0.41). Twenty-three of 26 patients
who had a complete response and completed the treatment
were followed-up for a median of 18 months (IQR, 13-27
months). Relapse was observed in three (13%) patients. The
relapse times of three patients were 4, 6, and 12 months
after the end of omalizumab therapy.

Discussion

The omalizumab treatment in adolescents with CSU seems
to be highly effective. Nearly 90% of our patients showed
a complete response rate and another 6.5% showed a partial response. We experienced only one adverse effect as
angioedema, which did not preclude the continuation of
the therapy. Within a one-and-a-half-year follow-up period
after cessation of omalizumab treatment, 13% of the children with CSU relapsed. Relapses occurred within the first
year after cessation of treatment. Omalizumab is considered
as an effective and safe treatment for CSU in adolescents.
There are few studies in the literature on the use of
omalizumab in children with CSU. Most studies of omalizumab in adult patients guide this treatment option in
adolescents and children. Three randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled clinical trials, ASTERIA |,'° ASTERIA II?
and GLACIAL,'' demonstrated the efficacy and safety of
omalizumab in adults. In these three pivotal studies, ASTERIA | and ASTERIA Il included patients who remained
symptomatic with H1-antihistamines at approved doses but
GLACIAL enrolled patients who were symptomatic despite
the suggested combination therapies (up to four-fold dose
of H1-antihistamines, plus H2 antihistamines, LTRAs or both
H2-antihistamines and LTRAs). Although the methodologies
of the studies were different, the similarities in efficacy
were emphasized.*-'' In our study, the inclusion criteria
were similar to GLACIAL and the number of previous CSU
medications was a median of two (IQR, 1-3). Because the
adolescents were not the focus of these study populations,
they had not been evaluated separately for the efficacy of
omalizumab. In a clinical review that had 975 patients with

Figure 2 Response time of patients according to UAS7 scores.

CSU, 39 (4%) were from 12 to under 18 years old. That statistical study had the highest number of adolescent cases in
the literature. The mean age of the adolescent group was
15.1 years and most patients were female (69.2%).'? Similarly, the mean age of the group in our study was 15.2 years
and most patients were female (56.2%).

A systematic review of 84 observational studies reported
the effectiveness of different dosing regimens, such as
150 mg/dose every two weeks or every four weeks (Q4W),
but most frequently, omalizumab was commenced at
300mg/dose (62.7%) at a frequency of Q4W (83.9%).'?
Another study that described response patterns using the
data of three pivotal omalizumab trials demonstrated that
300 mg of omalizumab could control CSU symptoms well. '
In our study, we initiated with 300 mg/dose Q4W. The omalizumab dose interval was prolonged to six weeks in eight
(27.5%) patients since they showed lower UAS7 scores and
good responses. It should be noted that individualizing the
dose and frequency may increase treatment success.

The number of patients who had more than a 30% decline in UAS7
within 12 weeks of treatment.

UAS7 provides semi-quantitative information on disease
activity between clinical visits.2° There are variations among
studies on the definition of response to treatment in CSU.
In most of the studies, the degree of response was classified into complete responders (UAS7 =0), partial responders
(UAS7 <6 but not 0) and non-responders (UAS>6).2' In our
study, we also evaluated our patients according to previous definitions. In ASTERIA Il the median time to achieve
complete response was eight weeks for the patients who
received 300mg omalizumab. The median time for complete response was 12 and 13 weeks in the studies ASTERIA
| and GLACIAL for 300mg omalizumab, respectively. At
week 12, patients treated with 300 mg omalizumab reported
UAS7=0; 35.8% for ASTERIA |, 44.3% for ASTERIA II and
33.7% for GLACIAL.°-"' An earlier study by Sussman et al.

found a complete response rate of 79% for any point during the study.”? A recent retrospective study by Nettis et al.
reported a complete response of 67% 7° In the present study,
we found an overall response rate of 96.5%, with only one
patient not responding. By week 12, 96.5% of our patients
achieved a response (partial or complete), however, 31%
of patients gained complete response after the 12th week.
These findings were similar to previous adult studies. After
the initiation of omalizumab, the possibility of response at
different time points may be observed. The time to respond
to treatment may vary in adults and children.

In the literature, there is no marked consensus related to
the time of discontinuation of omalizumab treatment. Metz
et al.”4 reported that omalizumab treatment could be continued for 6-12 months. However, the general approach is
to specify the treatment period according to the patient’s
clinical response.”° Some patients may experience relapse
after cessation of omalizumab. It is important to know
when the medication can be stopped and whether the
patients have to be retreated in the event of recurrence
of symptoms. A study investigating patients who were at
risk of relapse after stopping omalizumab treatment suggested that the speed of symptom return was independent
of baseline characteristics of the patients, including duration of CSU, angioedema, previous treatments received, or
patient demographics. However, they considered that symptom return could be estimated based on baseline UAS7 and
early treatment response.” In a retrospective study that
included 31 patients with refractory CSU it was found that
the mean time to achieve complete therapy response was a
statistically significant difference between the time to complete response with the first and third course. It was faster
as the number of retreatments increased.””

A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled study that enrolled patients with antihistamineresistant CSU was designed to answer questions regarding
the benefit of omalizumab treatment after 24 and 48 weeks.
It was suggested that continuous treatment with omaljzumab was beneficial both for preventing the return of
symptoms as well as for achieving sustained control through
48 weeks of treatment.”° In the present study, we continued

treatment for at least six months. Only three of our patients
experienced a relapse at 4, 6, and 12 months after the end
of omalizumab therapy.

The safety of omalizumab has been evaluated in numerous adult studies. The most common adverse events
reported were headache (6.1%), sinusitis (4.9%), arthralgia
(2.9%) and injection-site reaction (2.7%).2? There were no
reports of omalizumab related anaphylaxis in three pivotal
studies, ASTERIA |, ASTERIA Il or GLACIAL.*° However, one
case was reported who experienced anaphylaxis 36h after
omalizumab administration.*' Angioedema and urticaria following omalizumab for CSU were stated in four cases.*? In
the present study, we observed angioedema in one (3.4%)
patient after the third dose of omalizumab.

Clinical and laboratory criteria have not been defined to
predict the effectiveness of omalizumab treatment. Positive determinants of omalizumab response, such as absence
of angioedema, advanced age, history of short-term disease, no history of immunosuppressant use and negative
result on a histamine release test were reported in a study
that had 154 CSU patients treated with omalizumab.*»
Angioedema has been reported to occur in 40% of patients
with CSU and 23.1% in omalizumab clinical trials involving
adolescents. '?34 Angioedema was detected in 37.7% of our
study population. No significant association was observed
between treatment response and demographics, concomitant diseases. In a multicenter study that assessed the
safety, efficacy, and predictors of poor treatment outcome
of omalizumab in patients with CSU, higher pretreatment
IgE levels were found less likely to be associated with poor
treatment response.*° In the present study, we did not find
any laboratory predictors for poor treatment outcome. However, prospective studies including children under 18 years
old would be informative in this setting.

In conclusion, our results indicate that treatment with
300mg/4QW of omalizumab for at least six months is
effective and safe for adolescents with CSU. Additional
double-blind and placebo-controlled randomized studies are
needed to assess the safety and efficacy of omalizumab in
this special population.
