What is already known about this topic? The urticaria activity score (UAS) is an established instrument to measure the
activity of chronic spontaneous urticaria. Two versions of this tool exist. For one of them, critical clinimetric data are still

missing.

What does this article add to our knowledge? We show that both UAS tools have good clinimetric properties. We define

the minimal important difference and the smallest detectable change for both instruments.

How does this study impact current management guidelines? The guideline-recommended version of the UAS with
once-daily documentation of symptoms is valid, reliable, and sensitive to change. Validity, reliability and responsiveness of
the UAS version that requires twice-daily documentation are confirmed.

BACKGROUND: Chronic spontaneous urticaria is
characterized by fluctuating symptoms. Its activity is assessed
with the urticaria activity score (UAS). Two versions of the
urticaria activity score used for 7 consecutive days (UAS7) are
available: (1) The guideline-recommended._ UAS7, with oncedaily documentation, and (2) the UAS77p, with twice-daily
documentation.

OBJECTIVE: To better characterize both UAS7 versions with
regard to their validity, reliability, sensitivity to change, minimal
important difference (MID), and smallest detectable change
(SDO).

METHODS: One hundred thirty adult patients with chronic
spontaneous urticaria completed both UAS7 versions, the
Patients Global Assessment (PatGA) of disease activity, the
Urticaria Control Test (UCT), the Chronic Urticaria Quality of
Life Questionnaire, and the Dermatology Life Quality Index
before and after the initiation of omalizumab therapy.
Physicians completed a Physician Global Assessment of disease
activity.

RESULTS: The UAS7 and the UAS77p showed high correlation
with the activity anchor PatGA (r = 0.568, P < .001 and

+ = 0.605, P< .001) and the UCT (r = —0.580, P< .001 and
r = —0.585, P < .001). The wheal and pruritus scores of the
UAS7 and the UAS7 zp exhibited respectable internal
consistency and, in each UAS7 version, correlated well with each
other (Cronbach & = 0.78, r = 0.640, P< .001, and Cronbach
a = 0.77, r = 0.626, P< .001). Changes in the UAS7 and
UAS7 rp correlated well with PatGA changes (r = 639, P< .001,
and r = .763, P< .001) and with UCT changes (r = — 0.642, P
< .001, and r = —0.703, P < .001). The MID was 11 for the
UAS7 (SDC = 12) and 12 for the UAS7;p (SDC = 11).
CONCLUSIONS: The UAS7 and UAS77p show good and
comparable clinimetric properties, including good sensitivity to
change, and similar MIDs. © 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

than 24 hours. Urticaria symptoms can fluctuate considerably on
a daily basis. As of now, reliable diagnostic and activity markers
of CSU are missing.”’” Therefore, urticaria activity can currently
be measured only by the use of patient-reported outcome
measures.

The urticaria activity score (UAS), used for 7 consecutive days
(UAS7), is an established and widely accepted patient-reported
outcome tool to prospectively measure CSU activity. It has
been used in most clinical trials in CSU in the recent years as a
main outcome parameter.” '' The UAS entails the assessment of
the 2 key urticaria signs and symptoms wheals and itch. Two
versions of this tool exist. These versions differ in 2 aspects: first,
their categories of wheal numbers, and, second, their mode of
documentation, once daily for the UAS7 and twice daily for the
UAS7rp.°'? The international EAACI/GA*LEN/EDF/WAO
guideline for urticaria recommends to use the former, the UAS7,
in medical practice and in clinical trials.” However, some critical
data on the validity, reliability, and responsiveness of this patientreported outcome measure are still missing.

The aim of this work was to better characterize and compare
both available UAS7 versions and to determine their clinimetric
properties, including validity, reliability, sensitivity to change,
minimal important difference (MID), and smallest detectable
change (SDC).

METHODS
Patient population

We included 130 consecutive adult patients referred to the urticaria specialty outpatient clinics of the Department of Dermatology
and Allergy of the Charité—Universitatsmedizin Berlin and the
Department of Dermatology in Mainz. All patients had difficultto-treat CSU (ie, they had not responded to increased doses of
second-generation antihistamines) and were eligible for omalizumab
therapy. Some of the patients, in addition to their CSU, had chronic
inducible urticaria (CIndU), but it was not predominant. The study
was approved by the local ethics committees.

Study design and outcome tools

All patients were intended to be treated with omalizumab. During the
2 weeks before the planned start of omalizumab therapy and the 4 weeks
thereafter, patients were asked to prospectively document their disease

activity by using both the UAS7 and the UAS77p.”'” Patients who

J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT
MONTH 2017

postponed their visit for omalizumab injection for no longer than 5 days
were asked to continue to complete their UAS and UASrp. In those
patients, the UASs from the first 2 weeks were used for reliability analyses,
whereas the UASs obtained in the last 7 days preceding omalizumab
injection were used for validity and responsiveness analyses, that is, to
determine the sensitivity to change, the SDC, and the MID.

In addition, patients and physicians globally assessed urticaria
activity independently with a 4-item Likert scale (none, mild,
moderate, or severe). The Patients’ Global Assessment (PatGA) of
disease activity and the Physicians’ Global Assessment (PhyGA) of
disease activity, as well as the Urticaria Control Test (UCT), the
Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire (CU-QooL), and
the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), were administered
twice: before the initiation of therapy with omalizumab and 4 weeks
thereafter.'*' In the 2 weeks before the first omalizumab administration, patients were asked to keep and not change their treatment.

Analysis of convergent validity

To determine the convergent validity of both UAS7 instruments,
we correlated (Spearman correlation) their values with those of the
above-mentioned anchors of disease activity (PatGA and PhyGA),
disease control (UCT), and HRQOL (CU-Q:oL and DLQI). For
these analyses, baseline data obtained before the initiation of omalizumab therapy were used. We hypothesized that the correlation
coefficient should be highest for the correlation between the UAS7
and the conceptually closest related anchors for disease activity.

Reliability analyses

Correlations between baseline wheal and pruritus scores of each
UAS7 version and Cronbach alpha coefficients were computed to
characterize internal consistency reliability. Cronbach alpha above
0.7 was considered as respectable.'* To investigate test-retest reliability, the UAS7 values obtained during the first week of baseline
documentation were compared with the values obtained in the
subsequent week (the week before the first injection of omalizumab)
by computing the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). A 2-way
mixed-effect and absolute agreement model has been used.'° An
ICC above 0.7 is considered to reflect excellent agreement. '“"'”
Analysis of sensitivity to change

Sensitivity to change was analyzed by computing the correlation
(Spearman correlation) of changes from baseline to 4 weeks after the
start of treatment with omalizumab, between both UAS and anchor
instruments.

Identification of the SDC

The SDC or the minimal detectable change, both of which are
used interchangeably, is a measure of the variation in a scale due to
measurement error.'*’'” A change in the score that is bigger than the
SDC is considered to reflect a real change and not just a measurement error. Different methods of calculation of the SDC exist, and
we used 2 of them.'? Accord ing to the Bland and Altman method,
the SDC, defined as a change beyond the limits of agreement, was
calculated as 1.96 x SD of the UAS change between the first week
and the second week of the baseline phase.””’*' Another method of
calculation of the SDC is based on the standard error of measurement (SEM). According to this approach, the SDC is calculated by
using the formula 1.96 x /2 x SEM and the SEM is calculated by
using the formula SD x y(1 — reliability coefficient).!"??? Here
also the longitudinal changes between the first week and the second

week of the baseline phase were considered; therefore, the ICC as a

Characterization of the MID

The MID is the smallest change that can be considered to be
clinically relevant. Two anchor-based approaches to determine the
MID were applied: the “mean change” method and a receiver
operating characteristic (ROC)-curve analysis.“*°? The PatGA was
used as an anchor. For the “mean change” method, we used the
mean change in UAS in patients who reported a 1-step change in
PatGA activity ratings between baseline and follow-up (4 weeks after
the first omalizumab administration). For the ROC-curve approach,
patients were dichotomized, on the basis of results of PatGA, into
those who improved under the therapy (defined as at least 1-step
improvement) and those who did not improve (defined by an unchanged or worsened PatGA). An alternative, distributional-criterion
approach was also applied, by dividing the baseline UAS7 SD by 2.°°
In the performed analyses, P value of .05 or less was considered as
statistically significant.

RESULTS
Patient population

The 130 antihistamine-refractory patients with CSU included
in this analysis had a mean age of 44.6 + 16.2 years, and most
(73%) was women. The clinical characteristics of the patient
population are presented in Table |.

 

 

Both UAS show good convergent validity
Both the UAS7 and the UAS7+rp correlated well with anchors
for disease activity, disease control, and HRQOL impairment.

Accordingly, both tools exhibited good levels of convergent
validity. As hypothesized, the correlations of the UAS7 and
UAS7 +p were highest with the PatGA disease activity (Table 11).
Notably, the correlations with the UCT were comparably high.

Both UAS show respectable internal consistency
and excellent test-retest reliability

The wheal scores and pruritus scores of the UAS7 (r = 0.640;
P < .001) and of the UAS7rp (7 = 0.626; P < .001) correlated
well with each other. Cronbach alpha coefficient was found to be
0.78 and 0.77 for the UAS7 and UAS7+p, respectively, indicating a respectable internal consistency of both measures.
The mean UAS7 values of the first week and the second week
of the baseline phase were 25.3 + 10.4 (median, 25) points and
24.7 + 10.3 (median, 26) points, respectively. The mean
UAS7 rp values of the first week and the second week of the
baseline phase were 27.0 + 10.2 (median, 28.5) points and 26.7
+ 10.6 (median, 28) points, respectively. The ICC was 0.91
(95% Cl, 0.86-0.94) for the UAS7 and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.890.95) for the UAS7+p; indicating excellent test-retest reliability
for both measures.

 

 

 

 

 

Both UASs are sensitive to change

Changes in the UAS7 and UAS7rp correlated well with anchors for changes in disease activity, disease control, and
HRQOL impairment. The correlations of the UAS7 and

*P < 001.

UAS7+rp changes were highest with changes in the PatGA disease
activity and UCT scores (Table III).

The MID is similar for the UAS7 and the UAS77p

UAS7 and UAS7-+p values decreased with improved PatGA
disease activity. The correlation of the UAS7 and UAS71p
changes with changes in the PatGA disease activity was r > 0.5
for both (Table III), indicating that PatGA disease activity is a
suitable anchor for the computation of the MID of the UAS7
and the UAS7+p.

The mean UAS7 and UAS7rp change for the smallest
possible improvement in PatGA disease activity (improvements
by 1 step on the Likert scale rating, eg, from “moderate” to
“mild”) was a decrease by 13.0 + 8.5 (median, 15) points and by
13.5 + 9.3 (median, 12.5) points, respectively. In contrast, the
mean UAS7 and UAS7+p decreased by only 4.7 + 8.3 (median,
3.5) points and 4.6 + 6.8 (median, 3.25) points, respectively,
when the PatGA disease activity rating did not change.
Accordingly, the mean change method suggests an MID of 13
points for the UAS7 and of 13.5 points for the UAS71p.

A second anchor-based method, an ROC-curve analysis,
showed cutoff points of 11 points for the UAS7 (Figure 1; see
Table El in this article’s Online Repository at www. jaciinpractice.org) and of 12 points for the UAS71p (Figure 2; see
Table E2 in this article’s Online Repository at www. jaciinpractice.org), to have the best balance of sensitivity and specificity for a meaningful (true) improvement in disease activity. At
these cutoff points, the sum of the proportion of patients misclassified as disease activity “improved” or “not improved” was
lowest. Accordingly, the ROC-curve analysis suggests an MID of
11 points for the UAS7 and of 12 points for the UAS77p.

The indirect distributional-criterion approach suggests an
MID of 5.2 (5 points) points for the UAS7 and of 5.4 points for
the UAS7+p, which are the SDs of the UAS7 and UAS7+p
baseline scores (10.3 and 10.7) divided by 2.

The SDC is similar for the UAS7 and the UAS7 7p

The mean UAS7 and UAS7+p difference between the first
week and the second week of the baseline phase was 0.3 + 6.0
and 0.1 + 5.3 points, respectively. According to the Bland and
Altman method, the SDC of the UAS7 was 11.8 points and the
SDC of the UAS71p was 10.5 points. According to the SEMbased method, the SDC was 5.0 points for the UAS7 and 4.1
points for the UAS7+rp.

 

 

 

 

 

 

DISCUSSION

The results of our study provide evidence that both available
variants of the UAS are appropriate and valid tools to measure
disease activity in patients with CSU.

The UAS7 and the UAS7rp showed good levels of convergent
validity, correlating moderately to strongly with other measures
of disease activity and control. Previously, an even stronger

correlation between the UCT and the UAS7 was reported
(r = —0.750).'* This may be explained by the fact that in the
UCT validation study of Weller et al,'“ the UAS was recorded
over 28 days to cover the whole 4-week recall period of the UCT,
whereas in this study, only 1-week UAS documentation was
used. The correlation between UAS7 and HRQOL instruments
was only moderate. This is in line with previous studies’”~*° and
suggests that factors other than disease activity may influence
HRQOL, as has already been shown for psychiatric comorbidities in CSU’! and for psychosocial variables in other chronic
skin diseases, for example, psoriasis.°*” aS

The internal consistency reliability of both UAS instruments is
supported by the Cronbach alpha coefficient exceeding 0.7. Testretest reliability analyses were performed using UASs of the first 2
subsequent weeks of the baseline phase to minimize the influence
of a possible fluctuation in CSU activity over a longer period.
Both UAS versions showed excellent test-retest reliability, the
UAS7 with an ICC of 0.91 and the UAS7-p with an ICC of
0.93. These values are higher than the ICC of 0.659 previously
reported for the UAS7+1p.'” The differences between the ICCs
obtained in both studies may be explained by differences between the examined patient populations.'” It is possible that
CSU in our patients was more stable during the observation
period of 2 weeks.

The UAS is used both in routine patient care and in clinical
trials to determine disease activity and response to treatment.”
Therefore, it is important to assess its responsiveness and
MID.*° We found that changes in response to treatment for both
instruments, the UAS7 and the UAS7rp, showed strong and
comparable correlations with changes in disease activity assessed

by patients and with disease control (UCT scores) as well as
moderate to strong correlations with HRQOL measures (CUQoL and DLQI scores). Thus, both UAS versions are responsive to changes in disease activity and comparable in their
sensitivity to change.

The SDC was found to be 12 points for the UAS7 and 11
points for the UAS7rp according to the Bland and Altman
method, and 5.0 points for the UAS7 and 4.1 points for the
UAS7+rp according to the SEM-based method. This implies that
changes in urticaria activity that exceed these values may be
considered with 95% of confidence to be real rather than due to
a measurement error.

To determine which changes are actually important for patients, MID values were calculated using several methods. The
lowest MID values were obtained using a distributional-criterion
approach. This approach, however, does not take into account
changes in disease activity; thus, anchor-based methods are
preferred.°” We applied 2 anchor-based approaches to determine
the MID, the “mean change” method and the ROC-curve
analysis. The “mean change” method yielded higher values as
compared with the ROC-curve analysis. We recommend the use
of the MID obtained from the ROC-curve analysis rather than
from the “mean change” method, because the first approach also
includes patients whose urticaria activity did not improve during
the observation period. The MID value of 12 points for the
UAS7-rp, obtained by using the ROC-curve analysis, exceeds the
measurement error (SDC) of 11 obtained using the method of
Bland and Altman.*°*! Thus, changes in the UAS7yp between
11 and 12 points should be interpreted as real but not important
to the patients. In contrast, the MID value of 11 points for the
UAS7, obtained from the ROC-curve analysis, lies below its
SDC value of 12. Thus, changes in the UAS7 above 12 points
should be interpreted as real and important to the patients. The
SDC values based on the SEM were lower than the MIDs for
both the UAS7 and the UAS7p. The SEM-related SDC value
of 4.1 for the UAS7rp was similar to the values 3.5 to 4.0 obtained by Mathias et al!? using the same method.!* Our study,
for the first time, delivers evidence for the MID of the UAS7.
Our results obtained for the UAS7-rp are slightly higher than the
MID range of 9.5 to 10.5 recommended by Mathias et al.'*

 

 

 

 

HAWRO ET AL 5

Our study has several limitations, which should be mentioned.
(1) The recruited patients may not be fully representative of the
overall population of patients with CSU because all of them were
German, refractory to antihistamine treatment, and were treated
in a specialized, tertiary reference center of a university hospital.
(2) Changes in disease activity were observed only in response to
one type of treatment, and only few patients worsened under
therapy, which prevented a reliable estimation of the MID for
worsening of the symptoms. (3) Patients with CIndU were not
excluded from the study as long as CSU was predominant
because we aimed to test UAS validity under real-life conditions.
As much as 36% of patients with CSU were recently reported to
have comorbid CIndU.*° In this group, activity of inducible
urticaria may influence the UAS, because it may be difficult for
the patients to differentiate to what extent their symptoms are
due to CSU and to what extent due to CIndU. However, we
believe, that in these patients, the UAS7 is still the best tool to
measure disease activity. In contrast, if symptoms of physical
urticaria prevail, monitoring of its activity should be in the first
line on the basis of available physical testing. (4) A considerable
dropout rate between the first visit and the second visit was
observed, which resulted in a lower number of patients included
in the analyses of sensitivity to change, SDC and MID, only.

This study provides, for the first time, validation data for the
UAS7 and confirms as well as extends the previous US validation
data for the UAS7rp in German patients with CSU. Because of
the very simple linguistic structure of the UAS and its straightforward questions, no significant cross-linguistic and crosscultural differences are to be expected in different populations.
It cannot be excluded, however, that the disease activity of the
patients in the setting of this study (tertiary care) is higher as
compared with other patient groups treated in a primary or
secondary care setting. This may have an effect on the UAS
values but rather not on the results of the UAS validity and
reliability. Therefore, we believe that the results of this study can
be applied to different populations and generalized, even though
it was performed in a relatively homogenous population.

In conclusion, our results show good and comparable clinimetric properties of both instruments, including good levels of
validity, reliability, and sensitivity to change, with a recommendable MID and an SDC of 12 and 11 for the UAS7+p and
of 11 and 12 for the UAS7, respectively.
