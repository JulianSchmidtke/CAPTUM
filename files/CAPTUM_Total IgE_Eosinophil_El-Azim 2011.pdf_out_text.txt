@ Abstract

Background: Chronic autoimmune urticaria (CAU), a subgroup of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), is characterized by severe and persistent
wheals accompanied by redness and itching. Diagnosis is almost completely based on clinical suspicion and the results of the autologous
serum skin test (ASST).

Objectives: To determine the frequency of CAU and compare the clinical and laboratory parameters of patients with positive and negative ASST results.
Patients and Methods: A total of 165 patients with chronic urticaria (CU) were enrolled; 31 were excluded (known causes and pregnancy/
breastfeeding), leaving 134 patients with CIU. A clinical evaluation and routine and specific laboratory tests were performed.

Results: The cause of CU was identified in 18.9% of patients; 81.2% patients were considered to have CIU. The ASST result was positive
in 39.6% of patients with CIU, who had more frequent urticaria attacks than patients with a negative ASST result. Patients with positive
results had a higher urticaria activity score than those with negative results, although the difference was not statistically significant. As
for immunological markers, the absolute eosinophil count and serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E titer were lower in patients with a positive
ASST result than in those with a negative ASST result, although, again, the difference was not statistically significant (P=.07). Antithyroid
antibody titer and B-cell percentage were higher in patients with a positive ASST result than in those with a negative result, and the
difference was statistically significant (P=.04 and .004, respectively).

Conclusions: ASST remains a baseline diagnostic test for CAU. Patients with CAU had more frequent attacks and higher antithyroid antibody
titers and peripheral B-cell percentages, as well as lower absolute eosinophil counts and serum IgE concentrations.

Key words: Autologous serum skin test. Chronic urticaria. Autoimmunity.

Antecedentes: La urticaria cronica autoinmunitaria (UCA), un subgrupo de urticaria cronica idiopatica (UCI), se caracteriza por la presencia
de habones de caracter grave y persistente acompafiados de enrojecimiento y prurito. El diagndstico se basa casi por completo en la
sospecha clinica y los resultados de la prueba cutanea con suero autdlogo (PCSA).
Objetivos: Determinar la frecuencia de la UCA y comparar los parametros clinicos y de laboratorio de pacientes con resultados positivos

Resultados: La causa de la UC se identificd en un 18,9% de los pacientes; se consideré que un 81,2% de pacientes padecia UCI. El resultado
de la PCSA fue positivo en un 39,6% de pacientes con UCI, que tenian episodios de urticaria con mayor frecuencia que los pacientes con un
resultado negativo en la PCSA. Los pacientes con resultados positivos presentaron una puntuacidn de actividad de urticaria mas elevada que
aquellos con resultados negativos, si bien la diferencia no fue estadisticamente significativa. En cuanto a los marcadores inmunoldgicos, el
recuento absoluto de eosindfilos y el titulo de inmunoglobulina (Ig) E en suero fueron mas bajos en pacientes con un resultado positivo en
la PCSA que en aquellos con un resultado negativo en dicha prueba, aunque, de nuevo, la diferencia no fue estadisticamente significativa
(p =0,07). El titulo de anticuerpos antitiroideos y el porcentaje de linfocitos B fueron mayores en los pacientes con un resultado positivo en
la PCSA que en aquellos con un resultado negativo, y la diferencia fue estadisticamente significativa (p =0,04 y 0,004, respectivamente).
Conclusiones: La PCSA sigue siendo una prueba diagndstica basica para la UCA. Los pacientes con UCA presentaron episodios mas
frecuentes, titulos de anticuerpos antitiroideos y porcentajes de linfocitos B periféricos mas elevados, asi como recuentos absolutos de
eosindfilos y concentraciones séricas de IgE mas bajos.

Introduction

Chronic urticaria (CU) is acommon skin disorder, affecting
0.1%-1% of the general population. It is characterized by
recurrent and transitory (<24 hours) pruritic erythematous
wheals that present at least twice weekly for at least 6 weeks
[1]. Several investigators have demonstrated a subgroup
of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), chronic autoimmune
urticaria (CAU), which affects 30%-50% of CIU patients [2-4].

Immune dysregulation in CAU is characterized by a
systemic inflammatory profile associated with abnormal
B-cell-induced immunoglobulin (Ig) E production and
T-cell—-induced cytokine production [5].

CAU is characterized by the presence of functional
autoantibodies that activate mast cells and basophils. About
50% of these antibodies are functional IgG autoantibodies
that bind to the high-affinity IgE receptor FceRI, and 9% bind
to the IgE antibody itself [6]. Their presence is consistent
with disease exacerbation [7].

Diagnosis of CAU is based on clinical suspicion and
in vivo and in vitro tests to determine functional histamine
release from basophils or mast cells. The autologous serum
skin test (ASST) is an in vivo test that assesses autoreactivity
in CAU patients, particularly during the active phases of
the disease. It may be an indication of mast cell—activating
autoantibodies that act either indirectly through the release
of mediators from cutaneous mast cells and other cells or
directly in the microvasculature of the skin. The sensitivity
of the test is approximately 70% and the specificity 80% [8].
Hence, the presence of functional autoantibodies should be
confirmed by in vitro tests such as the basophil histamine
release assay and immunoassay [9].

Despite being the gold standard for detecting functional
autoantibodies, the basophil histamine release assay is a
time-consuming procedure that is difficult to standardize [10].
Furthermore, attempts to develop successful Western blot
assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays continue to
be unsuccessful [11,12].

Identification of an autoimmune cause can help to rule out the
need to continue searching for other etiologies. Early diagnosis
is important, as patients need high doses of antihistamines,
systemic corticosteroids, and immunomodulatory drugs in
severe cases [13]. Therefore, we aimed to determine the
frequency of CAU among patients with CIU attending our
Allergy and Immunology Unit and to identify any clinical and
laboratory findings related to positivity of ASST.

Patients and Methods

From December 2009 to October 2010, we recruited
165 patients with CU from the Allergy and Immunology
Unit of the Microbiology and Immunology Department,
Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.
A diagnosis of CU was defined as recurrent episodes of
wheals, with or without angioedema, of at least 6 weeks
duration [14]. Patients had to be off antihistamines for at
least 2-3 days (long-acting antihistamines for 7 days) [9,15]

fumigatus), mixed pollens, and hay dust. Written informe

and corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs
for 4 weeks before the study to reduce the possibility of
generating false-negative results. The etiology of CU was
evaluated using the medical history, clinical examination, an
laboratory tests. The data recorded from the medical history
included duration of disease, frequency of attacks, associate
angioedema, dermographism, and history of atopy. Clinical
examination included both general and dermatologica
examinations. Laboratory tests [16] included complete
blood count, liver function tests, kidney function tests, and
infection panel (hepatitis surface antigen, antibody titers for
hepatitis B and C virus, throat culture, urine analysis an
culture, and microscopic examination of stool for parasites).
In order to rule out allergic causes of urticaria we performed
skin prick tests with the following common allergens: house
dust mite, human hair, tobacco smoke, wool, cotton, mixe:
fungus (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus

 

consent was obtained from all patients.

Exclusion Criteria

We excluded 31 patients who were pregnant or breastfeeding
or had a known cause of CU.

The remaining 134 patients with CIU underwent the
following evaluations:

1. Urticaria activity score (UAS) [17].

2. Peripheral blood eosinophil count. Eosinophilia was
defined as a count >5% or >350 cells/mm? [18].

3. Serum total IgE level (Immundiagnostik IgE ELISA kit,
Immundiagnostik AG, Bensheim, Germany).

4. Antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibody (Medizym
anti-TPO ELISA, Medipan Diagnostica, Dahlewitz/
Berlin, Germany). All the procedures were performed
according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Anti-TPO
antibody values of >30 IU/mL were considered positive.

5. Flow cytometry. The percentage of CD3- CD19*
B lymphocytes in peripheral blood was detected.
Two-color analysis was performed using monoclonal
antibodies marked with CD 19-fluorescein isothiocyanate
(HIB19 clone; BD Pharmingen, San Diego, California,
USA) and CD3-allophycocyanin (UCHT Iclone;
BD PharMingen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cells were analyzed using a FACScan flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Diego, California,
USA) and CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson,
Mountainview, California, USA).

6. ASST technique. Patients received an intradermal
injection (50 uL of autologous serum, histamine
diphosphate, and sterile physiological saline) into the
volar forearm [15,19], avoiding areas known to have
had spontaneous wheals in the previous 48 hours (mast
cells may be refractory to further activation [local
tachyphylaxis]) [20]. After 30 minutes (15 minutes for
histamine), the wheal was measured at its 2 longest
perpendicular diameters and the average was calculated
[6]. A positive ASST result was defined as a seruminduced wheal with a diameter of =1.5 mm as compared
to a saline-induced wheal at 30 minutes (Figure).

Statistical Analysis

Data were recorded and processed using SPSS version 12.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). Quantitative variables
were expressed as mean (SD) and compared using the MannWhitney test for 2 independent variables. Qualitative variables
were expressed as frequency and percentage and compared
using the x? test or Fisher exact test when appropriate. A
P value <.05 was considered significant.

Higher anti-TPO antibody titers and B-cell percentages
were recorded in patients with a positive ASST result
than in those with a negative result, and the difference
was significant (P=.04 and .004, respectively).

Discussion

The ASST showed that CAU affected 39.6% of our
patients. The prevalence of positive ASST results in CU
patients has been reported to vary from 34% to 67% in various
studies [21-23]. Differences in frequency according to ethnic
group suggest a genetic background [9]. In addition, ASST
may generate false-positive results owing to the presence of
mast cell—specific nonimmunoglobulin histamine—releasing
factors [24] and clotted blood generates bradykinin [6]. We
found no significant differences between the groups for
age or associated angioedema. This finding agreed with the
previous study of Kulthanan et al [25]. However, our study
did detect a female predominance in CAU patients, a finding
that is consistent with those of Caproni et al [21]. We found
no significant differences in disease duration between the
2 groups, as was the case with George et al [26] in India.
By contrast, Boguniewicz [27] found that disease duration
was significantly longer in patients with a positive ASST
result than in patients with a negative result. Frequent attacks
(>5 times/week) were significantly more common in ASSTpositive patients than in ASST-negative patients. This finding
was consistent with the results of George et al and could be
explained by the difficulty in controlling CAU.

Our study showed that the severity of urticaria was greater,
although not significantly so, if the ASST result was positive. This
is consistent with the findings of Bajaj et al [17]. However, Caproni
et al [21] found that patients with a positive ASST result presented
more severe clinical features than those with a negative result.

As for immunological markers, absolute eosinophil count
was not significantly lower in patients with a positive ASST
result, although it was within the upper limits of normal. This
reduction is consistent with the accumulation of eosinophils
in lesional skin [28]: eosinophils are recruited following the
release of cytokines and chemotactic factors and activation and
recruitment of adhesion molecules on migrating eosinophils
and on endothelial cells [29]. The role of tissue eosinophilia
is unclear, although it is possible that release of toxic major
basic protein and eosinophil cationic protein further augments
histamine release from mast cells in the late phase of the
urticarial wheal [9].

We found that a positive ASST result was more likely to
be associated with significantly lower IgE levels than ASSTnegative patients. This finding agrees with those of Huilan et
al [5], who attributed this association to IgE—anti-IgE immune
complex formation that reduces the amount of detectable free
IgE in patients with anti-IgE autoantibodies. In contrast, other
authors showed serum IgE level to be significantly higher in
ASST-positive patients [6,30], and this could be due to an
improvement in CAU patients after treatment with the anti-IgE
antibody omalizumab, which selectively binds to IgE, thus
decreasing IgE receptor density on basophils and cutaneous
mast cells and preventing activation by autoantibodies [6].

 

J Investig Allergol Clin Immunol 2011; Vol. 21(7): 546-550

The significant association between a positive ASST result
and anti-TPO antibody titer is consistent with the findings of
other studies and can be explained by segregation of anti-TPO
antibodies from IgE receptor antibodies because of B-cell
hyperreactivity [23,31]. However, other authors did not detect
a difference in the incidence of thyroid disease, probably as a
result of insufficient sample size (thyroid autoimmunity occurs
in less than 6% of the general population) [32]. Finally, we
found that ASST-positive CAU patients were more likely to
be associated with a higher percentage of B cells. This finding
agrees with those of Huilan et al [5] and Toubi et al [33], who
reported increased proliferation rates and decreased apoptosis
rates for B cells.

In conclusion, ASST is a baseline diagnostic test for CAU.
Patients with CAU have more frequent attacks and higher antiTPO antibody titers and peripheral B-cell percentages, as well
as lower absolute blood eosinophil counts and serum IgE titers.

Thyroid function and anti-TPO antibody titers should
be routinely assessed in CU patients. In addition, successful
therapy for urticaria should target the regulatory pathway
linking B cells and IgE in order to downregulate FceRI
expression.
