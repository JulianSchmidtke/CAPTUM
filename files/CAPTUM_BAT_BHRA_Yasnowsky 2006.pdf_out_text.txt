Background: Approximately 40% of patients with chronic
idiopathic urticaria have antibodies to the a subunit of the
high-affinity IgE receptor. CD203c is a basophil activation
marker known to be upregulated by cross-linking of the
FceRIa receptor and may serve as a useful marker to identify
these patients.

Objective: The primary objective was to assess the affect of
sera from patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria on basophil
CD203c expression. Secondary objectives were to correlate
CD203c expression with basophil histamine release and size
of the autologous serum skin test and to determine whether the
mechanism is mediated by an IgG antibody.

Methods: Sera were obtained from patients with chronic
idiopathic urticaria and positive autologous serum skin test
or negative autologous serum skin test and normal controls.
Sera were incubated with donor whole blood. Activated
basophils from whole blood were identified by flow cytometry
on the basis of the presence of CD203c on high-expressing
IgE positive cells.

Results: Incubation of donor basophils with sera from
patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria and positive
autologous serum skin test demonstrated significant
upregulation of CD203c. IgG depletion of representative sera
from patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria resulted in
significant decrease in CD203c expression on donor basophils.
CD203c expression correlated with basophil histamine release
and the size of the autologous serum skin test.

Conclusion: Sera from patients with chronic idiopathic
urticaria and positive autologous serum skin test significantly
upregulate basophil CD203c and correlate with basophil
histamine release.

Clinical implications: This article describes an activation
marker on basophils whose expression is increased by sera
from patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria. (J Allergy Clin
Immunol 2006;117:1430-4.)

Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CU) is defined as recurrent
hives occurring for at least 6 weeks. In the majority of
cases, there is no identifiable trigger despite extensive
evaluation for an underlying etiology. A subset of these
patients is classified as having autoimmune urticaria
defined by the presence of a functional IgG antibody to
the a subunit of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRIa)
or to IgE.' These antibodies trigger mast cell and basophil degranulation by the engagement of this receptor.
Functional IgG antibody to the receptor has been identified in approximately 30% to 40% of patients with CU,
and anti-IgE antibody has been identified in another 5%
to 10% of patients. Nonfunctional antibodies to FceRI
may be found in other autoimmune conditions.”

Techniques to detect the autoantibody to FceRla
include Western blot and ELISA, which are technically
time-consuming and fail to identify antibodies with histamine releasing properties. Detection methods for functional antibodies include the autologous serum skin test
(ASST) and basophil histamine release (BHR). The ASST
involves an intradermal injection of the patient’s serum
into the skin with observation for a wheal and flare
reaction. ASST is approximately 70% sensitive and 80%
specific compared with the BHR assay.°

Recently, flow cytometry has been used to identify
activated basophils in both allergic disease and CU. Two
studies have been published demonstrating that sera of
patients with CU and positive ASST induce higher
expression of CD63 compared with skin test—negative
chronic urticaria sera.*” CD63, a member of the transmembrane-4 superfamily, is a basophil and mast cell activation marker expressed as a result of the fusion between
intracytoplasmic granules and the plasma membrane. It
has been proposed that it rapidly appears on the basophil
surface on the addition of anti-IgE, allergen, or IL-3.°”
However, CD63 is not specific to basophils and mast cells
but can be expressed on other cells present in the peripheral blood, such as monocytes and platelets.*

CD203c (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase) is an ectoenzyme expressed only on basophils,
mast cells, and their CD34* progenitor cells in the peripheral blood.* It has been described that CD203c may
be a better basophil activation marker because of its

specificity and potentially increased sensitivity in detecting IgE-mediated hypersensitivity.° CD203c is expressed
on both resting and activated basophils and is upregulated
in response to cross-linking of the FceRIa receptor.'°
CD203c has been used to evaluate IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to latex and aeroallergens.”'! Upregulation of
CD203c on peripheral blood basophils from patients
with CU has also been described.'*

In the current study, we sought to compare the effect
of sera from ASST* and ASST patients with CU on
basophil CD203c expression to normal control sera and
to determine the correlation with BHR. In addition, IgG
depletion of sera from ASST* individuals was performed
to determine whether the mechanism of CD203c upregulation is IgG-mediated.

METHODS
Patients and controls

Chronic idiopathic urticaria was defined as recurrent wheals
occurring at least 3 times per week for more than 6 weeks without
an identifiable cause. Patients were excluded if they had evidence of
a known trigger or cause including physical urticaria, urticarial
vasculitis, or allergic cause of their hives. Sera were obtained from
32 patients with CU at the time of ASST and stored at —-80°C.
Antihistamines were held for at least 48 hours before collection of
sera. Eleven sera from healthy adult individuals were used as normal
controls. Four sera with a high titer antinuclear antibody (ANA) >
1:360, 3 with a history of active connective tissue disease, and the
other with eosinophilic gastroenteritis were used for disease controls.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the
National Jewish Medical and Research Center.

ASST

The test was performed by injecting 0.05 cc of the patient’s own
serum intradermally into the volar aspect of the forearm. Sterile saline
and histamine were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Wheal and flare reactions were measured at 30 minutes. A
mean wheal diameter of 2 mm greater than or equal to the control was
considered to be a positive ASST.

Basophil donor

‘Whole blood from 7 normal individuals was screened, and | donor
was identified on the basis of the marked upregulation of CD203c on
basophils (CD203c/IgE positive cells) in response to f-Met-Leu-Phe
(fMLP) and anti-FceRIa antibody. The basophil donor was atopic
and had a serum IgE level of 154 kU/L. The basophil donor provided
informed consent and was bled <1 time per week.

 

Yasnowsky et al 1431

IgG depletion

Selected patients’ and normal control patients’ sera were depleted
of IgG using a protein G-Sepharose column (Sigma, St Louis, Mo).
Pre and post IgG depletion levels were measured by nephelometry
(Immage Immunochemistry System; Beckman Coulter, Fullerton,
Calif). All sera had postdepletion levels of <33.3 mg/dL (the lowest
level of detection by nephelometry). Dilution of sera passing through
the column was accounted for by measuring serum albumin levels
predepletion and postdepletion.

Antibodies

The following mAbs were used: phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated
antihuman CD203¢ (Beckman Coulter), peridinin-chlorophyll-protein complex (PerCP)-conjugated antihuman CD45 (BD Bioscience,
San Jose, Calif), and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated
antihuman IgE (Caltag, Burlingame, Calif).

Measurement of CD203c surface expression

The test was performed on heparinized blood within 3 to 4 hours
after drawing the donor’s blood. Aliquots of the donor’s heparinized
whole blood (200 L) were incubated for 10 minutes at 37°C with
40 \xL sera from patients with CU or normal controls, or IgG-depleted
sera. For controls, 40 «L basophil stimulation buffer (20 mM
HEPES, 125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCh, 1 mM MgCh,
0.5 mM glucose, and 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4) was added to 200 tL of
donor’s blood and used as the negative control, and 40 pL 2-~M
fMLP (Sigma) and 40 wL of a 1:50 dilution of anti-FceRIa receptor
antibody (Upstate, Charlottesville, Va) in Ca** and Mg** free PBS
were used as positive controls. The reactions were stopped by placing
the tubes on ice. Cells were then stained with PE-antihuman CD45,
PerCP-antihuman CD203c, and FITC-antihuman IgE at 4°C in the
dark for 30 minutes. Red cells were lysed with FACS Lysing
Solution (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, Calif). The cells were then
washed once with 2 mL PBS and fixed in 1% formaldehyde. The cells
were then analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton
Dickinson).

Flow cytometry

Basophils from whole blood were identified by the presence of
CD203c on high-expressing IgE* cells (Fig 1, A and B). The data are
expressed as the mean fluorescence intensity or the percentage of
CD203c expression. Percent CD203c expression is defined as the percent of basophils expressing more CD203c than >99% of basophils
incubated with buffer only. This was determined by defining an MI
region on the histogram analysis (Fig 1, C).

BHR

Whole blood from the same donor for the CD203c assay was
collected in a heparinized tube, and BHR was performed according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Beckman Coulter). For the BHR,
whole blood was diluted 1:7 in the histamine release buffer. Stimuli
(50 L) including patient sera, anti-FceRI (as a positive control), or
histamine release buffer (as a negative control) were added to 100 pL
blood and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. To determine total
histamine, whole blood was diluted 1:20 in distilled water followed by
2 rapid freeze-thaw cycles. Histamine concentrations in the supernatants of centrifuged blood were performed by ELISA (Beckman
Coulter) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Spontaneous
histamine release was determined by the amount of histamine released
by cells incubated with the histamine release buffer. Spontaneous
release was <5% of total release. Positive histamine release was
defined as >15% of total release.’

ANA determination

Antinuclear antibodies were detected by indirect immunofluorescence with HEp-2 cells (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Redmond, Wash).

Statistics

Significant differences between groups were analyzed by using a
2-tailed unpaired ¢ test. Correlation was determined by using Pearson
product moment correlation. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and
positive predictive value were also calculated.

RESULTS
Basophil CD203c expression

CD203c expression was higher in basophils incubated
with sera from patients with CU compared with normal
control individuals (Fig 2). The mean percent basophil
CD203c expression of 11 normal control individuals
was —0.6% + 0.1% (SEM) versus 20% + 4% in 32 patients with CU (P = .002). Sera from patients with hightiter ANAs (disease controls) did not induce basophil
CD203c expression. The mean values of the positive

and 41.9% + 9.4% (n = 4), respectively.

CD203c expression was significantly higher after
incubation of basophils with sera from ASST~ patients
with CU than normal control sera (P < .001; Fig 3). The
mean percent CD203c expression was 30% + 5 (SEM;
n = 22) in basophils incubated with ASST CU sera versus -0.6% + 0.1% for normal control sera (n = 11). The
range of percent CD203c expression in cells incubated
with ASST* serum was —0.1% to 63.3%. Seventeen of
22 ASST* sera (77%) resulted in basophil activation of
greater than 5%. The range of percent basophil activation
in cells incubated with normal control serum was —1.2% to
0.0% compared with buffer control. CD203c expression
was also significantly higher in basophils incubated with
ASST* sera than with ASST~ sera (P = .006). The
mean percent CD203c expression was 30% + 5% versus
6% + 3%, respectively. The range of CD203c expression
for basophils incubated with ASST” sera was 0.1% to
24%. Eight of 10 ASST” sera resulted in CD203c expression of <5%, and the other 2 resulted in 22% and 24%
expression. Incubation with ASST” sera also resulted in
significantly higher CD203c expression than control sera
(P = .04).

insufficient quantity. In patients with negative ASST, 1 of
10 (10%) had a positive BHR, and 4 of 18 (22%) patients
with positive ASSTs had a negative BHR. The percent
CD203c expression correlated with the percent histamine
release (R = 0.6; P = .001; Fig 4). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive
value were calculated by using the BHR assay as the
gold standard to identify functional antibodies to the
FceRIa receptor and by using >5% CD203c expression
as the cutoff value for a positive test. With these criteria,
CD203c expression demonstrated a sensitivity of 77%, a
specificity of 82%, a positive predictive value of 83%,
and a negative predictive value of 75%.

Correlation between ASST
and CD203c expression

The mean diameter of the serum autologous skin test
was compared with percent CD203c expression. Results
demonstrated a significant correlation between the size
of the ASST and CD203c expression (R = 0.5; P = .02;
Fig 5).

IgG depletion

To determine if the mechanism of CD203c expression
was mediated by an IgG antibody, 3 selected sera that
induced basophil CD203c expression were depleted of
IgG using a protein G Sepharose column. The mean
percent CD203c expression before IgG depletion was
30% + 9%. The mean percent CD203c expression after
IgG depletion was 5% + 1%, suggesting that in these sera,
CD203c expression may be triggered by an IgG antibody
to FceRIa. There was no change from pre and post IgG
depletion with 2 control sera: 0.2% + 0.4% (pre) and
—0.1% + 0.02% (post; P = .5).

DISCUSSION

Results from this study demonstrate that the sera from
patients with CU upregulate basophil CD203c expression.
Sera from patients with positive ASST induced significantly higher CD203c expression compared with the sera
from patients with negative ASST and from normal
controls. Twenty percent of patients’ sera with negative
ASSTs induced >5% basophil activation compared with
buffer control. Seventy-seven percent of patients with
positive ASSTs had >5% basophil activation. It is an

interesting observation that the sera from ASST patients
induced significantly higher CD203c expression than
normal controls, although still significantly lower than
ASST* patients. The 2 patients with negative autologous
serum skin tests and sera inducing an elevation of CD203c
of more than 5% may represent those patients with falsenegative ASST. However, on reanalyzing the data without
the 2 outlying sera, ASST CU sera still induces CD203c
expression, more so than controls. This finding suggests
that there are other undefined serum factors present in
CU sera that can upregulate CD203c.

CD203c is known to be upregulated by cross-linking of
FceRIa by transport of preformed CD203c molecules to
the surface.'* The decline in CD203c expression after IgG
depletion of representative sera is consistent with an IgGmediated mechanism. This experiment did not remove IgE
from donor basophils, so the results do not differentiate
between an IgG antibody to the FceRIa subunit or to IgE.

In comparison with our results, Wedi et al* found
increased CD63 expression in 70% of ASST* patients
with CU and 45% of ASST” patients with CU, and in
35% of controls. Gyimesi et al° found elevated CD63
expression induced by 11 of 12 ASST* sera (92%) and
3 of 18 (17%) ASST” sera. These results using CD63
are similar to our findings with CD203c, although Wedi
et al* had a higher percentage of normal controls inducing
CD63 expression and Gyimesi et al° had a higher percentage of ASST* sera inducing CD63 expression.

CD203c belongs to the type II transmembrane protein
family and is a multifunctional ectoenzyme called ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 3 that
catalyzes the cleavage of several molecules, including
deoxynucleotides and nucleotide sugars. It also contains
a somatomedin B-like domain and a cell adhesive motif,
but their potential functions are unknown. Among leukocytes, CD203c appears to be selectively expressed on the
basophil/mastocyte lineage. Boumiza et al? compared basophil activation tests using either CD63 or CD203c in the
diagnosis of latex allergy and found that the sensitivity
was considerably higher with CD203c (75%, compared
with 50% with CD63). The authors speculate that the
improved sensitivity may be a result of 2 factors. First,
the recognition of basophils is superior with CD203c.
Second, CD203c is expressed at a higher level in activated
basophils compared with CD63. In sensitized patients,
basophils increased their CD203c levels as much as 350%

above control values in response to allergens, whereas the
increase in CD63 was below 100%. However, it should
be pointed out that few comparative studies have been
performed, and further studies are needed to establish
the validity and superiority of these tests. The difference
in response between CD203c and CD63 can be explained
by their different mechanism of upregulation. For example, PGD2 is a strong inducer of CD203c expression.
However, it does not stimulate CD63 expression.'> The
kinetics of upregulation of CD203c is fast and peaks after
5 to 15 minutes, whereas that of CD63 is slow and peaks
after 20 to 40 minutes. '°

It is also interesting to note that some recently identified
surface markers follow the upregulation kinetics of either
CD203c or CD63. Thus, the upregulation of CD13 and
CD164 is fast and similar to that of CD203c. On the other
hand, the surface increase of CD107a is slow and follows
the kinetics of CD63.'°

Our results indicate that donor basophil expression of
CD203c is increased by incubation of donor basophils
with sera from patients with chronic urticaria and is
consistent with an IgG-mediated mechanism. Assessing
basophil activation with CD203c may be a useful way to
identify individuals with autoimmune urticaria.

We thank Dr Donald MacGlashan, Jr, Johns Hopkins University,
Asthma and Allergy Center, for his suggestion to use CD203¢ as a
marker of human basophils.
