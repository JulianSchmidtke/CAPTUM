What is already known about this topic? A basophil functional abnormality has been reported because some patients
with chronic spontaneous urticaria have less histamine release to anti-IgE.

What does this article add to our knowledge? Attenuated basophil responsiveness via FceRI in patients with chronic

spontaneous urticaria is associated with the severity of disease and relatively shorter disease duration.

How does this study impact current management guidelines? Classification of chronic spontaneous urticaria patients
according to basophil CD203c reactivity may help to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the dysregulation of basophils

 

and their role in the pathogenesis of urticaria.

BACKGROUND: The insufficient effect of H1-antihistamine in
some patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) suggests
that factors other than histamine are involved in the pathophysiology of CSU. Moreover, a central role for basophils in the
pathophysiology of CSU has been hypothesized. However, few
studies have focused on the relationship between basophil
reactivity via FceRI and clinical features in patients with CSU.
OBJECTIVE: To assess basophil reactivity via FceRI against
anti-IgE and FceRI stimulation in patients with CSU, and its
association with disease activity in CSU. FceRI expression and
IgE binding on basophils from patients with CSU were also
investigated.

METHODS: We analyzed 38 patients with CSU, 8 patients with
atopic dermatitis (AD), and 11 healthy controls (HCs). The
surface CD203c expression with or without anti-IgE or FceRI
stimulation, and IgE and FceRI (CRA1, CRA2) expression on
blood basophils were evaluated. Patients with CSU were also
evaluated and classified by disease activity and the above parameters were compared.

RESULTS: The proportion of CD203c'8" basophils after antiIgE or anti-FceRI stimulation was lower in patients with CSU
compared with HCs and patients with AD. It was lowest in the

CSU group with severe disease. Basophils from patients with
CSU had higher FceRI (CRA1) expression, although it was not
closely related to the severity of CSU. Subgroup analysis revealed
that patients with CSU showing low responsiveness of basophils
via FceRI exhibited a short duration of disease but severe disease
activity.

CONCLUSIONS: Low reactivity of basophils via FceRI is
characteristic of patients with CSU. This attenuated reactivity is
associated with severe clinical activity in patients with CSU (250

Key words: Chronic spontaneous urticaria; CD203c; Basophil
activation test

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common skin disease, characterized by spontaneous appearance of wheals,
angioedema, or both for more than 6 weeks due to known
(ie, the presence of mast cell—activating autoantibodies) or unknown causes.'’? Histamine from activated skin mast cells plays
a central role in the pathophysiological aspects of CSU; however,
H1-antihistamine treatment leads to the absence of symptoms in
fewer than 50% of patients with CSU.° This suggests that factors other than histamine from mast cells are involved in the
pathophysiology of CSU. Thus, other inflammatory cells
including basophils are currently being investigated. Histologically, a perivascular infiltrate of mixed inflammatory cells,
including basophils, is present in skin lesions of patients with
csu.*° Recently, the expression of activation markers has been
assessed on the surface of basophils in patients with CSU.
CD203c, also known as ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase3 (E-NPP3),’ isa basophil activation marker that is
upregulated in the steady state on the basophils of patients with
csu.® According to Lourenco et al,” upregulation of CD203c
expression without stimulation of the basophils was present in
patients with CSU, regardless of autologous serum skin test
(ASST) responses. In other cases, the ASST reflects histaminereleasing anti-FceRI autoantibodies, suggesting that would

correlate with basophil activation mar! ers.'° Furthermore, Ye
et al'' mentioned that basophil CD203c expression in patients
with severe CSU was significantly higher than in nonsevere CSU.
In addition, the reactivity of basophils from patients with CSU
has been assessed via various detection methods. A previous study
reported that basophils of some patients with CSU exhibit little
histamine release in response to anti-IgE. '? Furthermore, CD63
expression of basophils after anti-FceRI stimulation is less in a
subgroup of patients with CSU than basophils of healthy controls (HCs).'° In contrast, another report documented that patients with CSU with high histamine release response to anti-IgE
experienced significantly higher current itch scores compared
with nonresponders.“ In addition, the activated status of CSU
basophils was reported based on enhancement of histamine
release induced by anti-IgE stimulus.’

The expression of FceRI and bound IgE on basophils from
patients with CSU plays an important role in the pathophysiology and therapeutic response to omalizumab in CSU. Omalizumab binds to free IgE, which lowers its level, and causes
downregulation of FceRI receptors on basophils and mast cells.'”
Furthermore, the expression of FceRI (CRA1) is increased on the
basophils of patients with CSU compared with HCs, and a
positive correlation was found between IgE serum levels and
FceRI receptor expression."

Thus, basophils are noteworthy cells in terms of playing a
critical role in the pathophysiology of CSU. Indeed, Saini
et al'” reported that blood basophil percentage and numbers
increased in patients with CSU in response to treatment with
omalizumab. However, few studies have focused on the association between basophil reactivity via FceRI, levels of
FceRI and IgE on basophils, and clinical features including
disease activity in patients with CSU. Furthermore, few
studies have also compared the reactivity of basophils from
patients with CSU and patients with other inducible types of
urticaria.

In this study, we analyzed the expression of the activation
marker CD203c with or without anti-IgE and FceRI stimulation
in patients with CSU, patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), and
HCs to detect basophil reactivity via FceRI stimulation.
Furthermore, we examined the association between basophil
reactivity via FceRI and disease severity of CSU. In addition, the
degree of IgE binding as well as FceRI receptor (CRA1, CRA2)
expression on basophils was analyzed and the association between
receptor expression and disease activity in CSU was examined.
We also discussed the clinical features of subgroups of patients
with CSU divided according to basophil CD203c upregulation
via FceRI expression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population

Patients with CSU and AD who agreed to participate in this study
were enrolled at the Dermatological Institute of Kobe University
Hospital. CSU was defined as recurrent wheals occurring for more
than 6 weeks without an identifiable cause. HCs were enrolled from
healthy adult volunteers who are currently without symptoms of
urticaria and no history of urticaria. Disease activity in patients with
CSU was assessed both in clinical care and trials with the urticaria
activity score 7 (UAS7). The UAS is the sum of the urticaria and
itching scores, and UAS7 (which is the total of 7 days of UAS scores)
can evaluate CSU activity over 1 week.'* The UAS7 is recommended by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) guidelines as a method for evaluating disease
activity by patients with urticaria and their treating physicians.’
Patients with CSU were categorized into 3 groups based on their
UAS7 scores, modified according to Hawe et al'” (UAS7 0-6, mild;
7-15, moderate; 16-42, severe). Patients who were treated with
omalizumab were excluded from this study. Their past history was
obtained from medical interview. All study participants provided oral
consent for this study after verbal and written explanation. The
study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board

(Kobe University; No. 180186).

 

Basophil activation test

Whole blood (up to 2 mL) was taken from the patients with CSU,
mild-to-moderate AD, and HCs using ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) containing blood collection tubes and assays were performed. within 24 hours of blood sampling. The Allergenicity Kit
(Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif) was modified and used for the
quantification of basophil CD203c expression.”” Basophils were
stimulated with anti-IgE antibody (clone: E124-2-8D) (10 [g/mL)
from the Allergenicity kit as a positive control, VioBlue conjugated
anti-IgE antibody (clone: MB10-5C4) (110 [lg/mL) (Miltenyi Biotec,
Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), or biotinylated anti-FceRI antibody
(clone: CRA1 or CRA2) (1.6 and 0.9 mg/mL, respectively) (BioAcademia, Osaka, Japan). The CRA1 antibody binds FceRI even in
the presence of IgE, whereas the CRA2 antibody reacts with the
FceRI& subunit at a region that overlaps with the IgE binding site;
thus it competes with IgE for receptor binding.”' Basophils incubate
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were used as a negative control.

Briefly, 50 UL of fresh EDTA blood was incubated with 10 [tL of
staining reagent consisting of CRTH2-FITC, CD203c-PE, and
CD3-PC7 in activation buffer and mixed with the respective stimulant or PBS at 37°C for 15 minutes. The biotinylated antibodies
against CRAI or CRA2 were then coupled with APC streptavidin
(BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) at 4°C for 30 minutes. Afterward, blood
samples were depleted of erythrocytes by incubation in fixative and
lysis buffer for more than 10 minutes and centrifuged at 200 x g for

 

 

5 minutes and supernatant aspirated. Next, leukocytes were washe
in 1500 UL of PBS. Finally, cells were resuspended in 0.3 mL PBS
0.1% formaldehyde and evaluated by flow cytometry (FACS verse;
BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif).

Flow cytometry results were analyzed by FlowJo software
(FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, Ore). Basophils were identified by their

characteristic forward and side scatter, expression of basophil acti
 

 

vation markers, and the absence of CD3 (Figure E1, available in this
article’s Online Repository at www. jaci-inpractice.org). The doublegated cells were analyzed on the CRTH/CD203c plot as basophils.

determined using a threshold defined as the expression level above
which only 5% of basophils in the negative control sample fluoresce,
on average.” Moreover, patients with CSU were defined as nonresponders when less than 10% of basophils were CD203c!®" basophils after anti-IgE antibody (clone: E124-2-8D) stimulation, and
as responders when more than 10% were.

Measurement of IgE and FceRI levels on basophils
Basophils were incubated with a VioBlue conjugated anti-IgE
antibody (clone: MB10-5C4) (Miltenyi Biotec) and biotinylated
anti-FceRI antibody (clone: CRAI1 or CRA2) (BioAcademia) and
analyzed by flow cytometry. The method of observing IgE and FceRI
levels on basophils and FlowJo analysis was the same as for the basophil
activation test after anti-lgE, CRA] or CRA2 antibody stimulation.
IgE and FceRI levels were evaluated as the mean fluorescence intensity.

Autologous serum skin test

The ASST was performed according to established methods.”
The diameters of wheals and erythema were measured after 15
minutes. Reactions were assessed as positive if the diameter of the
wheal induced by serum was >6 mm.

Statistical analysis

The nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test and unpaired r test
were used to assess differences between patients with CSU and HCs
or patients with AD, or responders and nonresponders. The KruskalWallis result with the Dunn test was used for comparing 3 or 4
groups of nonparametric variables. To assess correlations between 2
factors, adjusted r, (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient) values
were calculated. All statistical analyses were carried out using
GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif). Two
sided P values of <.05 were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Study population

The characteristics of patients with CSU are described in
Table I. Thirty-eight patients with CSU (14 male and 24 female
patients) were enrolled in the study. The mean age was 46.3 +
16.2 years and the median duration of disease was 4.0 years.
Median serum total IgE was 139.5 IU/mL. The ASST was
performed in 17 patients, with the result being positive in 41.1%
(7 of 17). Only 1 patient had concomitant angioedema.

In this study, the patients with CSU were categorized into 3
subgroups based on the severity of disease according to the
UAS7. The characteristics of these subgroups are described in
Table Il. Importantly, they exhibited no significant differences
regarding sex, age, serum total IgE, and disease duration. In
addition, it was observed that the median value of total serum
IgE levels in the severe group was lowest. However, this was only
a tendency, with no statistically significant value.

 

Measurement of CD203c expression after FceRI
stimulation on basophils in patients with CSU

First, we analyzed the expression of the activation marker
CD203c with or without anti-[gE and/or FceRI stimulation in
patients with CSU, patients with AD, and HCs to examine
basophil reactivity via FceRI. Unlike previous reports,® the
expression of CD203c on peripheral blood basophils in patients
with CSU in the steady state without anti-IgE and/or FceRI
stimulation was equivalent to HCs (Figure E2, available in this
article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org). When
peripheral blood basophils were stimulated with anti-IgE (E124

basophils of almost all HCs (labeled CD203ch8 basophils).
Notably, the percentage of CD203chi# basophils was significantly lower in patients with CSU than in HCs (Figure 1, A and
B). In addition, basophils from patients with CSU showed
attenuated upregulation of CD203c after anti-FceRI (CRA1)
stimulation compared with basophils from HCs (Figure 1, C). In
contrast, anti-FceRI (CRA2) stimulation scarcely upregulated
CD203c in either patients with CSU or HCs (Figure 1, D).
CRAI antibody binds FceRI even in the presence of IgE,
whereas the CRA2 antibody reacts with the FceRI@, subunit at a
region that overlaps with the IgE binding site. Basophils in
almost all patients with CSU who showed upregulation of
CD203c after anti-IgE (E124-2-8D) were also activated by both
another anti-IgE clone (MB10-5C4) and anti-FceRI (CRA1)
stimulation (Table El, available in this article’s Online Re.

after anti-IgE (E124-2-8D) were not activated by these 2 othe
antibodies (Table E1). Upregulation of CD203c against 2 kin

low responsiveness on basophils in many patients with CSU, bui
not HCs, could be observed in parallel after stimulation with

reactivity in patients with CSU is dysregulated. Interestingly, the
proportion of CD203chi8* basophils after anti-IgE (E124-2-8D,
MB10-5C4) stimulation was also significantly lower in patients
with CSU than in patients with AD (Figure 1, A and B). When

was significantly lower in severe group than in HCs when
stimulated with anti-IgE (E124-2-8D, MB-105C4), whereas
there was no significant difference between moderate/mild group
and HCs (Figure 2, A and B). In contrast, only a trend was
observed when stimulated with anti-FceRI (CRA1) (Figure 2,

anti-IgE antibody (E124-2-8D) stimulation showed a weak
negative correlation (Figure E3, available in this article’s Online
Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org). Collectively, attenuated
CD203c expression on basophils after stimulation via FceRI was
a characteristic phenomenon in patients with severe CSU when
compared with HCs and patients with AD.

To further define the attenuated CD203c expression on basophils by phenotype, we performed analysis segregated based on
the different treatment groups and according to history of
symptoms. Although we classified patients with CSU into 2

 

groups according to whether they took conventional or high
doses of H1 antihistamines, there was no difference between
these 2 groups (data not shown). Moreover, we classified patients
with CSU into 2 groups according to whether they had allergic
past history (asthma, allergic rhinitis, AD, and pollinosis) and
analyzed basophil reactivity respectively. However, there was no
difference between these 2 groups (data not shown).

In addition, although we examined the correlations between
serum tryptase levels and CD203c reactivity with or without
stimulation, all parameters were not correlated (Figure E4, available in this article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org).

Because activation of basophils, including upregulation of
CD203c, is triggered by cross-linking of IgE and FceRI on basophils, we next examined FceRI and IgE levels on basophils in patients with CSU and HCs. The FceRI (CRA1) expression on
basophils was significantly higher in patients with CSU compared
with HCs (Figure 3, B), whereas there were no significant differences in the levels of cell-bound IgE and FceRI (CRA2) (Figure 3,
A and C). These data revealed that total FceRI expression, but
not the level of IgE binding on basophils, was increased in patients
with CSU.

Furthermore, we studied the relationship between the levels of
basophil-bound IgE, FceRI expression, and the severity of CSU.
CRAI expression on basophils was statistically slightly higher in
the moderate group, but not mild or severe groups, compared
with HCs (Figure 4, B). There were no significant differences in
IgE and CRA2 levels on basophils between these 4 groups
(Figure 4, A and C). There was also no difference in serum total
IgE levels among the groups based on the severity of CSU
(Table II). These data indicate that serum total IgE levels,
basophil-bound IgE, and FceRI expression in patients with CSU
are not closely linked with the severity of CSU.

Previous studies reported that basophil surface IgE density and
FceRI expression are correlated with serum IgE levels in nonallergic subjects, allergic asthma, AD, _ hypereosinophilic

 

 

syndromes, hyper-IgE syndrome, helminth infestation, and IgE
myeloma.”’ We investigated the relationship between serum IgE
levels and IgE, CRA1 or CRA2 levels on basophils in patients
with CSU. Similar to other disorders, serum IgE levels were
strongly correlated with IgE or CRA1 expression on basophils
(Figure E5, A and B, available in this article’s Online Repository
at www.jaci-inpractice.org), but uncorrelated with CRA2
expression (Figure E5, C, available in this article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org).

In addition, we examined the correlations between serum
tryptase levels and IgE or FceRI expression on basophils.
Although serum tryptase levels were negatively correlated with
IgE expression on basophils (7, = —0.57, P = .01) (Figure E6, A,
available in this article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.
org), FeeRI expressions on basophils were not correlated
(Figure E6, Band C, available in this article’s Online Repository at

www.jaci-inpractice.org).

 

 

IgE and FceRI levels on basophils in patients with
CSU were not strongly correlated with CD203c

Because activation of basophils is induced by cross-linking of

levels and CD203c expression after anti-IgE and anti-FceRI
stimulation in patients with CSU. The IgE and CRA expression
on basophils in patients with CSU had a weak positive correlation with CD203c expression after anti-IgE and anti-FceRI
(Figures E7 and E8, available in this article’s Online Repository
at www.jaci-inpractice.org). More interestingly, focusing on
Figures 1, C, and 3, B, although FceRI expression on basophils
was significantly higher in patients with CSU than HCs, the
response to anti-FceRI stimulation was significantly attenuated
in patients with CSU compared with HCs. These data indicate
that the intensity of IgE and/or FceRI expression on basophils in
patients with CSU is not directly linked with CD203c responsiveness of basophils via FceRI in patients with CSU.

Classification of patients with CSU according to
basophil CD203c reactivity

Finally, we focused on the attenuated CD203c expression on
basophils that is characteristic of some patients with CSU and

conducted subgroup analysis. Patients with CSU could be
classified into 2 groups based on whether basophil CD203c
expression was close to that of activated HCs (proportion
CD203ch8" basophils after anti-IgE stimulation as noted in a
previous report:'” nonresponders [<10% CD203c8" basophil] and responders [>10% CD203chish basophil]). Interestingly, durations of disease were significantly shorter in
nonresponders to anti-IgE than in responders (Figure 5, A).
Proportion CD203ch8" basophils after anti-IgE stimulation
and disease duration showed a positive correlation (Figure 5,
D). No significant differences regarding age, sex ratio, ASST
positive rate, and serum total IgE levels were found between
the 2 groups (data not shown). The nonresponders had
significantly higher UAS7 scores and lower urticaria control test
scores than responders (Figure 5, B and C). Furthermore, the
nonresponders to anti-IgE exhibited significantly lower reactivity against the CRA antibody (Figure 6, A) and significantly
lower FceRI expression on basophils than the responders
(Figure 6, B). The subgroup characteristics of responders and
nonresponders to anti-IgE are summarized in Table E2

DISCUSSION

This study focused on the fluctuation of CD203c expression as. an
activation marker on basophils in CSU pathogenesis. Previous
studies have noted the unique features of peripheral blood basophils
in patients with CSU. Some reports documented that basophils in
patients with CSU have reduced histamine release in response to
anti-IgE or CD63 induction in response to anti-FceRI.'”'? In
contrast, other studies found that basophils of patients with CSU
exhibit high response to anti-IgE based on histamine release.”’'*
However, there is little research on basophils in patients with
CSU simultaneously comparing various stimuli via FceRI. Based on
this background, our study adopted examination methods using a
variety of FceRI stimuli (anti-IgE [E124-2-8D, MB-105C4], antiFceRI [CRA1, CRA2]). By using this technique, it was shown that
CD203c expression on basophils in patients with CSU was signif
icantly attenuated compared with HCs after stimulation with the 3
antibodies, that is, except for CRA2, which appears to have the
weakest stimulating ability on basophils. In addition, a low response

to these 3 antibodies was observed in basophils from many patients
with CSU (Table E1, available in this article’s Online Repository at
www. jaci-inpractice.org). These data emphasized that low responsiveness of basophils via FceRI is a distinctive phenomenon in patients with CSU. Moreover, we attempted to compare the basophil
responsiveness between patients with CSU and patients with AD.
Notably, basophil low responsiveness was not observed in patients
with mild-to-moderate AD, indicating that this phenomenon may
be specific to patients with CSU.

FceRI on mast cells is upregulated by IgE binding on mast
cells,“ and binding of monomeric IgE to FceRI, without crosslinking, potentiates the activity of mast cells in the absence of
degranulation.”’ It has been reported that serum total IgE is
elevated in patients with CSU.”’ These previous data lead us to
focus on the levels of IgE and FceRI on basophils of patients
with CSU. Consistent with previous studies,” '° the FceRI
(CRA1) expression on basophils was higher in patients with
CSU than HCs. The presence of IgE and interaction between
IgE and FceRI can also upregulate FceRI expression on basophils.*” Similarly, our study demonstrated that elevated serum
total IgE levels were correlated with FceRI (CRA1) expression
on basophils in patients with CSU, suggesting that the serum

monomeric IgE in patients with CSU induces upregulation of
FceRI expression on basophils (Figure E5, B, available in this
article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org).””
However, IgE or FceRI expression on basophils was not
strongly correlated with CD203c reactivity of basophils in
patients with CSU after stimulation via FceRI (Figures E7 and
E8, available in this article’s Online Repository at www.jaciinpractice.org). These data suggest the possibility that monomeric IgE has an effect including upregulation of FceRI, etc.,
on basophils in CSU, but that basophils in CSU are maintained without CD203c upregulation and/or activation, for
example, histamine release regardless of elevated FceRI
expression and are “primed” for augmented function to other
activators. However, further research is needed to prove this
hypothesis. Because previous studies show that pathways for
degranulation other than via FceRI appear not to be affected in
basophils of patients with CSU (N-formyl-met-leu-phe,
monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), this abnormal responsiveness of basophils in patients with CSU may be due to
elevated expression of intracellular phosphatases regulating the
FceRI signaling pathway.°°” Previous study reports elevated
SHIP-1 and SHIP-2 protein, negative regulatory phosphatases,
and a reduction in FceRI-mediated phosphoAkt generation in
some CSU basophils.*”

EAACI/GA*LEN/EDF/WAO Guidelines recommend that
disease activity in CSU should be assessed and monitored both
in clinical care and trials with UAS7.' Patients with CSU can
be categorized into 3 groups (mild, moderate, and severe disease) based on their UAS7 scores. Subsequently, we assessed
the relationship between disease severity and various parameters
including CD203c responsiveness via FceRI and the expression
of IgE and FceRI on basophils in patients with CSU. Notably,
low responsiveness of CD203c on basophils after various
stimuli via FceRI was marked in patients with severe CSU
(Figure 2). In contrast, the expression of IgE and FceRI on
basophils in patients with CSU was not closely linked with
severity of CSU in patients. These observations revealed that

 

low responsiveness of basophils via FceRI, but not surface
markers on basophils, is associated with disease severity in
patients with CSU.

CSU can be characterized as a heterogeneous disease based on
activity, evolution, pathophysiological aspects, and response to
treatment. In this study, we attempted to classify patients with
CSU into subgroups based on low responsiveness of basophils.
Patients with CSU were classified into 2 groups based on
responsiveness of basophil CD203c express to anti-IgE stimulation (responders and nonresponders). Interestingly, clinical features of nonresponders exhibited shorter duration of disease but
severe disease activity, unlike a previous study.'? It is reported
that the mean disease duration of 117 patients with CSU not
controlled by a standard dose of antihistamine is 27.4 months.*'
In our study, the median disease duration of nonresponders and
responders to anti-IgE was 1.2 (0.2-8) years and 6 (1-33) years,
respectively. Therefore, we thought that a nonresponse to antiIgE is associated with shorted disease duration. In addition,
nonresponders to anti-IgE also showed nonresponsiveness to
anti-FceRI stimulation. Collectively, this subgroup analysis indicates that the subgroup of patients with CSU with severe
disease features low responsiveness of basophils via FceRI and is
relatively rapidly developing compared with nonsevere groups.
Moreover, this basophil abnormality seems to be correlated with
disease severity and disease duration of patients with CSU.

There are several limitations in this study, such as the pathophysiological mechanism regarding low responsiveness of
basophil CD203c to FceRI stimulation not being investigated in
detail. Furthermore, although patients with CSU treated with
omalizumab were excluded, other treatment of patients with
CSU was not uniform.

In conclusion, basophil low responsiveness via FceRI is a
characteristic phenomenon in patients with CSU and is associated with disease severity. In addition, the subgroup showing
attenuated basophil reactivity via FceRI reflects unique clinical
features of patients with CSU. It will be necessary in the future to
elucidate the mechanisms involved in the dysregulation of
