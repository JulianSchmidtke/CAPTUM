Summary

Background Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is a distressing skin condition involving
recurrent itchy hives lasting 6 weeks or longer. The mechanism involves mast cell and
basophil degranulation, which releases inflammatory mediators including histamine. In our
clinical practice, we have observed that the onset of CIU is often preceded by a major life
event.

Objective To investigate the role of the hormones of the hypothalamic—pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis in the link between psychological stress and CIU.

Methods Thirty people with CIU and 30 normal controls were recruited. A flow cytometric
CD63 expression assay was used to quantify basophil activation, and serum cortisol
concentrations were measured as an indication of stress.

Results Both corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)
were shown to activate basophils. There was no significant difference between numbers of
CIU patients and normal controls responding to CFR, ACTH or cortisol. However, the
responses in the CIU patients were stronger than those in normal controls. There was also a
trend towards higher serum cortisol concentrations in CIU patients. The basophil response to
CRF and ACTH correlated with the serum cortisol concentration in normal controls, but not in
CIU patients.

Conclusions Although our data have not supported the hypothesis that stress makes a major
contribution to CIU, the heightened basophil response to CFR and ACTH and higher levels of

Introduction

Chronic urticaria is a skin condition characterized by a
raised, itching weal-and-flare rash that appears with
varying frequency for at least 6 weeks and can occur for
many years [1-3]. It affects 0.5-1% of individuals at some
time in their lives [3]. The same mechanism is shared by
chronic urticaria and allergic reactions, namely the
degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which releases
mediators of inflammation, such as histamine. However,
unlike allergies, degranulation in chronic urticaria is not
initiated by an allergen interacting with IgE bound to cell
surface receptors. A proportion of cases of chronic urticaria are predominantly due to physical factors such as
delayed pressure, cold, heat, ete directly triggering mast
cell degranulation, and these are classified as physical

urticaria [3]. In another proportion of cases of chronic
urticaria, autoantibodies to the high-affinity IgE receptor
have been demonstrated [4] and these are now classified
as autoimmune urticaria [1]. Finally, the remaining
patients with chronic urticaria for which no cause can be
identified are classified as chronic idiopathic urticaria
(CIU) [3]. It is recognized that physical urticarias often
co-exist with CIU [1]. It has been suggested that autoimmune urticaria accounts for 30-50% of cases of chronic
urticaria, including many patients previously diagnosed
as CIU [5].

In our clinical allergy practice, we have made the
observation that a relatively large proportion of patients
with CIU give a history of a significant life event in
the period leading up to the commencement of the
symptoms and this has been confirmed by a recent study
Basophil function in chronic idiopathic urticaria 87

 

(C. M. Chung, C. Symons, J. Gilliam and E. R. Kaminski,
unpublished data). This is paralleled by the observation
that in our own practice, only a relatively small minority
(~5-10%) of patients with chronic urticaria have the
autoimmune variety, as diagnosed by the autologous skin
prick test or the presence of thyroid antibodies. A number
of previous studies have proposed a role for stress in CIU
[6-8].

The association with stress implicates the neuroendocrine system in the disease aetiology. Psychological stress
activates the hypothalamic-pituitary—adrenal (HPA) axis.
This hormone cascade includes corticotrophin-releasing
factor (CRF), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), and
cortisol. CRF has been associated with mast cell degranulation in rats [9], and the expression of the CRF receptor
has been detected in human skin [10], with higher levels
found in CIU patients [6].

The activation and degranulation of basophils can be
assessed using flow cytometric detection of surface CD63
expression. This flow cytometric assay has been used to
study the response of donor basophils to serum from CIU
patients to detect autoantibodies [11-13]. However, recent
work by Luquin et al. [14] suggests an intrinsic basophil
abnormality in CIU. In this study, the CD63 expression
assay was used to investigate whether the degranulation
of basophils in CIU results from an abnormal response to
the HPA axis hormones.

Patients and methods

Study subjects

[hirty consecutive patients diagnosed with CIU were
recruited from the routine allergy clinic at Derriford
Hospital, Plymouth. Four of these patients were on antihistamine treatment. Thirty normal volunteer controls
from the hospital laboratory staff were also recruited.
These volunteers had never suffered from any form of
urticaria, were not taking antihistamines and did not have
allergies requiring ongoing treatment or avoidance of
specific allergen triggers. All subjects gave written informed consent to take part in the study. All subjects were
aged 18-65 years to avoid any confounding effects caused
by the declining function of the immune system in old
age. All data were anonymized before analysis. This study
was approved by the South West Devon Research Ethics
Committee (reference: 06/Q2103/20).

 

 

 

Sample collection

Peripheral blood samples were taken by a trained phlebotomist. All samples were taken during the time of the
morning clinic (within 2.5 h) to minimize the effects of the
diurnal variation in the cortisol level.

Basophil activation test

The basophil activation test is based on flow cytometric
detection of CD63, which appears on the surface of
basophils during degranulation. Basophils are identified
by the presence of IgE bound to the cell surface via the
high-affinity IgE receptor. The basophil activation test
measures cell function, and hence all samples were
analysed within 24h of collection to minimize cell death
and degradation. The BASOTEST kit manufactured by
Orpegen (Heidelberg, Germany) was purchased from
Becton Dickinson (Oxford, UK). All reagents are kit
components unless stated otherwise. Preparations of CRF
(human/rat), ACTH (human) and cortisol (corticosterone)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, UK). The
peptide hormones, CRF and ACTH, were dissolved in
BASOTEST wash buffer at 5 and 10 pg/mL, respectively.
Cortisol was dissolved at 50yg/mL in 0.5% ethanol in
wash buffer due to its hydrophobic character. These
hormone concentrations are orders of magnitude higher
than physiological levels, but are based on the work of
Theoharides et al. [9] on the response of mast cells in rat
skin.
The manufacturer's instructions for the BASOTEST were
altered to assess the in vitro response of basophils to the
HPA-axis hormones. One hundred microlitres of heparinized whole blood was pre-incubated with 20 uL of IL-3containing buffer at 37°C for 10min. The stimulation
age involved addition of 100uL of test solution (hormone solution, wash buffer as negative control or 0.5%
ethanol in wash buffer) and incubation for 2h at 37 °C.
Alternatively, 100 uL of f-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP; 2 pm) was
added as a positive control stimulation and incubated for
20 min at 37 °C. Degranulation was stopped by chilling on
ice for at least 5min. The cells were then labelled by
incubating for 20 min with a two-colour staining reagent
containing two monoclonal antibodies: phycoerythrinconjugated anti-IgE and anti-CD63 conjugated to fluoroisothiocyanate. This was carried out on ice to avoid the
anti-IgE activating the basophils by crosslinking IgE
bound to receptors on the cell surface. The erythrocytes
were lysed and the leucocytes were simultaneously fixed
by the addition of lysing solution and incubation at room
temperature for 10 min. Finally, the cells were washed and
resuspended in ice-cold wash solution. They were kept on
ice and analysed within 2h. Data on approximately 1000
surface IgE-positive cells were acquired on a FACS calibur
flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson), and the percentage
expressing surface CD63 was calculated.

stimulation test. Twenty microlitres of BASOTEST twocolour staining reagent was added and incubated on ice
for 20min to label the baseline CD63 without prior
exposure to IL-3 buffer or incubation at 37 °C. The rest of
the procedure was identical to that described for the
basophil activation test.

Quantitation of serum cortisol

Serum cortisol concentration was measured by the
Clinical Chemistry department using the routine immunoassay method on a DPC Immulite 2000 analyser.

Statistical analysis

The differences between percentages were tested by calculating the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of proportion.
Any overlap of the 95% Cls indicates that the percentages
are not significantly different. Using the negative control
to model on, the baseline basophil activation was tested
using Student’s t-test based on the mean and standard
deviation of the CD63 fluorescence of the IgE-positive
cells as given by the flow cytometer. Other analyses were
carried out using non-parametric tests: Mann-Whitney
U-test for hypothesis testing and Spearman’s ranked
correlation coefficient.

Results

Assay precision

To assess the variability of the basophil activation test
performance, the negative and positive controls were
tested in duplicate on three volunteer control samples.
The 95% CIs for the percentage of basophils expressing
CD63 overlapped in each pair, except the fMLP-positive
controls for volunteer 2 (Fig. 1). The overlap indicated that
there was no statistically significant difference between
the two results. The difference between the two results for
the positive control of volunteer 2 was statistically significant despite being the outcome of identical test conditions. The gap between the 95% CIs was small: only 0.4%.
This variability was considered when interpreting the
results of the basophil activation tests. The mean coefficient of variance for the negative controls was 16.17%
and 5.67% for the positive controls.

Using the negative control to model baseline basophil
activation

Baseline basophil activation, as indicated by CD63 expression, was assessed directly on eight samples: five CIU
patients and three volunteer controls. Comparison between the baseline activation and the negative control
showed no significant difference for six of the eight

samples (Table 1). One sample had a difference of only
1.32 fluorescence units, which was significant due to a
small standard deviation, but not clinically significant.
This left only one discrepant sample out of eight (12.5%;
95% Cl=— 10.4 to 35.4%). The negative control is therefore an acceptable model of baseline basophil activation.

Effects of antihistamine treatment on basophil response

Initially, CIU patients were recruited independently of
whether or not they were taking antihistamine treatment
for their condition. However, it was observed that basophils from patients on treatment had a different response
profile to the stimulation conditions (Fig. 2). They had an
elevated baseline activation as indicated by the negative
control. The positive control response was the same
irrespective of treatment. Only four patients on antihistamines were recruited, which accounts for the large standard errors of the means compared with the untreated
group. Nonetheless, it can be seen that the mean result for
those on antihistamines was high in response to all three
hormones compared with the untreated group, but consistent with the negative control. In order to avoid this
effect biasing the outcome of the study, all subsequent
patients were recruited at initial diagnosis before commencing treatment with antihistamines. The results from
the four patients taking antihistamines were excluded
from the analyses of the basophil activation test results.

for each sample. The positive control must be greater
than the negative control and there must be no overlap in
Cls in order for the test to be considered valid. This was
the case in all the samples, except one, which was from a
CIU patient. This sample was excluded from subsequent
analyses of basophil activation test results because
the test was deemed to have failed. While performing
these analyses, it was observed that one volunteer control
gave extreme responses to all stimulation conditions. It
was decided to exclude these data as well, in order to
avoid outlier effects on the statistical tests, although
diagnosing their condition was beyond the scope of this
study.

There was very little variation in the baseline basophil
activation. No difference was found in the baseline
expression of CD63 between the CIU patients and volunteer controls using a Mann-Whitney test to compare the
median fluorescence intensity of the negative controls in
each group (P=0.904) (Fig. 3). There was a trend towards
higher serum cortisol concentrations in the CIU patients
compared with the volunteer controls (Fig. 4). However,
using a Mann-Whitney test, this difference was not
statistically significant (P=0.071). There was no relationship between serum cortisol concentration and baseline
basophil activation (p=0.008, P=0.960) and a wide
variation in the serum cortisol concentrations, ranging
from 111 to 897 nmol/L.

Basophil responses to stress hormones of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis

The results of the basophil activation test using the
hormones of the HPA axis as stimulation are summarized
in Fig. 5. The data were analysed in the same way as for
the assay precision study. The number of cells collected for
each test was used to calculate the 95% CIs of the
percentage of basophils expressing CD63. If the 95% CI
for the response to a hormone did not overlap with the
95% CI for the negative control, the basophils from that
individual were deemed to have responded to the hormone. Based on the assay precision study, any sample
with a gap between the 95% CIs of <0.4% was not
classified as a responder.

There were a few significant responses to CRF in both
the CIU patient group and the volunteer control group.
Four of the 22 CIU patients in the analysis (18.2%; 95%
CI = 2.1-34.3%) responded, with a mean increase in the
percentage of basophils expressing CD63 of 34.2%
(95% CI =31.3-37.1%). Six of the 27 volunteer controls
(22.2%; 95% CIl=6.5-37.9%) responded, with a mean
increase in basophils expressing CD63 of 11.1% (95%
CI =9.2-13.0%). There were five significant responses to
ACTH in basophils from 20 CIU patients (25%; 95%
CI =6.0-44.0%) and nine from 27 volunteer controls
(33.3%; 95% CI = 15.5-51.1%). The mean increase in the
percentage of basophils expressing CD63 was 24.5%
(95% CI=21.8-27.2%) for the CIU patients and 10.8%
(95% CI = 8.9-12.7%) for the volunteer controls. Two CIU
patients responded to both CRF and ACTH. All six of the
volunteer controls who responded to CRF also responded
to ACTH.

In five of the 47 subjects (10.6%; 95% CI = 1.8-19.5%),
the percentage of basophils expressing CD63 decreased
following stimulation with cortisol. Three were volunteer
controls and two were CIU patients. The mean reduction
was 5.5% (95% CI = 4.1-6.9%). Three of these subjects also
showed reductions in the percentage of basophils expressing CD63 in response to the 0.5% ethanol control. In
total, six subjects had reduced basophil activation in
response to the ethanol control. The ethanol solvent may
therefore also have been a factor in the suppression of
basophil activation in the tests stimulated with cortisol.

The basophil response to stimulation with the peptide
hormones was calculated as the percentage of basophils
expressing CD63 in response to CRF or ACTH minus the
percentage in the negative control. The response to
cortisol was calculated by subtracting from the negative
control. These differences were then compared between
CIU patients and volunteer controls using Mann-Whitney

tests. No statistically significant differences were found
between the responses to CRF (P=0.817), ACTH
(P= 0.540) or cortisol (P= 0.606).

Correlation of basophil activation with serum cortisol
concentration

The responses to CRF and ACTH were calculated as the
difference between the percentage of basophils expressing
CD63 in the stimulated test and in the negative control.
The relationship between these differences and the serum
cortisol concentration was then explored using a Spearman’s correlation coefficient. In the volunteer controls,
the in vitro responses to both CRF and ACTH correlated
with the serum cortisol concentration (p=0.432,
P=0.024; and p=0.432, P=0.025, respectively). However, in the CIU patients this correlation was lost for both
CRE (p = 0.010, P= 0.968) and ACTH (p = 0.270, P= 0.295).

Discussion

There is evidence that CIU may be associated with psychological stress [6-8]. This is proposed to be a two-way
interaction, chronic skin diseases are known to heighten
psychological distress [15], while chronic stress may be a
trigger of CIU [3, 8]. In this study, a basophil activation
test was used to look at whether an abnormal basophil
response to the hormones of the HPA axis is involved in
the mechanism of this link.

The comparison of baseline basophil activation between CIU patients and volunteer controls showed no
difference in baseline CD63 expression. This is surprising,
because basophils are thought to be involved in mediating
the disease [16] and CD63 is a marker of basophil activation; it would therefore be expected that the basophils
would be more active in patients with CIU. Therefore, the
assumptions must be called into question. One possibility
is that basophils are not involved in the disease process,
which is entirely mediated by mast cells, or that basophils
have to be recruited to the skin before they are activated as
is the case for neutrophils in contact hypersensitivity [17].
Another is that CD63 expression may not be a good
marker of activation for basophils in this disease. CD63
appears on the surface of basophils during degranulation
and has previously been shown to be correlated with
histamine release [18]. Perhaps the role of basophils in
CIU is independent of their degranulation response. For
example, human mast cells and basophils are a major
source of cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-5 [19], which
could contribute to the inflammatory skin lesions.

Measuring serum cortisol as a surrogate marker of
chronic stress found a trend towards higher serum cortisol
concentrations in CIU patients. Measuring the cortisol
concentration in a 24-h collection of urine would have
given a more accurate indication of chronic stress and

may therefore have shown a more significant difference
between the two groups. If CIU patients were found to
have higher cortisol production that normal controls, this
would be contrary to findings in atopic dermatitis where a
blunting of the diurnal rhythm of cortisol production and
a decreased cortisol response to acute stress are observed
and implicated in the disease mechanism [20, 21].

The main purpose of the study was to investigate the
response of basophils to the hormones of the HPA axis in
order to determine their role in CIU. There were subjects in
both the CIU patient group and the volunteer control
group whose basophils responded to CRF and/or ACTH.
Therefore, this response is not diagnostic of CIU. However,
it does suggest that basophils are sensitive to activation by
these peptide hormones. Roughly the same proportion of
subjects responded to CRF or ACTH in the CIU patients and
the volunteer control groups. It would be interesting to
test whether the presence of autoantibodies affected the
basophil responses. The responses were stronger in the CIU
patients, resulting in a higher percentage of basophils
expressing CD63. Therefore, basophils from CIU patients
may be hyperresponsive rather than hypersensitive.

The final hormone of the HPA axis is cortisol. Corticosteroids are known to suppress cytotoxic T cell immunity
and the results suggest a mild suppressive effect on
basophil activation. When CIU patients are treated with
corticosteroids, it may therefore not only reduce the
inflammation but may also modulate the mechanism of
the disease.

The working hypothesis of this study was that basophils
from patients with CIU would have a lower threshold for
activation by hormones of the HPA axis than basophils
from normal controls. This was not shown to be the case,
as no significant difference in basophil responses was
found to any of the hormones tested. There is, however, a
correlation between basophil responses to CRF or ACTH
and serum cortisol concentration in volunteer controls
that is lost in CIU patients. This derangement of basophil
function is consistent with the basophil abnormality
reported by Luquin et al. [14] in CIU patients. In conclusion, our data do not substantiate a major contribution of
the hormones of the HPA axis to CIU.
