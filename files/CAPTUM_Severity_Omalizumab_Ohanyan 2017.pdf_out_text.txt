To the Editor:

Chronic urticaria, is a frequent skin disease characterized by the sudden appearance
of wheals, angioedema, or both for more than 6 weeks.’ It can be divided into chronic
spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and chronic inducible urticaria.! Many affected patients

t? > and the disease

do not respond sufficiently to first and second line treatmen
activity may also change considerably over time.* Therefore, most patients and their
physicians have to repeatedly decide if the current treatment is sufficient or if an
adjustment is needed. Moreover, the costs of the guideline-recommended therapies'
increase with each level, and three out of the five treatment options are off-label (only
H,-antihistamines in regular doses and omalizumab are currently licensed for CSU).
Accordingly, a regular and standardized evaluation of disease control during the
course of disease may help to guide treatment decisions, to back these decisions
with a valid and reliable documentation, and to monitor treatment outcome. To enable
this evaluation and documentation, we recently developed the Urticaria Control Test
(UCT).4 However, the UCT’s responsiveness to changes in disease control, for
example in response to treatment adjustment, as well as UCT score changes that
can be considered clinically relevant, have not yet been sufficiently studied. To
address these gaps, we here investigated the responsiveness of the UCT and its
minimal important difference (MID).

We investigated 65 consecutive adult patients with difficult-to-treat CSU, i.e. patients
with insufficient responses to regular and increased doses of second-generation H,antihistamines. After an initial assessment of patient characteristics (see Table E1
and Table E2 in this article’s Online Repository), all patients were asked to continue
their current treatment (second-generation H1-antihistamines in up to four times the
licensed dose) for 2 more weeks and to prospectively document their disease activity
with the Urticaria Activity Score (UAS). At the end of the 2 weeks (baseline), the
patients completed the UCT, the Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire (CUQ20L), the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and they answered additional
questions addressing the efficacy of their treatment and their current level of disease
control (for details on the outcome tools and the handling of missing values see the
Methods section in this article’s Online Repository). Subsequently, all patients
received their first injection of omalizumab 300 mg and were asked to document their
symptoms for another 4 weeks with the UAS. At the end of the 4 weeks (follow up),

all patients were asked to complete the UCT, CUQ20L, and DLQI as well as the

additional questions for a second time. In addition, the treating physicians rated the
response to treatment with omalizumab. After the first injection of omalizumab all
patients continued their treatment with H1-antihistamines in up to four times the
licensed dose, but were allowed to stop in case they reached complete symptom
control.

Four weeks after the initiation of omalizumab treatment, disease control, disease
activity and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) were improved as compared to
baseline (see Table E2 and Fig. E1 in this article’s Online Repository). UCT score
changes from baseline to follow up correlated strongly with changes of the UAS7 (r =
-0.63) and CU-Qz0L total score (r = -0.71), and showed a good correlation with
changes in DLQI scores (r = -0.49) (see Table 1a and Fig. E2 in this article’s Online
Repository). Moreover, the UCT results also strongly correlated with changes in the
patients’ self-evaluation of their treatment efficacy and with the physicians’ global
assessment of the treatment response (see Table E3 and Table E4 in this article’s
Online Repository). When treatment responses were categorized by changes in the
UAS7, the current gold standard of disease activity assessment in CSU, 77% of
‘complete responders’ were found to change from a UCT score of <12 points
(indicating poorly controlled disease) at baseline to 212 points (indicating wellcontrolled disease) during omalizumab therapy. In contrast, this was only the case in
20% of ‘partial responders’ and none of the ‘non-responders’ (Table 1b).

The MID is the smallest change in a score that can be considered clinically relevant.
In order to determine the UCT’s MID, anchor-based and distribution-criterion-based
approaches were applied. During the anchor-based approaches, the patient’s global
rating of their disease control (PatGA-disease control) was used as anchor. As
expected, UCT scores were found to be increased with an improved PatGA-disease
control at follow up (see Fig. E3 in this articles Online Repository) and the correlation
between changes in both outcome measures was strong (r = 0.84, p<0.001, n=61),
confirming that PatGA-disease control is an adequate anchor. The mean UCT score
increase (SD) in case of the smallest possible improvement in the PatGA-disease
control (improvements by one step on its Likert scale rating) was found to be 4.0 (SD
2.6) points. In contrast, in case of an unchanged PatGA-disease control rating, the
mean UCT score changed only by 1.3 (SD 1.9) points. Accordingly, the mean change
method® © suggests a MID of 4 points.

As second anchor-based method, a ROC curve analysis’ was applied (see Fig. E4
in this article’s Online Repository). Here, the cut-off point for UCT score changes with
the best balance of sensitivity and specificity for a meaningful improvement of
disease control was found to be 3 points. In addition, at this cut-off point, the sum of
the percentage of misclassified patients was lowest (Table 2). Accordingly, the ROC
curve analysis suggests a MID of 3 points.

For the distributional-criterion approach, the SD of the baseline UCT scores (3.2) was
divided by two. ® Accordingly, a MID of 1.6 (2 points) is suggested by this (indirect)
calculation.

In addition to the MID, the smallest detectable change of the UCT score was
calculated. For more information see the Results section in this article’s Online
Repository.

The UCT is a simple, valid and reliable PRO measure that was originally developed
to determine disease control in CU patients and to guide treatment decisions.* Here
we report, that the UCT is also suited to determine changes in disease control over
time and to assess treatment effects (that it is responsive to change). Our results
demonstrate that changes in the UCT score strongly correlate with disease-specific
assessments of changes in urticaria activity (UAS7) and HR-QoL (CU-Qz20L), while
the correlation with changes in the less-specific DLQI are less strong (but still good).
Importantly, the change of UCT ratings from ‘poorly controlled’ to ‘well-controlled’,
was well in accordance with the change of the patients’ self-assessment of treatment
efficacy, with the physicians’ global assessment of the treatment response, and with
the UAS7-based assessment of treatment response. This supports the
appropriateness of the current UCT cut-off value of 212 points to detect patients with
well-controlled urticaria.

The knowledge of the MID of an outcome measure is important for the interpretation
of changes in its score.° By applying two anchor-based approaches, the ‘mean
change method’ and the ROC curve analysis, we found a MID for UCT score
improvements of 4 and 3 points, respectively. The distribution-criterion based
analysis suggested a MID of 2 points. In line with other authors, '° we prefer the direct
and patient anchor-based approach over the indirect distributional-criterion approach.
Moreover, we prefer the results from the ROC curve analysis over the ‘mean change
method’ results, as the ROC curve analysis also includes subjects who did not

improve in their disease control. Accordingly, we regard a MID of 3 points as most
161 appropriate for UCT score changes. Supplemental discussion of this study including
162 its limitations are provided in the Discussion section in this article’s Online
163 Repository.

164 In conclusion, the UCT is a suitable tool for assessing levels and changes of disease
165 control in patients with chronic urticaria. The minimal important difference of the UCT,
166 i.e. the minimal score change that mirrors a clinically relevant change of disease

167 control for the individual patient, was found to be 3 points.

Methods

Patient population

In this study, we recruited 65 consecutive adult patients with difficult-to-treat CSU, i.e.
patients with insufficient responses to regular and increased doses of secondgeneration H,-antihistamines, who presented to the urticaria specialty clinic of the
Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Charité -— Universitatsmedizin Berlin
between March 2014 and July 2015 for the initiation of omalizumab therapy (Table
E1). Our study population included CSU patients who also suffered from ClndU, but
patients were excluded if ClndU was predominant. The study was approved by the
responsible ethics committee of the Charité -—  Universitatsmedizin Berlin
(EA1/178/16).

Outcome tools

Urticaria Control Test

 

The UCT assesses the level of disease control in chronic urticaria patients during the
last 4 weeks.’ It consists of four questions with 5 answer options each that are
scored from 0 to 4. The UCT score is the sum of all four questions with a lowest and
highest possible value of 0 (no control) and 16 (complete control), respectively. A
score 212 indicates well-controlled urticaria, while a score of $11 points towards poor

disease control.’ None of the included UCT scores had missing items.

Urticaria Activity Score:

 

The UAS is the current gold standard to measure disease activity in CSU patients.2“
It is a simple scoring system based on the prospective, once-daily assessment of itch
intensity and numbers of wheals on 4-point scales scored from 0 to 3 over a period of
7 days (UAS7).? Accordingly, the minimum and maximum UAS7 score is 0 and 42,
respectively. The UAS7 was calculated for the last 7 days of the baseline and the
follow up period. In case <2 days of UAS7 documentation were missing, the missing
daily scores were replaced by the mean daily scores of the remaining, available days

of that week (in total, 13 daily scores were replaced in 10 patients in the baseline
phase and 5 daily scores in 3 patients during the follow up phase). When >2 days
were missing, the data were excluded from the analyses (data from 9 patients in the

baseline phase and from 15 patients in the follow up phase).

Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire

 

The CU-Qz2oL is the first and currently only disease-specific health-related quality of
life (HR-QoL) questionnaire for CSU patients.*’ It contains 23 questions and has a
recall period of 2 weeks. All questions have 5 answer options that are scored from 0
to 4. After summing up all available question scores, these are divided by the
maximum possible score in that patient (depending on the number of questions
answered by that patient) and subsequently multiplicated by 100. By applying this
method, the total score is transferred to a 0-100 scale, which is done to limit the
influence of missing items on the total score. Higher CU-Q.0L total score values
indicate a higher HR-QoL impairment. The CU-Qz0L total score was not calculated in
case >5 items within the questionnaire were left unanswered, which was the case in
one patient at baseline and in three patients at follow up. In total, only 109 of 2.990

CU-Qz0L items were missing (3.6%).

Dermatology Life Quality Index

 

The DLQI is the most widely used HR-QoL measure for dermatological disorders
with a recall period of one week. It is a 10-item questionnaire that also has been
specifically validated for the use in CSU.° The minimum and maximum DLQI score is
0 and 30 points, respectively. Higher scores are indicative of a stronger HR-QoL
impairment. The DLQI score was not computed when >1 item was left unanswered,
which was the case in only one patient at baseline. In total, only 6 of 1.300 DLQI

items were missing (0.5%).

Patient’s Global Assessments

 

All patients were asked, at baseline and follow up, to globally self-rate a) if their
current CSU treatment during the past 4 weeks was ‘sufficient’ or ‘not sufficient’
(PatGA-treatment) and b) how well their urticaria was overall under control during the
past 4 weeks on a 5-point Likert scale with the answer options ‘not at all’, ‘hardly’,
‘fair, ‘well’, and ‘completely’ (PatGA-disease control). PatGA-treatment was missing

in 2 and 3 patients at baseline and follow up, respectively. PatGA-disease control
was missing in 4 and 0 patients at baseline and follow up, respectively. Missing

values were not replaced.

Physician’s Global Assessment of treatment response

 

The treating physicians were asked at follow up to globally rate the patients’
response to omalizumab on a 3-point scale (PhyGA-treatment response) with the
answer options ‘no response’ ($30% improvement), ‘partial response’ (>30% but
<90% improvement), and ‘complete’ response (>90% improvement). PhyGA
treatment response was missing in one patient and was not replaced.

Data Analysis

Responsiveness

To assess the UCT’s responsivness, we computed the mean values of the UCT
score, the UAS7, the CU-Q:oL total score, and the DLQI score at baseline and follow
up as well as the mean changes of these values. The mean scores were expected to
markedly improve in all scores, i.e. to increase in case of the UCT and to decrease in
case of the other instruments’ scores, since omalizumab has been demonstrated to
be an efficacious treatment in CSU in several randomized controlled trials.'°"®
Subsequently, we computed the correlations between the UCT score changes and
the respective changes in the other scores (Pearson correlation). Our interpretation
of the correlation coefficients was as follows: r~0.3 weak correlation, r~0.5 good
correlation, r~0.7 strong correlation. The UCT score changes were hypothesized to
show at least good correlation with the changes of the UAS7, the CU-Q,oL total
score, and the DLQI score. In addition, the UCT score changes were expected to
show a higher correlation with the score changes of the two disease-specific
measures UAS7 and CU-Q20L as compared to the less specific DLQI.

In addition, we related the UCT scores and their changes to a) the PatGA-treatment,
b) the PhyGA-treatment response, as well as c) the treatment response based on the
UAS7 development from baseline to follow up. To this end, we first dichotomized the
UCT results of the patients, based on the established cut-off value of 12 points’ into
patients with ‘poorly controlled’ disease and patients with ‘well-controlled’ urticaria.
Subsequently, we computed the proportions of patients with ‘poorly controlled’
urticaria and ‘well-controlled’ urticaria who a) rated their treatment as ‘sufficient’ or

‘not sufficient’ (PatGA-treatment), who b) were evaluated by the treating physicians
(PhyGA-treatment response) as ‘non responders’, ‘partial responders’ or ‘complete
responders’, and who c) were ‘non-responders’ ($30% improvement of the UAS7),
‘partial responders’ (>30% improvement of the UAS7 without achievement of UAS7
<6), and ‘complete responders’ (UAS7S6) based on UAS7 changes from baseline to

follow up.

Responsiveness and Minimal Important Difference

 

Responsiveness is defined as the ability of an instrument to detect changes over time
in the construct to be measured."” It is commonly reported through the minimal
important difference (MID), also known as minimal important change. A change equal
to or higher than the MID can be considered clinically relevant.

In order to determine the MID of the UCT we applied two anchor-based approaches,
a) the mean change method'® '® and b) receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve analysis.”° For both analyses, the PatGA-disease control was used as external
anchor. The mean change method was applied by computing the mean changes of
UCT scores from baseline to follow up in patients exhibiting different PatGA-disease
control ratings at these assessments. The MID in this approach is defined as the
mean UCT score improvement in patients with a minimal but still perceivable change,
i.e. patients with a one-step improvement in their PatGA-disease control rating from
baseline to follow up.

For the ROC curve analysis, patients were dichotomized into subjects with ‘improved’
disease control (defined as at least one step improvement in their PatGA-disease
control rating from baseline to follow up) and ‘not improved’ disease control (defined
as an unchanged or worsened PatGA-disease control rating). Subsequently, the
sensitivity and specificity of each possible cut-off point for UCT score changes
indicating ‘improved disease control’ was computed. In addition, the sum of the
percentage of misclassified patients was recorded. Before the ROC curve analysis
was performed, we had defined that the correlation between the anchor (PatGAdisease control changes) and the UCT score changes should be at least good (r~0.5)
in order to ensure the suitability of the anchor.

As an alternative, indirect method to determine the MID, we applied a distributionalcriterion approach. In this approach, the baseline UCT’s SD is divided by two, based
on reports that one-half of the SD of a PRO measure’s mean baseline score is a

good approximation of the MID.”'
Smallest Detectable Change

 

The smallest detectable change (SDC) is the smallest change that can be considered
a ‘real’ change with a 95% confidence." It is the smallest detectable change of a
PRO tool’s score beyond the measurement error. The SDC is defined as 1.96 times
the SD of the PROs score changes” between two independent assessments in
stable, unchanged patients. Subjects with an identical PatGA-disease control rating
at baseline and follow up were included for this analysis.

Since the proportion of stable patients was rather small in the population studied, we
decided to additionally determine the SDC in the population from the original UCT
publication’ independently to ensure that the SDC results are accurate. Thirty-three
patients were included because they exhibited an unchanged disease severity at two
independent UCT assessments 4 weeks apart. These patients (22 females, 11
males) had a mean age (SD) of 47.4 (SD 16.5) years and a mean disease duration
(SD) of 111.3 (SD 149.4) months. In this population neither a defined intervention nor

resistance to H1-antihistamines was a prerequisite for inclusion.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were done using SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics Version 22, IBM
Corporation, Armonk, New York, USA). ps0.05 was considered as statistically

significant.

Results

Additional data on the patient population

All included patients had antihistamine-refractory CSU. The majority (77%) was
female, and most subjects (82%) exhibited both, recurrent wheals and angioedema
(Table E1).

Additional results on the ability of the UCT to detect changes in response to
treatment

Four weeks after the initiation of omalizumab 300 mg treatment (follow up), the UCT
scores increased by 5.8 (SD 4.3) points, the UAS7 dropped by 12.4 (SD 12.4) points,
and the CU-Q2oL total scores and DLQI scores decreased by 19.2 (SD 15.1) and 7.5
(SD 7.5) points, respectively, as compared to baseline (mean individual changes,
Table E2).

The UCT results strongly correlated with changes in the patients’ self-evaluation of
their treatment efficacy (PatGA-treatment, Table E3): before initiation of omalizumab
61 out of 65 patients (94%) had a UCT score <12 points indicating ‘poorly controlled’
disease, while only 4 patients (6%) exhibited a UCT score 212 points, suggesting
‘well-controlled’ disease (Fig. E1). The majority of patients (90%) with ‘poorly
controlled disease’ at baseline (UCT score <12 points) also reported that their
treatment was not sufficient. Four weeks after the first administration of omalizumab,
the majority of patients (62%) exhibited a UCT score indicative of ‘well-controlled’
urticaria (UCT score 212 points) and 93% of them indicated that their treatment was
sufficient (Fig. E1, Table E3).

In addition, the UCT results also correlated with the physicians global assessment of
the patients treatment response: four weeks after the first omalizumab administration,
the treating physicians rated 34 of 64 patients (53%) as ‘complete responders’, 19
patients (30%) as ‘partial responders’ and 11 patients (17%) as ‘non-responders’
(PhyGA-treatment response). While 88% of the ‘complete responders’ changed from
a UCT score of <12 points at baseline to 212 points during omalizumab treatment,
this was only the case in 17% of the ‘partial responders’ and 18% of the ‘non
responders’ (Table E4).

Additional results in the smallest detectable change (SDC) of the UCT score

In this study, 10 patients exhibited a stable, unchanged PatGA-disease control rating
at baseline and follow up. These patients had a mean change of their UCT score
(SD) of 1.3 (SD 1.9) points (median: 1.0). The UCT score changes followed a normal
distribution (p=0.13, Shapiro Wilk Test). Accordingly, the SDC of the UCT score is
3.7 points (1.96*SD). Only 2 patients (20%) exhibited an improvement of their UCT
score by 3 points or more, i.e. 80% are classified correctly as not meaningfully
improved when a MID of 3 points is applied.

In the independent patient sample from the original UCT publication’ 33 subjects
exhibited a stable disease status between two UCT assessments 4 weeks apart. The
mean difference (SD) between the first and the second UCT application was 0.5 (SD

1.9) points (median: 0). Accordingly, based on this population, the SDC of the UCT
score is 3.8 points. Only 5 patients with stable disease (15%) exhibited an
improvement of their UCT score by 3 points or more, i.e. 85% are classified correctly
as not meaningfully improved when a MID of 3 points is applied. Since the UCT score
changes did not fulfil the criteria for normal distribution in this patient sample
(p=0.018, Shapiro Wilk Test), we also investigated the performance of the calculated
SDC in this population. Notably, only 3 patients (9%) reported a UCT score change of
>3.8 points, suggesting the validity of the applied method of SDC calculation also in

this sample.

Discussion:

Levels of MID and SDC

As explained in the original article of this repository, we regard a MID of 3 points as
most appropriate for UCT score changes. With this MID, at least 80% of patients with
‘truly not improved’ disease control are correctly classified as not improved by the
UCT. Moreover, a definition of the UCT’s MID to be 4 instead of 3 points, at least in
our population, would go along with an unchanged specificity but a lower sensitivity
of identifying subjects with ‘truly improved’ urticaria control. The proportion of
misclassified patients would increase.

The SDC of the UCT was found to be 4 points in this study, i.e. the smallest change
of the UCT score beyond the measurement error. While the number of 10 patients for
the SDC calculation was small, and its result might therefore be questioned, we were
able to reproduce the same SDC value in a second, independent, and larger patient
population from the original UCT validation study.’ It may appear confusing that the
SDC with 4 points is slightly larger than the MID with 3 points. However, this is a wellknown phenomenon in clinimetrics. For most measurement instruments, the SDC is
greater than the MID.” A major reason for this is that the criterion for the SDC
computation (95% confidence) is very conservative, whereas the criteria for the MID

need to be less rigorous.

Study limitations
Limitations of this study include 1) that the patient sample consisted only of Hi
antihistamine-refractory and only of CSU patients, 2) that the data on the MID was
obtained in patients that received only one type of treatment adjustment, known to
have a large effect size, 3) that all patients were recruited in a specialized, tertiary
referral center, and 4) that all included subjects were adults. Accordingly, we cannot
fully exclude that the MID might be overestimated in this setting and that slightly
different results might be obtained in other populations, e.g. patients with less-severe
urticaria, patients with ClndU but not CSU, or children and adolescents. Further
limitations of this study are that the populations to determine the SDC, as mentioned
above, were small and that it may be questioned if the distributions of the UCT score
changes are normal enough for the SDC calculations. Although, the SDC results
were found to be similar in the two independent populations studied, the SDC of the

UCT remains to be confirmed in future studies.
