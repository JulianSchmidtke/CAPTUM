Introduction

Summary

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a disorder characterized by recurrent transient itchy
wheels of 6 weeks duration or longer. The cause cannot be pinpointed in about 40% of patients. To elucidate the possible association between CSU and hyperlipidemia, 40 CSU patients and 40 group matched healthy individuals were assessed for hyperlipidemia. Data on
history, urticaria activity score (UAS-7), physical examination and routine laboratory investigations including lipid profile (serum IL6 and TNF a) was recorded. Statistically significant
in-crease of serum cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL), IL6, TNFa
and decrease of high density lipoprotein (HDL) was found in CSU in comparison to control
group. Regarding the different disease variables, both TG and cholesterol were positively correlated with duration of illness, urticaria activity score and serum TNF a. Serum LDL detected significant positive correlation with duration of illness, urticaria score, CRP and TNF
a while serum HDL detected significant negative correlation with TNF a. IL6 and TNFa
associated systemic inflammation could be a common pathogenic mechanism of CSU and
hyperlipidemia. Patients with CSU should be evaluated for hyperlipidemia.

or unknown. Autoimmune mechanisms have been considered
in 30-50% of cases (3). The inducible urticaria has variable trig
Urticaria is described as wheals (swelling/erythema) and/or angioedema lasting for 1-24 hours. The European Academy of
Allergy and Clinical immunology (EAACI), the Global Allergy
and Asthma European Network (GA2LEN), the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) and the World Allergy Organization
(WAO) guidelines sorted urticaria according to the duration
and cause. Urticaria lasting more than 6 weeks is divided into
two categories; inducible or spontaneous urticaria (1,2).

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is stated as an immuno-inflammatory disorder characterized by the recurrent occurrence of wheals and/or angioedema lasting for more than 6

weeks (1). Causes of CSU may be known (e.g. autoantibodies)

gers (cold, delayed pressure, solar, heat, vibratory, cholinergic,
contact, and aquagenic) urticaria. More than one type of urticaria can coexist in the same patient (4). The natural course of CSU
is self-limiting, with spontaneous remissions and exacerbations,
however, impairment of the quality of life is usually severe (5).
Though the pathogenesis of CSU remains unknown, some
studies have revealed the existence of intrinsic abnormalities in
basophils or mast cells (6,7). Nonetheless, CSU inflammatory
processes are not restricted to the consequences of mast/basophil
degranulation (7). CSU is characterized by cutaneous mast cell
degranulation, in addition to infiltration of the skin by eosinophils, neutrophils and T lymphocytes (8).

Foregoing studies suggested that immunological malfunction
is the primary background in CSU. This is confirmed by the
dysfunctional innate immune response which was found in
CSU patients in the form of increased levels of C-reactive
protein (CRP), proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL-6), tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-a), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 with an altered pattern of regulatory cytokine
secretion (9). These inflammatory markers were noticed to
harmonize well with activity score of urticaria and its severity
(7,9,10).

Also, a systemic pro-inflammatory state marked by the elevation of serum level of inflammatory mediators as IL-6, TNF,
and CRP are detected in patients with metabolic syndrome
(obesity, dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, and plasma
glucose level). Dyslipidemia was incriminated to be involved
in the inflammatory mechanisms of atherosclerosis associated
with metabolic syndrome (11).

Consequently, both CSU and metabolic syndrome have been
characterized by systemic inflammation which was pinpointed
in various studies (12,13). Furthermore, a greater frequency of
metabolic syndrome was detected in patients with CSU compared to healthy controls (13). However, few studies have yet
specifically determined a link between hyperlipidemia and CSU.
Thus, the aim of the current study was to clarify the possible
association between hyperlipidemia and proinflammatory cytokines among chronic urticaria patients.

Methodology

Study participants

Forty patients with established diagnosis of chronic spontaneous urticaria according to standard European Academy
of Allergology and Clinical Immunology/the Global Allergy
and Asthma European Network (EAACI/GA2LEN) guidelines (2) were enrolled in the study. They were recruited from
the allergy clinic of Ain Shams University hospital during
the period from February 2015 to March 2017. The diagnosis of CSU was considered if the wheals last for 6 weeks
or longer at least 2 times a week and its underlying cause
remained unidentified notwithstanding the appropriate investigations with pseudoallergen-free diet for 3 weeks. No
one of the participants was smoker, body mass index more
than 25, had food/medication induced allergy including
NSAIDS hypersensitivity or autoimmune diseases including
thyroid autoimmune diseases, or urticarial vasculitis. Other
exclusion criteria were inducible urticarial lesions by chronic
infections, H pylori, environmental agents, stress or physical
agents as cholinergic stimulation, dermatographism or pressure. Another forty group-matched healthy individuals were
enrolled as a control group. The study was approved by the

allergy and clinical immunology review board and research
ethics committee of Ain Shams University. All participants
did sign an informed consent.

Study design

All participants were subjected to detailed history including
past and family history as well as urticaria activity score (UAS7) and complete clinical examination excluding the aforesaid
etiologies. The onset, duration, characteristics and distribution
of lesions, history of any associated medical illness or allergies,
drug history were recorded. Standard investigations were executed as skin test for allergy including physical tests, autologous serum skin test, urine analysis, stool analysis, Helicobacter
pylori antigen, liver enzymes, kidney function tests, complete
blood picture, thyroid antibodies, ESR, CRP, hepatitis C virus
antibody, hepatitis B virus surface antigen and human immunodeficiency virus antibodies.

Assessment of urticaria activity score

We assessed CSU disease activity using the weekly urticaria activity score (UAS-7). It is evaluated according to the number
of wheals and pruritus intensity assumed on the EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF guidelines. We asked the patients to record scores
of 24 hours self-evaluation for 7 days and documented it as: no
wheals = 0; < 20 wheals/24 hour = 1; 20-50 wheals/24 hour =
2; and > 50 wheals/24 hour = 3; and pruritus intensity: no =
0; mild = 1; moderate = 2; and severe = 3. The weekly UAS-7
(equal to the sum of the scores on 7 consecutive days) ranges

from (0-42) (2).
Skin Prick Test

We performed the skin prick test using the most conventional aeroallergen extracts. The result was interpreted after 15-20
minutes. It was considered justifiable when the difference in
mean wheal diameters was at least 1 mm between the histamine
(positive) and saline (negative) controls. Patient is considered
sensitized to that peculiar allergen when a wheal diameter is = 3
mm more than the negative control (14).

Autologous serum skin test

Participants stopped all medications containing antihistamines
and corticosteroids for at least 5 days before performance of the
test. We performed the test according to the EAACI/GA2LEN
task force consensus guidelines. The test is positive when a serum-induced wheal is at least 1.5 mm more than that induced
by saline after 30 minutes (15).

Anti-nuclear antibody, anti-thyroid antibodies and inflammatory
markers

Anti-nuclear antibody, anti-thyroglobulin, and thyroid microsomal antibodies were measured using indirect fluorescent antibody technique using (INOVA Diagnostics, San Diego, CA).
Serum levels of C-reactive protein were assayed by immunoturbidimetry using kit supplied by Behring Diagnostics (GmbH,
Marburg, Germany). Commercially available enzyme-linked
immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kits were utilized for assessment
of TNF- a (Sigma-Saint Louis, Missouri, Germany) (Catalog
number: CKH-200A) with kit sensitivity 4.4 pg/ml, and IL-6
ELISA kits (Biocompare; antibodies-online; Schloss-Rahe-Str.
15, Aachen, Germany) (Catalog number: ABIN414297) with
assay sensitivity 6.4 pg/mL.

Lipid profile

Lipid profile was done including fasting cholesterol, low-density
lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and. triglycerides measured on Synchron CX9 auto-analyzer (Beckman
Instruments Inc.; Scientific Instruments Division, Fullerton,

CA 92634-3100, USA).
Statistical Analysis

Data were analyzed using SPSS version 22 (IBM). Shapiro-Wilk

test was used to examine normality of numerical data distribu
tion. Mean and SD represented the normally distributed numerical variables and the two independent sample (unpaired) Student
t-test was used to compare intergroup differences between the
two groups. Levene’s test was used to examine equality of variances between groups. Mean and SD represented the non-normally
distributed numerical data and Mann-Whitney U test was used
to compare intergroup differences between the two groups. Pearson’ correlation was used to check normally distributed variables
for linear correlation. However, Spearman’s Rank correlation was
used for Non-Normally distributed variables. Categorical variables were presented as number or proportion and percentage,
and intergroup differences were compared using Fischer’s exact
test (for nominal data) or Chi-Squared Test for Trend (for ordinal
data). The diagnostic value of serum continuous variables was examined by Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The area under the ROC Curve (AUC) was compared with
that of random prediction. The relationship between normally
distributed variables was investigated by linear regression and
curve estimation was used to plot these relations. A two-sided
p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A two-sided p-value < 0.01 was considered highly statistically significant.

Discussion

The pathogenesis of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) remains unknown, but autoimmune abnormalities, disorders of
histamine-releasing factors, and cellular defects have all been
involved (16). Patients with CSU have an increased risk of antecedent hyperlipidemia. Little studies had formerly reported a
link between hyperlipidemia and CSU, however, an increased
level of inflammatory markers as IL-1, Il-6, and TNF-a in both
patients with CSU and those with metabolic syndrome has been
signi fied (9,10,11). Hence, the rationale of the current study
was to investigate the possible association between chronic urticaria and hyperlipidemia.

In our study, there was highly statistically significant increase in
group 1 compared to group 2 in serum Cholesterol, TG, LDL,
and statistically significant decrease in HDL. However, non-sig
 

nificant difference regarding gender, age or CRP was found. TG
and cholesterol were positively correlated with duration of illness,
urticaria activity score and serum TNF a. Serum LDL was positively correlated with duration of illness, urticaria activity score,
serum CRP TNF a, and serum HDL detected significant negative correlation with serum TNF a.

This is in correspondence with Chung and colleagues, who found
a 1.65-fold increased risk of antecedent hyperlipidemia in 36.1%
of CU patients in comparison to controls after adjusting for possible confounding factors (17). Another cross-sectional study was
conducted on 131 patients in Korea and concluded that metabolic syndrome was an independent predictor of uncontrolled
CSU (13). This is in agreement with our study, but ours detected
only the hyperlipidemia among patients with CSU.

In addition, Kobayashi detected in patients with in comparison
to with controls elevation of serum lipids, cholesterol, B-lipoprotein and phospholipids (18). Also, Kobayashi and coworkers
investigated serum lipids further (19) and found a correlation between serum lipids, fatty acids and chronic urticaria (20). These
laboratory results suggested that serum lipids and fatty acids are
chemical mediators and play a role in inducing urticaria.

These outcomes can be clarified by several probabilities. Various studies found an association between hyperlipidemia
and inflammatory markers which were also observed in CSU
(9,10,21). Besides, CSU is considered a skin disease, induced
by mast cells activation (22), which were also linked with hyperlipidemia or atherosclerotic disease. Mast cells, as a part of both
innate and adaptive immune system, could have a role in endothelial inflammation (23) which was found to be corresponding
to the atherosclerotic disease immensity (24).

Vascular mast cells, present within the adventitia and atherosclerotic plaques, (25) can modify lipid metabolism by hindering
the ApoE- and ApoA-II-dependent cholesterol efflux (26). Besides, increased collagen content was observed in mast cell-deficient mice in addition to fibrous cap development, and reduced
local inflammation leading to decreased atherosclerosis (27).
Mast cells which accumulate in the atherosclerotic lesions (28)
are then activated by the pro-inflammatory stimuli, as C3a and
C5a, and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (29). Activated mast cells, in turn, release a broad array of proinflammatory cytokines affecting the development of CSU (22). Thus, the
potential link between hyperlipidemia and CSU may be due to
the presence of systemic inflammation which influences them
both. Whether systemic inflammation or mast cells activation

 

are involved in the pathogenesis of CSU following hyperlipidemia need further research to clarify.
Hyperlipidemia and chronic spontaneous urticaria

The current study detected a highly statistically significant increase
in group 1 in contrast to group 2 as regards serum IL6 and TNFa.
Serum IL6 show significant positive correlation with urticaria activity score while serum TNF @. shows significant positive correlation
with duration of illness (p-0.003) and urticaria activity score.

This is in agreement with Kasperska-Zajac and coworkers, who
observed significant elevation of serum IL-6 and CRP in CSU
patients compared with the healthy controls. IL-6 concentration
was positively correlated with weekly UAS-7 and the different
degrees of urticarial activity. Increased serum IL-6 in association
with CRP changes reflect the link between CSU and systemic
inflammation (10).

Our results are also in accordance with Young-Min and. colleagues who found patients with metabolic syndrome to be
older, and had a higher mean UAS and serum levels of TNF-a
compared with controls (13). However, our study studied only
patients with hyperlipidemia who had higher level of TNF a
and positively correlated with urticaria activity score but had
non-significant correlation with age.

Mast cells and basophils are the predominant cells in the development of chronic urticaria (30), in which proinflammatory
cytokines as TNF-a and IL-6 are incremented in the initiation
and progression of their degranulation process (31,32). Levels of
TNF-a was found to be significantly elevated in patients with CU
with metabolic syndrome, and were directly harmonized with
higher UAS. This is in agreement with foregoing studies, which
showed that plasma levels of TNF-a, IL-6 and CRP were significantly correlated with CSU clinical activity (10). Consequently,
TNF-a inhibitors may beneficial in refractory CSU (33) as elevated serum levels of IL- 6 and TNF-a induce basophil activation,
histamine release and leukotriene production in CSU (34).
Moreover, a link between hypertriglyceridemia and increased
TNF-a serum level is detected (36). TNF-a can affect serum
level of TG by acting on both adipose tissue and liver. It increases the production of free fatty acids (37), decrease level of TGrich lipoproteins (VLDLs) in the circulation by diminishing its
clearance (36) and stimulates lipolysis in human adipose tissue
(38). TNF-a can also increase plasma TG concentrations by the
inhibition of lipoprotein lipase activity (39).

Besides, TNF-a. may interfere with cholesterol metabolic pathways. TNF-a can inhibit the expression and activity of the ratelimiting enzyme of cholesterol elimination leading to decrease
hepatic cholesterol catabolism and excretion (40). Moreover, it
can down-regulate the activities of rate-limiting enzymes in the
alternative pathway of bile acid synthesis. Hence, TNF-a decreases cholesterol elimination from the body and its availability
during the acute phase response for other hepatic processes (41).
IL-6 concentration is increased in CSU (42) and coordinated
with its activity (10). IL-6, in addition, can lead to lipid abnormalities (43) through inhibition of adipocyte lipoprotein

lipase activity (44), increased induction of hepatic triglyceride
secretion (45) and increased plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) (46).
Hence cytokines operate both as a cascade and as a network regulating the production of each other, increased IL-6 may reflect
the actions of other cytokines as TNF-a.

Different immunomodulatory therapies were assessed in CSU
including statins (47). Statins, apart from their lipid-lowering
activity, have anti-inflammatory effects on basophils and the
major proinflammatory effector cells by multiple mechanisms
(48). Statins can inhibit the growth and activation of human
basophils, as detected by Majlesi and colleagues (49). Administration of statins for 3 months, decreased the patients’ symptoms
assessed by urticarial score compared to before treatment. Hence,
statins could be effective not only in hyperlipidemia but also in
the treatment of chronic urticaria and it could alleviate the patients’ symptoms in severe and resistant forms of urticaria (47).

Conclusion

There is a link between CSU and hyperlipidemia. IL6 and
TNF-a associated systemic inflammation could be a common
pathogenic mechanism of CSU and hyperlipidemia. More studies are needed on wider scales to clarify the possible pathophysiological mechanisms for prevention and early identification.
Patients with severe and uncontrolled CSU should be evaluated
for hyperlipidemia to improve CSU outcomes. We can reduce
atherosclerosis and its complications with prompt detection
and suitable management. Thus, both of CSU consequences
and patients’ quality of life might be better. Early detection of
hyperlipidemia among CSU patients will pave a way for better
interventions for this disease.
