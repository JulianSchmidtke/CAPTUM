ABSTRACT

Omalizumab has been approved for the treatment of recalcitrant chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). However, it
remains unanswered whether omalizumab modifies a CSU course. We aimed to study a course of CSU after omalizumab treatment in an Asian population. Medical records of recalcitrant CSU patients who attended Siriraj
Hospital between 2013 and 2017 were reviewed. All patients receiving omalizumab treatment were followed after
the first injection for at least 1 year. Of 15 patients receiving omalizumab treatment, 11 patients (73.3%)
responded well to 150 mg while the rest required 300 mg. The median follow-up period was 18 months (range,
13.5-25.3). Three patterns of response were proposed and measured: excellent (disease remission over than
6 months) was found in 20%; good (injection interval extended longer than 6 months) was found in 27%; and
modest (frequently required injections) was found in 53%. The mean duration of complete remission was
33 weeks (range, 26-38). Two-thirds of patients had disease relapse and required omalizumab injections to control symptoms. The other third did not show relapses for at least 69 weeks of the follow-up period. After 1 year of
treatment, Kaplan-Meier curves estimated that a higher percentage (86.7%) of recalcitrant CSU patients receiving
omalizumab treatment would be free of symptoms (weekly Urticaria Activity Score = 0) without prednisolone and/
or cyclosporin as compared with 42% of patients not receiving omalizumab treatment. In conclusion, patients
seem to be easily and safely manageable with omalizumab. Prednisolone and cyclosporin could be discontinued
in all patients. Further studies are needed to conclude whether omalizumab can exactly modify CSU.

Key words: modify chronic spontaneous urticaria course, omalizumab, recalcitrant chronic spontaneous
urticaria, treatment, weekly Urticaria Activity Score.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is characterized by an
occurrence of itchy wheals and flares for a consecutive
6 weeks or more with or without identified causes.’ Autoimmunity is proposed to be one of the most frequent causes
of CSU. For type | autoimmunity, type | autoantigens or
autoallergens such as immunoglobulin (Ig)E anti-dsDNA and
IgE anti-thyroperoxidase can activate mast cells and basophils by cross-linking IgE autoantibodies (AAb). For type Il
autoimmunity, IgG AAb can activate mast cells and basophils
by binding to IgE or to FceRI, which may then involve C5a
and CD88/C5aR receptor. Many studies reported that omalizumab (monoclonal anti-IgE antibodies) is very effective in
the treatment of refractory CSU.** Recent proposed mechanisms of action of omalizumab in CSU patients with type |
autoimmunity is that omalizumab rapidly binds free IgE AAb
and forms omalizumab-IgE immune complexes. These

complexes bind autoallergens and reduce mast cell activation, causing rapid response to treatment within 1 week in
more than half of the patients. For type Il autoimmunity,
omalizumab causes downregulation of free IgE, resulting in
downregulation of FceRI on mast cell surfaces, which makes
them less susceptible to activation by IgG anti-lgE and IgG
anti-FceRI. These patients respond more slowly to omalizumab treatment.? Gericke et al. suggested that patients
with positive basophil histamine release test or positive
autologous serum skin test tended to have slow response to
omalizumab.°

Currently, an important issue of whether omalizumab can
have a role in modifying a course of CSU remains unanswered.
This study was aimed to determine the disease course of
recalcitrant CSU in patients who received omalizumab treatment in terms of duration of treatment until disease remission,
duration of remission and relapse rate after drug discontinuation in an Asian population.

METHODS

This study was ethically approved by the Siriraj Institutional
Review Board, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol
University, Bangkok, Thailand (approval no. Si656/2016). Medical records of CSU patients who visited the Skin Allergy Clinic,
Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, during March 2013 to February 2017
were retrospectively reviewed. Informed consent was written
and signed in all cases. Patients with omalizumab treatment
who were followed after the first injection for at least 1 year
were enrolled in the study.

A stepwise approach to initiate omalizumab in our recalcitrant CSU patients were followed according to the recommendations of the Dermatological Society, the Allergy, Asthma and
Immunology Association, and the Pediatric Dermatological
Society of Thailand.’ Due to its relatively high cost, a step-ladder treatment should be performed as follows: (i) a standard
dose of non-sedating H,-antihistamines for 2-4 weeks; (ii) up
to fourfold doses of modern second-generation antihistamines
for 2-4 weeks; (iii) combination with H,-antihistamines or leukotriene receptor antagonists and/or short course of oral corticosteroids at a dose of 10 mg/day or less for less than
4 weeks in patients who do not have contraindications; and (iv)
cyclosporin of 3 mg/kg per day may be added in patients who
do not have contraindications. In patients with corticosteroids
or cyclosporin dependence, corticosteroids or cyclosporin side
effects, and weekly Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) scores of
16 or more after this stepwise approach, omalizumab should
then be added as an add-on therapy. After a 150-mg omalizumab injection, patients with a significant improvement (reductions in UAS7 scores of >30%) can continue omalizumab
injection with the same dose by an interval of 4 weeks. Doubling the dose of omalizumab (300 mg) should be used in
patients with a reduction in UAS7 less than 30%. In patients
who have responded well, the injection interval of omalizumab
will be extended and then discontinued if it is possible.

The UAS7 score and medication score were used to assess
disease severity.2° The UAS7 consists of the daily number of
wheals (range, 0 [none] to 3 [severe]) and daily pruritus severity
(range, 0 [none] to 3 [severe]) for 7 days consecutively, with a
maximum sum score of 42. Disease severities were categorized as follows: complete response (0), well controlled (1-6),
mild (7-15), moderate (16-27) and severe (28-42).° All patients
were asked to record UAS7 by themselves for 1 week prior to
each follow up. The medication score is a quantitative severity
measurement score in CSU. The score is calculated based on
the sum of total drug use in CSU. Each drug is classified to
have a score as follows: antihistamines (2 points, regular dose;
8 points, up to fourfold dose), oral corticosteroids (<11 mg,
5 points; 11-25 mg, 10 points; >25 mg, 15 points), cyclosporin
(3 mg/kg, 8 points), hydroxychloroquine (6 points) and leukotriene receptor antagonist (2 points).°

It is assumed that total serum clearance of a drug from the
body should be equal to fivefold of the drug half-life."° Range
of serum terminal half-life of omalizumab was reported to be
between 18 and 26 days.’ © Based on maximal terminal half
life of omalizumab of 26 days, it should be eliminated from the
body within 130 days (5 months) after the last injection.'? In
our study, complete remission was defined as UAS7 of 0 without any medications for more than 6 months. For disease
relapse, patients who had recurrence of CSU after a 6-month
period of complete remission were considered to have had a
disease relapse. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to
investigate the probability of achieving: (i) a reduction in UAS7
of 30% or more from baseline (significant improvement); and
(ii) UAS7 of 0 without prednisolone and/or cyclosporin in the
omalizumab-treatment group and control group.'® To avoid
selection bias, patients in the control group of this observational retrospective study were recruited in the same period of
time as the patients in the study group. We recruited all recalcitrant CSU patients who had the same severity as patients in
the study group. All patients in the control group had at least
the first three-step-ladder approach but omalizumab was not
affordable due to financial problem or personal reasons.

RESULTS

This study included a total of 15 recalcitrant CSU patients who
underwent omalizumab treatment (eight women, seven men)
with a mean age of 42.9 + 14.2 years. The median follow-up
period was 18.9 + 3.8 months with a range between 13.5 and
25.3 months. Of 15 patients, 11 (73.3%) responded well to
150 mg while four patients (26.7%) required up-dosing to
300 mg omalizumab. Table 1 shows disease activity, treatment
duration and duration of remission of patients receiving
150 mg omalizumab injection. All patients had_ significant
improvement (230% reductions in UAS7) after 150-mg omalizumab treatment.

Three patients (1-3) had complete remission (free of CSU
symptoms without omalizumab and conventional therapies for
>6 months) with the mean duration of 33 weeks. Mean duration of omalizumab treatment before complete remission was
23.7 weeks (range, 15-34). Patients 1 and 2 had complete
remission for 26 and 38 weeks, respectively, and then experienced disease relapse. During the flare-up period, their symptoms were uncontrolled despite fourfold non-sedating H,antihistamine. Omalizumab with the same dose was re-initiated
which showed similar good response. In patient 1, CSU symptoms could be controlled with one injection of omalizumab.
Only antihistamines were required during the follow-up period
(81 weeks) after re-treatment.

Three patients (4-6) remained asymptomatic for a long duration (range, 39-53 weeks) by using antihistamines during omalizumab extension. Five patients (7-11) had to receive
omalizumab injection every 4 up to 12 weeks together with
antihistamine intake. After omalizumab administration, all
patients could discontinue cyclosporin and systemic corticosteroids.

Table 2 demonstrates disease activity, treatment duration
and duration of remission of patients receiving 300-mg omalizumab injection. Patient 13 had both CSU and cold urticaria
while patient 15 had CSU, angioedema and asthma. No
patients in this group had complete remission and only one

Figure 1. (a) In the omalizumab-treatment group, 66.7% and
100% of recalcitrant chronic spontaneous patients had a significant improvement without prednisolone and/or cyclosporin
at weeks 1 and 8, respectively. In the control group, 0% and
27% of patients achieved a significant improvement at weeks
1 and 8, respectively. (b) After initiating the treatment for
1 year, 86.7% of recalcitrant chronic spontaneous urticaria
(CSU) patients who underwent omalizumab treatment and 42%
of those who did not undergo omalizumab treatment (control
group) were free of CSU symptoms (Urticaria Activity Score of

patient (12) could achieve complete CSU control (UAS7 = 0)
with a low dose of non-sedating H;-antihistamines and prolonged duration of omalizumab for 39 weeks. The UAS7 scores
increased from 0 to 15 and then 150 mg omalizumab was
administrated in this case with favorable response. All of them
could discontinue prednisolone and cyclosporin. No adverse
events were reported in all cases.

The control group included 30 patients (22 women, eight
men) who had had at least the first of the three-step-ladder
approach without omalizumab treatment. The mean age of the
control group was 43.4 + 16.9 years. Kaplan-Meier analysis
demonstrated a probability of recalcitrant CSU patients achieving: (i) a significant improvement (a reduction in UAS7 of

initiation of the treatment. In the omalizumab-treatment group,
66.7% and 100% of patients had a significant improvement
without prednisolone and/or cyclosporin at weeks 1 and 8,
respectively. In the control group, 0% and 27% of patients
achieved a significant improvement at weeks 1 and 8, respectively (Fig. 1a). After initiating the treatment for 1 year, 86.7%
who underwent omalizumab treatment and 42% of the patients
who did not undergo omalizumab treatment were free of CSU
symptoms (UAS7 = 0) without prednisolone and/or cyclosporin
(Fig. 1b).

DISCUSSION

Reported long-term studies of omalizumab treatment of chronic
urticaria are summarized in Table 3.'7** Complete response or
complete control of CSU symptoms were mentioned in most
studies but information on other treatments during response was
inexact. To our knowledge, there is no consensus regarding the
definition of complete remission after omalizumab treatment.
Patients who do not have CSU symptoms without any medications for longer than 6 months were defined has having disease
remission in our study. Metz et al.'” studied 25 (CSU and chronic
inducible urticaria) patients by using omalizumab 150-600 mg
every 2-4 weeks. All patients had complete control of their
symptoms (defined as >90% improvement) without the requirement of any other drug use after their first omalizumab injection.
All patients showed relapse of disease within 2 weeks to
7 months. After the first dose of omalizumab re-initiation, rapid
and complete responses were reported in all patients. However,
our study focused on the disease course of recalcitrant CSU
patients who received omalizumab in terms of duration of treatment until disease remission, duration of remission and relapse
rate after drug discontinuation.

Kolkhir et a/.? classified the initial response of CSU patients
to omalizumab as rapid and slow responses. In terms of duration of treatment until disease remission, duration of remission
and relapse rate after drug discontinuation, we classified our
patients into three groups as follows:

1 Excellent response (20%): these patients had disease remission (UAS7 of 0 without any medications for >6 months). In
this group (three patients of the 150-mg group), remission
occurred after 15-34 weeks of omalizumab injections despite
previous prednisolone and cyclosporin intake. Compared
with the natural course of CSU, it seemed that omalizumab
may help physicians to control recalcitrant CSU more easily
without medications with potential side-effects. It should be
noted here that two of three patients had disease relapse.
However, their disease relapse could be easily controlled
with the same dose and only a few injections of omalizumab.

2 Good response (27%): injection interval of omalizumab could
be extended longer than 6 months. Our four patients (4-6 of
the 150-mg group and patient 12 of the 300-mg group),
injection interval could be extended up to more than 1 year
(mean, 43.7 weeks; range, 39-53). This group did not have
disease remission because antihistamines were needed to
control their CSU symptoms but they required omalizumab

injections less frequently. Previous prednisolone and cyclosporin could be discontinued.

3 Modest response (63%): omalizumab injections were more frequently required than the second group to control their symptoms. Our eight patients (7-11 of the 150-mg group and
patients 13-15 of the 300-mg group) required omalizumab
injections every 4-12 weeks to control their symptoms. Even
though antihistamines were needed in all patients, prednisolone and cyclosporin could be discontinued.

Before the era of omalizumab, clearing of CSU symptoms
after 1 and 5 years was reported to be 20-80%, and 84-96%,
respectively.2° °° Kozel et al.2° reported the natural course of
physical and chronic urticaria and angioedema in 220 patients.
Among their 78 patients with CSU, 47.4% were free of symptoms after 1 year. Of those with urticaria only, angioedema only,
and both urticaria and angioedema, 38.5%, 20% and 59.5%
were free of symptoms after 1 year, respectively. Kulthanan
et al.?° reported that 34.5% and 84% of Thai CSU patients were
free of symptoms without any medications after 1 and 5 years,
respectively, from the onset of disease. Hiragun et al.°° reported
prognosis of 117 CSU patients whose disease could not be controlled by a standard dose of antihistamines. Disease remission
was defined as no symptom for 1 month or more without any
medications. The estimated remission rates in Hiragun et al.’s
study at 1, 2 and 5 years from the first visit were 11.5%, 13.9%
and 27.7%, respectively. Our Kaplan-Meier curve showed that
an increased percentage of recalcitrant CSU patients who
underwent omalizumab treatment achieved a_ significant
improvement (a reduction in UAS7 of >30%) within 1 and
8 weeks of treatment as compared with those who did not
undergo omalizumab treatment. Similarly, a higher percentage
of recalcitrant CSU patients who underwent omalizumab treatment were free of CSU symptoms (UAS7 = 0) without prednisolone and/or cyclosporin after 1 year as compared with those
of the control group. It should be noted here that we had a small
number of cases and limited follow-up period.

In conclusion, recalcitrant CSU patients seem to be easily
manageable with omalizumab. Prednisolone and cyclosporin
could be discontinued in all patients. Further studies with a larger number of patients and longer follow-up period are needed
to conclude whether omalizumab can exactly modify the natural course of CSU.
