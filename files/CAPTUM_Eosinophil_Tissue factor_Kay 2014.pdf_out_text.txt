Background In chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) mast cell activation together
with inflammatory changes in the skin are well documented and may play an
important role in mechanisms of tissue oedema.

Objectives To confirm and extend these observations by measuring microvascular
markers, leucocytes and mast cell numbers in lesional and uninvolved skin and
to compare findings with a control group.

Methods Paired biopsies (one from 4—8-h spontaneous weals and one from uninvolved skin) were taken from eight patients with CSU and nine control subjects
and studied using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy using the lectin Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1 (UEA-1).

Results Lesional skin in CSU contained significantly more CD31+ endothelial cells;
CD31+ blood vessels, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils and macrophages; and
CD3+ T cells than nonlesional skin. Increased vascularity was confirmed by confocal imaging using the lectin UEA-1. Uninvolved skin from CSU contained sig
 

nificantly more CD31+ endothelial cells, CD31+ blood vessels and eosinophils
compared with the control subjects. There was a threefold increase in mast cell
numbers when CSU was compared with controls but no difference was observed
between lesional and uninvolved skin.

Conclusions Increased vascular markers together with eosinophil and neutrophil
infiltration are features of lesional skin in CSU and might contribute to tissue
oedema. Eosinophils and microvascular changes persist in uninvolved skin,
which, together with increased mast cells, suggests that nonlesional skin is
primed for further wealing.

 

What’s already known about this topic?

e Farlier studies, mainly using conventional histology, showed increases in eosinophils and neutrophils in chronic urticaria weals.
e There are conflicting reports on mast cell numbers.

 

What does this study add?

e Increases in vascularity, as well as eosinophil, neutrophil and basophil infiltration
are features of lesional skin in chronic spontaneous urticaria.

e Uninvolved skin may be primed as there were persisting vascular markers and eosinophils, as well as increases in mast cells.

506 Inflammation and chronic spontaneous urticaria, A.B. Kay et al.

Chronic spontaneous (‘idiopathic’) urticaria (CSU) is a common disease associated with recurrent weals and/or angiooedema believed to result from intermittent activation of skin
mast cells by unknown mechanisms.' Wealing in patients with
CSU affects the upper and mid-dermis and is characterized by
a local or generalized red, raised, itchy rash with vasodilatation, increased blood flow and vascular permeability. Although
functional autoantibodies against the high-affinity IgE receptor
(FceR1) have been demonstrated in about one-third of
patients with CSU, suggesting an autoimmune basis, the clinical significance of this finding still remains unclear.”

Characteristically the lesions of CSU arise spontaneously, peak
between 4 and 8 h, and generally resolve by 24 h. It is doubtful
whether histamine alone can account for persistent wealing especially as antihistamines, even in high doses, are often ineffective,
particularly in the severe form of the disease. In previous immunohistochemical studies, the presence of neutrophils and eosinophils in biopsies from urticarial weals was demonstrated.*” This
raised the possibility that both neutrophil-dependent oedema,
originally described by Wedmore and Williams,° and eosinophilmediated mast cell activation’ may be important mechanisms in
vascular leakage in CSU. For example, mast cell-mediated neutrophil recruitment with vascular leakage through the NLRP3
inflammasome was reported by Nakamura et al.* in a mouse
model of urticaria. Earlier studies, using conventional histology,
showed eosinophil and neutrophil infiltration in lesional, but not
in uninvolved, skin in chronic urticaria.” For all these reasons it
seemed important to confirm and extend these observations using
immunohistochemical methods. In addition we have used two
approaches to study changes in the microvasculature, ie. CD31
staining and confocal microscopy using the lectin Ulex europaeus
agglutinin 1 (UEA-1). Thus, although urticaria is by definition a
vascular reaction, with dilatation of postcapillary venules, as far as
we are aware new blood vessel formation in both involved and
uninvolved CSU skin has not previously been reported.

There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding the
numbers of cutaneous mast cells in CSU. Early studies using
morphological criteria alone reported that skin mast cells in
CSU are increased up to tenfold,”''® whereas subsequent studies using a specific mast cell antitryptase antibody did not
show this difference.'' For this reason we have also re-evaluated mast cell numbers in involved and uninvolved CSU skin
as well as healthy control skin.

Finally, we felt it important to determine whether uninvolved skin in CSU was ‘normal’ by determining whether
inflammatory changes persisted in areas where there was no
wealing. For this purpose we have compared inflammatory
cell infiltration and cutaneous microvasculature in nonlesional
CSU skin with healthy control skin.

Materials and methods

Patients and controls

Eight patients (five female, three male) with chronic spontane
ous urticaria (age range 32-71 years; mean 51 years) as

British Journal of Dermatology (2014) 171, pp505-511

defined by the EAACI/GA2LEN/EDE/WAO guidelines'? were
recruited from the urticaria clinic of the Department of Dermatology and Allergy at Charité-Universitatsmedizin Berlin.
The duration of disease ranged from 9 months to 14 years.
On the screening day, subjects were assessed for their suitability to enter the study, and informed consent was obtained. On
the study day, patients notified the clinical investigator as soon
as they observed an urticarial lesion on the thigh, trunk or
upper arm. Biopsies (either spindle-shaped or 4-mm punch)
were then taken from the lesions and a comparable area of
nonaffected skin (i.e. skin that was normal to the naked eye,
had no evidence of wealing and was not pruritic). Biopsies
were not taken from linear or asymmetrical weals. Skin biopsies were also taken from nine healthy subjects (five female
and four male), aged between 56 and 76 years (mean
59 years) who were recruited as controls.

None of the patients or controls had a history of concurrent
autoimmune, inflammatory (including osteoarthritis and
asthma) or infectious disease. None had had anaphylactic episodes. Patients with physical urticarias or urticarial vasculitis
were excluded. None had taken H, or H) selective antihistamines for the previous 3 days. Additional exclusion criteria
included the current or recent (< 4 weeks) use of oral corticosteroids or a leucotriene receptor antagonist, or the current
or recent (< 6 weeks) use of doxepin or other tricyclic antidepressants, or the current or recent (< 8 weeks) use of immunosuppressants (e.g. ciclosporin, azathioprine). One patient
took a single dose of prednisolone 50 mg as a rescue medication 3 days before the biopsy. At the time of the study there
was no presence of, or prior history of, malignancy. Patients
with acute illness, which, in the opinion of the investigator,
could pose a threat or harm to the volunteer or obscure interpretation of data, were excluded. Also excluded were drug
and alcohol abuse, pregnancy and lactation. The study was
approved by the ethics committee of the Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin and the NHS Health Research Authority,
UK. (ref. 07/Q0411/41).

Tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry

Tissue biopsies were immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (BDH Chemicals Ltd, Dagenham, U.K.) in 0-1 mol L~'
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7-4, and washed in 15%
PBS-buffered sucrose, embedded in optimum cutting temperature compound and snap-frozen in isopentane precooled in
liquid nitrogen. Samples were air-freighted to London on dry
ice and kept at —80 °C until use. Cryostat sections (6 Jim)
were cut from the biopsies, mounted on 0-1% poly-1-lysinecoated slides, dried overnight at 37 °C, then stored with silica
gel (VWR International Ltd, Lutterworth, U.K.) at —80 °C

until used.

Immunohistochemistry

Antibody staining was detected by the alkaline phosphatase—

antialkaline phosphatase (APAAP) method, as previously

described.'*'* Normal human serum (10%) was used to prevent nonspecific binding of the second- and third-layer antibodies. A mouse IgGl myeloma protein and a rabbit IgG
protein were used as negative controls. Monoclonal antibodies
against CD31, CD68, mast cell tryptase and neutrophil elastase
were purchased from Dako Ltd (Ely, U.K.) and anti-CD3 from
Becton Dickinson (Oxford, U.K.). Primary antibodies were
detected with a secondary donkey antimouse antibody
obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.
(West Grove, PA, U.S.A.). APAAP was obtained from Dako
Ltd. Positively stained cells were detected with Fast Red
(Sigma, Poole, U.K.). Affinity-purified polyclonal antimajor
basic protein (MBP) was obtained from Dr H. Kita (Mayo
Clinic, Rochester, MN, U.S.A.) and antibasogranulin monoclonal (BB1) was a gift from Dr Andrew F. Walls (University of
Southampton, Southampton, U.K.). Cells were counted in a
blind fashion at x400 magnification on an Olympus BX40
microscope (Olympus Imaging & Audio Ltd, Southend-on-Sea,
U.K.) connected with a Zeiss Vision KS300 imaging system
(Carl Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany) and total cells expressing
phenotypic markers enumerated in two entire biopsy sections.
CD31+ endothelial cells were counted as described.'? For
CD31+ blood vessels, we used the methods of Hashimoto
et al.,'* modified by Corrigan et al.'* Microvessels were identified as CD31+ vascular endothelium forming a round or
spherical structure, which was considered a CD31+ blood vessel. The total number of vessels of entire sections were
counted and divided by the total areas measured by the imaging system. Data were expressed as the total numbers of cells
per unit area. The mean + SD entire cross-sectional area of the
cutaneous biopsy sections was 4-2 + 0-4 mm’. The betweenobserver coefficients of variation for duplicate counts of all

markers examined for cutaneous biopsies were 4-4—6-8%.

Immunofluorescence staining for confocal microscopy

Labelling of sections with the endothelial marker, UEA-1 lectin, was performed using a modification of a protocol used
previously.'® Briefly, frozen sections were thawed at room
temperature for 30 min, then permeabilized and blocked in
0-1% saponin/5% human serum in PBS for 30 min at room
temperature. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated UEA-1 lectin (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, U.K.) was added to
the sections for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. Slides
in PBS 3 x 5 min,

mounted on sections using VectaShield Hardset mounting

were washed then coverslips were
medium (Vector Laboratories), and stored at 4 °C. Sections
were examined using a Leica SP2 confocal microscope system
(Leica, Milton Keynes, U.K.) fitted with argon ion and 561nm diode lasers, and images were acquired using the Leica

confocal software.

Statistics

Data were analysed with the aid of a commercially available

statistical package (Minitab for Windows release 9.2; Minitab

Inc., Coventry, U.K.). Significant differences between paired
data obtained from lesional and nonlesional biopsies were calculated using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The Mann—Whitney U-test (with Bonferroni’s correction) was used to
compare variance between groups. For all tests P < 0-05 was

considered significant.

Results

Chronic spontaneous urticaria weals showed significant
increases in eosinophils, neutrophils, basophils,
macrophages, T cells, endothelial cells and blood
vessels

There were significantly more MBP+ eosinophils (P = 0-01,
approximate sixfold increase), elastase-positive neutrophils
(P = 0-001, approximate 14-fold increase), BB1+ basophils
(P = 0-04, approximate twofold increase) and CD68+ macrophages (P = 0-01, approximate 30% increase) in lesional compared with nonlesional skin of patients with CSU (Fig. 1).
Similar results were obtained for CD3+ T cells (P = 0-011,
approximate threefold increase, data not shown). Photomicrographic examples of MBP+, elastase-positive, BB1+ cells and
CD68+ macrophages in involved and uninvolved skin of
patients with CSU are shown in Figure 2. There were small
but significant increases in CD31+ endothelial cells (P = 0-04,
50% and CD31+ blood

(P = 0-02, approximate 50% increase) when lesional was

approximate increase) vessels
compared with nonlesional skin (Fig. 3). Confocal microscopy
using UEA-1 staining confirmed the increase in lesional vs.

nonlesional blood vessels detected by CD31 staining (Fig. 4).

Mast cell and eosinophil numbers, as well as blood
vessels, are increased in nonlesional chronic
spontaneous urticaria skin compared with the skin of
control subjects

There was an approximate threefold increase in the numbers
of mast cells in nonlesional compared with control skin
(P = 0:0006) (Fig. Sa). Photomicrographic examples of skin
mast cells are shown in Figure 5b—d. There was also a significant increase in the numbers of MBP+ eosinophils (P = 0-02),
but not neutrophils, basophils, T cells or macrophages, in
nonlesional CSU skin compared with controls (Fig. 1, and
data not shown). In addition CD31+ endothelial cells and
CD31+ blood vessels were significantly elevated (P = 0-004
and P = 0-007, respectively) when uninvolved skin was compared with controls (Fig. 3).

There were no significant relationships between the duration of disease and the expression of vascular and inflamma
tory markers.

Discussion

The novel findings in this study are firstly that in CSU, lesional
skin has significantly more CD31+ endothelial cells and

CD31+ blood vessels, as well as eosinophils and neutrophils, finding was the observation that uninvolved skin, unlike skin
than uninvolved skin, supporting the view that inflammatory from the control group, appeared to have persisting
cell infiltration contributes to vascular leakage. Basophils, mac- eosinophils and CD31+ endothelial cells and CD31+ blood
rophages and T cells were also increased in lesional compared vessels on a background of raised mast cell counts. The latter
with nonlesional skin but these differences were less marked findings suggest that nonlesional skin, unlike ‘normal’ skin,
than with eosinophils and neutrophils. The second novel may be primed for further wealing. Although the number of

subjects in the study group was small, the differences in the
various markers measured were statistically significant and
often substantial.

Although histamine is clearly a key mediator in CSU it is
unlikely to account solely for the entire wealing process characteristically observed over a 24-h period. Biopsies from CSU
weals have several pathological features in common with the
allergen-induced late-phase allergic skin reaction (LPR). In
order to support the view that the LPR can serve as a model
for CSU we considered it important to take biopsies from
weals of > 4 h duration (when the LPR is established and the
early histamine reaction is resolved) and < 8 h (when the LPR
begins to decline). Sabroe et al.? observed more neutrophils
and eosinophils in lesional compared with uninvolved skin.
However, they took biopsies from weals at < 4 h and > 12 h.
The differences they reported, although significant, were not
as marked as those observed in the 4-8-h biopsies used in the
present study. In contrast to our own findings, these same
investigators did not find an increase in eosinophils in uninvolved skin. However, the affinity-purified polyclonal antiMBP used in the present study'” appeared to be more stringent in detecting tissue eosinophils. Polyclonal anti-MBP antibody detects multiple epitopes on MBP molecules and thus
may allow us to identify eosinophils with greater sensitivity
than with a monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, close examination of the photomicrograph reveals diffuse extracellular
staining of eosinophil MBP, particularly in lesional skin, suggesting that some component(s) of eosinophils are released
into the tissues. Elevated serum concentrations of eotaxin, a
potent eosinophil chemotactic factor, have previously been
identified in CSU and presumably reflect ongoing mast cell
activation.'* Whether eosinophils and their products contribute directly to wealing in CSU, or act more as repair cells, is
presently unclear. Eosinophil-derived MBP does have direct,
nonspecific, mast cell degranulating properties that may be
relevant to mechanisms.”

We propose that in CSU mast cell activation leads to wealing by at least two mechanisms, i.e. histamine release and
inflammatory cell infiltration producing neutrophil-dependent
oedema. At the same time angiogenic factors, particularly vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), are expressed. VEGF is
known to be released by activated mast cells and has a rapid
effect on endothelial cells.'? We (article submitted for publication), and others,!® have shown VEGF expression in the skin
of CSU. Thus increased VEGF brings about new blood vessel
formation as shown in our present study by increases in
CD31+ endothelial cells and CD31+ blood vessels. It is
assumed that when urticarial weals resolve, either spontaneously or as the result of treatment, so do the numbers of
inflammatory cells and CD31+ endothelial cells and blood vessels. However, as shown in Figure 3, the number of CD31+
endothelial cells and CD31+ blood vessels did not return to
baseline levels, i.e. to those of the control group.

We have confirmed our previous findings of low numbers
of basophils in biopsies from CSU* and here extend this to

demonstrate slightly higher numbers in lesional compared

British Journal of Dermatology (2014) 171, pp505-511

with nonlesional skin. The significance of this observation is
unclear, as the overall numbers are small compared with neutrophils and eosinophils. However, we cannot exclude a role
for basophil products in vascular leakage events. The recruitment of basophils to skin lesions in patients with CSU may
explain the basopenia commonly seen in these patients.”°

Although urticaria is by definition a vascular reaction, with
dilatation of postcapillary venules, as far as we are aware this is
the first demonstration of new blood vessel formation in both
involved and uninvolved CSU skin. We were surprised that
new blood vessel formation appeared to occur quite rapidly,
ie. in 4~8-h weals. However, in an earlier study using human
endothelial cell cultures, VEGF-induced early endothelial cell
activation, as shown by enhanced inositol phosphate accumulation, occurred within 5 min, and increased P-selectin expression was demonstrated within 15 min.'? Previous studies
identified elevations of P- and E-selectin, and intercellular
adhesion molecule-1 in both lesional and nonlesional skin,
indicating that in this disease small vessels are ‘primed’ even at
baseline.*' The present study supports these findings in that
there was greater expression of CD31+ endothelial cells and
CD31+ blood vessels in lesional compared with nonlesional
skin, and nonlesional skin compared with controls, observations confirmed by confocal imaging with the lectin UEA-1.
Therefore, uninvolved skin is not normal as there are persisting
eosinophils, increased mast cell numbers and a greater number
of blood vessels compared with controls. We found no association between the duration of disease and the expression of vascular markers, indicating that these changes occur within
months rather than years following the onset of symptoms.

In conclusion, we have shown that vascular markers,
together with eosinophil and neutrophil infiltration, are the
dominant features of lesional skin in CSU and may contribute
to tissue oedema. On the other hand, eosinophils and microvascular changes persist in uninvolved sites and might,
together with increased mast cells, prime skin for further

wealing.
