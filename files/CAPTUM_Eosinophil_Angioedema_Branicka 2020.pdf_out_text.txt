Abstract

Background: The _eosinophil/neutrophil/platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios (ELR, NLR, and PLR) have been used as clinical
markers of systemic inflammation. However, they have not
yet been tested in various subtypes of immediate hypersensitivity to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Objectives: To assess the ELR, NLR, and PLR in various types
of hypersensitivity to NSAIDs. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of complete blood cell count and the ELR,
NLR, and PLR was performed. Appropriate types of hypersensitivity to NSAIDs were diagnosed based on the anamnesis
and drug provocation tests. The analysis covered 97 patients.
Twenty were diagnosed with NERD (NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease), 20 with NECD (NSAID-exacerbated cutaneous disease), 38 with NIUA (NSAID-inducted urticaria/angioedema), and 19 with SNIUAA (single-NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema or anaphylaxis). Two controls groups were
included: the first covered 15 patients with bronchial asthma
and the second 28 patients with chronic spontaneous urti
caria without NSAID hypersensitivity. Results: The NLR did
not differ significantly between the NSAID hypersensitivity
types. The ELR was significantly higher in NERD patients, and
the PLR was significantly lower in NECD patients than in patients with other types of NSAID hypersensitivity and in controls. Conclusions: The ELR and PLR may be useful in differentiating various types of immediate hypersensitivity to
NSAIDs. Moreover, the ELR may be helpful in differentiating
patients with bronchial asthma with and without NSAID hypersensitivity and PLR in differentiating patients with chron
ic spontaneous urticaria from NECD. © 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel

Introduction

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have
high analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic efficacy. Because of their easy availability, also over the counter, they are used by all age groups and often even overused. Incidence of hypersensitivity to NSAIDs has been
reported between 0.6 and 5.7% of the general populations

1]. Hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs belong to type
B adverse drug reactions which are dose-independent,
unpredictable, noxious, and unintended response to a
drug taken at a dose normally used in humans. Moreover,
hypersensitivity reactions occur in susceptible individuals [2, 3]. The reactions are divided depending on the
mechanism into not immunological and immunological
(IgE or T-cell mediated) and based on the time of reacions into immediate or delayed [4]. The first classificaion of hypersensitivity to NSAIDs presented by Stevenson et al. [5] in 2001 was based on clinical symptoms, the
presence of chronic disease, and cross-reactivity with
other COX-1 inhibitors. Up-to-date NSAID hypersensiivity is divided into 3 not immunologically mediated
ypes: (1) NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease
(NERD), (2) NSAID-exacerbated cutaneous disease
(NECD), and (3) NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema
(NIUA) and 2 immunologically mediated types: (1) single-NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema or anaphylaxis (SNIUAA) and (2) single-NSAID-induced delayed hypersensitivity reactions (SNIRD) [5]. Diagnosis of hypersensitivity to NSAIDs is based on a detailed anamnesis
and drug provocation tests (DPT). However, DPT are
sometimes associated with a high risk of hypersensitivity
reactions. Another impediment is the lack of laboratory
indicators that would make the diagnosis of NSAID hypersensitivity easier. The only commercially available in
vitro methods are estimation of serum IgE specific to pyrazolones and basophil activation test (BAT). However,
hey are very rarely used due to low sensitivity. They also
do not allow us to allocate different cases of hypersensiivity to the appropriate type.

The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), eosinophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (ELR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) calculated for complete blood cell count
(CBC) are markers of chronic inflammation that are
known to be inexpensive and easy to calculate with usage
of widely available methods. The usefulness of NLR, ELR,
and PLR measurements has been reported in many diseases in oncology [6-8], cardiology [9,10], pulmonology
11, 12], and rheumatology [13, 14]. In allergic diseases, the
usefulness of these ratios was evidenced in nasal polyposis
15-17], asthma [18, 19], and allergic rhinitis [20]. Moreover, high NLR and ELR have recently been found to serve
as useful indicators of systemic inflammation in smokers
21]. In the present study, we aimed to assess if the NLR,
ELR, and PLR may be useful in making diagnosis of various types of hypersensitivity to NSAIDs and to compare
with control groups and C-reactive protein (CRP), which
is the most commonly used marker of inflammation.

Methods

Study Design and Participants

The study was conducted at the Department of Internal Disease, Allergology and Clinical Immunology, University Clinical
Hospital K. Gibinskiego, Katowice, Poland. We retrospectively analyzed data on all patients that had been hospitalized between January 2011 and December 2018 with the diagnosis with number
D89.8 that describes in more detail the diagnosis of disorder involving the immune mechanism, and D89.9 that is a code used to
specify a diagnosis of unspecified disorder involving the immune
mechanism according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). These 2 codes were chosen because they were used
to describe hypersensitivity reactions to the drugs. J45 and L50
were used as secondary codes. Then, we chose patients with confirmed hypersensitivity to NSAIDs during hospitalization. The
typical allergological workup covered clinical history, and if the
clinical history was not sufficient, DPT were used so as to diagnose
an appropriate type of hypersensitivity to NSAIDs. Diagnosis of
types of NSAID hypersensitivity was based on the anamnesis and
DPT results [22]. Two control groups were formed from patients
hospitalized in our department with diagnosis of well-controlled
asthma without nasal polyps and with no anamnestic data on
NSAID hypersensitivity (J45) and chronic spontaneous urticaria
(L50), without history of NSAID hypersensitivity.

Clinical History

The detailed clinical history collected included pattern and
chronology of symptoms, the interval between administration of
the drug and the first symptoms, previous administration of
NSAIDs, and other medications taken. To properly record the
clinical history, we used a European Network for Drug Allergy
(ENDA) Questionnaire on Drug Hypersensitivity [3, 23]. In the
case of the history of 3 or more episodes of reaction to 2 different
NSAIDs, the cross-reactive type of hypersensitivity was diagnosed
and NERD or NECD was diagnosed if asthma or chronic urticaria
was present. In the case of 2 or more reactions to the same NSAID
with concomitant history of good tolerance to another NSAID,
selective type of immediate hypersensitivity to NSAIDs was suspected, and further diagnosis was based on DPT [22].

Drug Provocation Test

DPT were performed in accordance with the EAACI/GA2LEN
guidelines [3, 23]. Four increasing doses (27, 44, 117, and 312 mg)
of aspirin were administered every 2 h until a cumulative dose of
500 (the patient with asthma) or 1,000 (the other patients) mg is
reached [24]. If a patient shows no reaction after the last dose (total dose of 500 mg), another 500-mg aspirin could be given 1 h
after the previous dose. The cumulative dose in that case would be
1,000 mg of aspirin. In selected cases, DPT and drug tolerance tests
(DTT) with alternative NSAIDs were performed [24] according to
the following scheme: 1/4, 1/4, and 1/2 of a single dose and then 1
dose every 1 h. Spirometry was performed before the test and after
each drug administration in all patients with asthma and/or chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. A reaction was judged positive
ifa decrease in FEV1 by 220% of baseline occurred or when severe
extrabronchial symptoms of aspirin hypersensitivity appear (e.g.,
profound rhinorrhea and nasal blockade even if FEV1 fall did not
exceed 20%). A reaction was counted negative when the maximum
cumulative dose of aspirin was reached without a drop in FEV1

Laboratory Measurements

CBC and the CRP test were routinely performed in all patients
admitted to the department. Blood samples were collected in a hematologic sample tube containing an anticoagulant, and neutrophil, lymphocyte, eosinophil, and platelet absolute counts were recorded using a Sysmex XN-350 hematology analyzer (Sysmex Europe Corporation, Norderstedt, Germany). Using these data,
neutrophil, eosinophil, and platelet absolute numbers were divided by the lymphocyte absolute number, and NLR (neutrophil absolute number/lymphocyte absolute number), ELR (eosinophil
absolute number/lymphocyte absolute number), and PLR (platelet
absolute number/lymphocyte absolute number) values were calculated. The obtained data were compared among patients with
NERD, NECD, NIUA, and SNIUAA.

Statistical Analysis

The results of CBC were expressed as absolute number and
percentages. The NLR, ELR, and PLR were presented as median
and interquartile range. The x” test was used to analyze differences
in nominal variables between groups. Nonparametric KruskalWallis ANOVA and post hoc tests were used to compare the studied groups. All analyses were performed with a software package
(Statistica 13.3, StatSoft Poland, Krakow, Poland). p values <0.05
were considered significant.

Results

Between 2011 and 2018, 3,346 patients were hospital
ized with a diagnosis of drug hypersensitivity. After consid
ering exclusion criteria, 97 patients (female: 72, 73%) were
included to the final analysis. The mean age was 40.2 years
(range 19-70). Twenty patients (20.5%) were diagnosed
with NERD, 20 patients (20.5%) with NECD, 38 patients
(39.2%) with NIUA, and 19 patients (19.5% with SNIUAA)
(Fig. 1). The control group contained 43 patients were divided into 2 subgroups: the first group covering patients
with well-controlled asthma without nasal polyps and with
no anamnestic data on NSAID hypersensitivity (C-AST) to
compare with the NERD group and the second group covering patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (C-CSU)
to compare with NECD, NIUA, and SNIUAA groups. CAST included 15 patients, mean age 39.9 years (range 2166), and C-CSU included 28 patients, mean age 34.2 years
(range 22-59). The groups were comparable in terms of age
and sex distribution (p > 0.05) (Table 1). No cases of SNIRD
and NSAID-exacerbated food allergy (NEFA) were diagnosed. Patients did not take any medicines systemically.
DPT had been performed with appropriate nonselective
NSAIDs (acetylic acid, ketoprofen, diclofenac, naproxen,
and metamizol) in 61 patients, acetaminophen in 57 patients, and preferential inhibitors of COX-2 (nimesulid) in
8 patients, and DTT had been performed with a selective
inhibitor of COX-2 (celecoxib) in 77 patients.

The NLR in the NERD group was 1.62 (1.3-2.2);
NECD, 1.69 (1.4-3.1); NIUA, 1.81 (1.4-2.7); SNIUAA,
1.82 (1.5-2.3); and in C-AST, 1.97 (1.1-2.5) and C-CSU,
2.03 (1.4-2.4). No statistically significant difference was
found between the 4 groups with NSAID hypersensitivity
and control groups (p > 0.05) (Table 2; Fig. 2). The ELR
in the NERD group was 0.23 (0.1-0.2); NECD, 0.08 (0.060.1); NIUA, 0.09 (0.6-0.1); SNIUAA, 0.09 (0.05-0.1), CAST, 0.08 (0.06-0.09); and C-CSU, 0.076 (0.05-0.10).
The ELR was significantly higher in the NERD group
than in the NECD (p = 0.0009), NIUA (p = 0.0001), and
SNIUAA (p = 0.0007) groups and then in control groups
C-AST (p = 0.0008) and C-CSU (p = 0.0008) (Table 2;
Fig. 3). PLR values were significantly lower in the NECD
group (p = 0.0013) than in the NERD (p = 0.00004), NIUA
(p = 0.000001), and SNIUAA (0.00003) groups and then
in control groups C-AST (p = 0.0002) and C-CSU (p =
0.000009). The PLR in the NECD group was 65.30 (25.5140.0); NERD, 131.58 (77.4-250.8); NIUA, 129.10 (55.6234.2); and SNIUAA, 122.40 (68.0-237.6); and in C-AST,
116.24 (100.0-168.2) and C-CSU, 121.35 (95.8-159.5)
(Table 2; Fig. 4). The CRP value statistically significantly
correlated with NLR (r, = 0.26; p < 0.05) but not with ELR
(r, = 0.16) and PLR (r, = 0.04) in all patients with NSAID
hypersensitivity.

 

CBC Ratios in NSAID Hypersensitivity

Discussion

In this study, we tried to assess if some peripheral
blood cell ratios may be helpful to subcategorize NSAIDhypersensitive patients. Thus, we conducted a retrospective analysis in which we evaluated the NLR, ELR, and
PLR as potential diagnostic indicators in groups of patients with various types of NSAID hypersensitivity. We
found that the NLR was comparable in all examined
groups, the ELR was significantly higher in patients with
NERD, and the PLR was significantly lower in patients
with NECD (shown in Fig. 2-4; Table 2). We compared
the results with controls. We chose 2 control groups. The
first one included the patients with well-controlled bronchial asthma without nasal polyps and with self-reported
good tolerance to NSAIDs, and the second group included patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria with selfreported good tolerance to NSAIDs. Thanks to these control groups we could assess if higher ELR was characteristic only for NERD patients or for the whole group of
patients with asthma, and in parallel, we looked if lower
PLR was typical only for urticaria exacerbated by NSAIDs
(NECD) or also for another type of urticaria, namely
chronic spontaneous urticaria.

The higher ELR in NERD patients than in NECD,
NIUA, and SNIUAA patients and then control groups CAST and C-CSU seems to be easy to explain. Most patients with NERD have nasal polyps associated with eo

were significantly higher in NERD patients than in others. Thus, higher ELR may simply result from NERD
pathophysiology. The important and practical finding of
our study is that the ELR was significantly higher in paients with NERD but not in asthma without polyps and
with normal tolerance to NSAIDs. If we know the cutoff
value of ELR value characteristic for NERD, it will be
helpful in initially distinguishing patients with asthma
with unclear clinical history of NSAID hypersensitivity
before performing DPT. However, we could bear in mind
hat there are patients with bronchial asthma and nasal
polyps with good tolerance to NSAIDs; thus, our results
should also be compared with this group of asthmatic paients in future.

More difficult to explain is lower PLR in NECD than
in other types of NSAID hypersensitivity. The absolute
number and percentage of platelets and lymphocytes
were comparable among all types of NSAID hypersensitivity [24, 25]. In our study, most patients with NECD also

tomatic at the time of the study. Patients did not have
other autoimmune disease that could affect the number
of platelets in the blood. Data on the role of platelets in
chronic urticaria are conflicting. In patients with chronic
urticaria and hypersensitivity to acetylic acid (ASA),
platelet activation was increased as compared with urticaria patients tolerating ASA [25]. However, the results of
studies on platelet indices such as mean platelet volume,
platelet count, and distribution width, as well as markers
of platelet aggregation in chronic urticaria, were equivocal. We compared the PLR values in NECD patients with
patients with CSU-C and found statistically lower PLR
values only in NECD patients. Thus, low PLR values seem
to be characteristic for NECD patients and may be a clinically helpful tool in management of patients with chronic urticaria and unclear tolerance to NSAIDs, particularly
while considering dietary restrictions. However, this phenomenon needs further investigations with larger groups
of patients with NECD and CSU. It should be underlined
that no patients with CSU had positive ANA results.

The usefulness of ELR, NLR, and PLR has not yet been
studied in hypersensitivity to NSAIDs and neither in hypersensitivity to other drugs. However, the NLR, ELR,
and PLR were assessed in other allergic diseases. Mochimaru et al. [18] reported the correlation between the NLR
and increased probability for an episode of severe asthma
exacerbation within the next year. Gungen and Aydemir
[19] reported positive correlation of the NLR in patients
with controlled asthma and with state of uncontrolled
asthma. Yenigun et al. [20] reported correlation between
the ELR and allergic rhinitis with positive skin prick tests
in children. In some studies, the means of NLR and ELR
were significantly higher in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) whose disease recurred than in those remaining disease-free after surgery
[15]. Moreover, the mean ELR was significantly higher in
patients with CRSwNP with other clinical conditions
such as (allergy, asthma, and ASA intolerance) and with
recurrence of the disease than in patients without allergies [15]. Other data came from studies in different immunologically mediated diseases. Gasparyan et al. [14]
summarized publications on the PLR in rheumatic disease and reported positive correlation between exacerbation of rheumatic disease and PLR and decrease in the
PLR in response to anti-inflammatory therapies. In other

diseases such as cancer processes or with atherosclerotic
background and in some chronic diseases [6-10], the usefulness of the NLR has been confirmed.

Moreover, in our study the correlations between the
ratios and CRP were calculated. CRP did not significantly
differ among patients with various type of NSAID hypersensitivity, but its value correlated only with the NLR in
the whole group of patients. This observation may suggest
that the NLR together with CRP may be an auxiliary laboratory tool while neutrophilic inflammation is suspected.

There are some limitations of our study. First, the population sizes of groups with individual types of hypersensitivity to NSAIDs were relatively small. It makes impossible to assess the cutoff value of ELR and PLR and sensitivity and specificity in relation to data from the interview
and the result of DPT in false-positive and false-negative
patients.

The strengths of this study are that only the patients
with proper diagnosis of hypersensitivity to NSAIDs
based on the medical history and DPT were included into
the study. Of special importance is the fact that their comorbid chronic diseases and chronic or acute infections
which could affect NLR, ELR, or PLR values were exclusion criteria. The influence of systemically used drugs was
excluded as well.

On the other hand, strict exclusion criteria may be a
drawback of our project as in real life most patients with
NSAID hypersensitivity have coexisting diseases that can
influence the CBC ratios Thus, while interpreting the
CBC ratios, the possible changes of them caused by other
diseases should be taken into consideration.

One can assume that the ELR in NERD and the PLR in
NECD could be used as a helpful indicator although it will
probably not replace the diagnostic gold standard of drug
hypersensitivity workup, that is, DPT. Further studies
covering more numerous groups of patients are warranted in order to establish the diagnostic value of ELR and
PLR in NSAID hypersensitivity. The most valuable results of our study seem to be the finding on higher ELR in
NERD than in NSAID-tolerated asthma and in lower values of PLR in NECD than in CSU as they both may have
practical application.

Conclusions

The ELR and PLR may be helpful in differentiating
various types of hypersensitivity to NSAIDs and in some
allergic diseases with good NSAID tolerance. The NLR
seems not to be useful in this field. However, further studies with larger patient groups are required to confirm our
initial findings.
