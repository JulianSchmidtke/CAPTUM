Abstract

Omalizumab is approved for use in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU); however, it is not approved for chronic inducible
urticaria (ClndU). The aim of the present study was to assess
the effectiveness of omalizumab in treating CSU and ClndU in
Italy. This is a multicentre prospective observational real-life
study involving patients with severe urticaria capable of undergoing omalizumab therapy. We enrolled 127 patients
(59.1% females), ranging in age from 15 to 83 years, 69.3%
had CSU alone, 26.8% had CSU and ClndU, and 3.9% had only
CindU (30.8% delayed pressure, 35.9% dermographic, 15.3%
cholinergic, 12.8% cold, 5.1% aquagenic). After the first cycle
of omalizumab (300 mg every 4 weeks for 24 weeks), 16 CSU
patients and 10 patients (20.5%) with ClndU with or without

CSU did not require a second cycle of omalizumab (300 mg
every 4 weeks for 20 weeks). The patient with aquagenic urticaria achieved remission after the first cycle. None showed a
lack of response to the second cycle of omalizumab. Omalizumab is a promising drug for both spontaneous and inducible chronic urticaria. Current evidence indicates that omalizumab may be approved also for ClndU.

Introduction

Chronic urticaria (CU) represents a complex clinical
pathological entity consisting of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU)
[1]. Despite the common manifestations including itch,
wheals and/or angioedema that last for more than 6

weeks, these entities are triggered by different stimuli and
display different pathogenic mechanisms [1]. Furthermore, CIndU has been demonstrated to be a predictor of
severe CSU [2].

The treatment guidelines for chronic urticaria start
with H, antihistamines, which can be increased up to
fourfold the standard dosage [3]. However, some patients
do not respond, requiring additional therapy [3].

Nowadays, omalizumab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody, is considered to be the gold standard in ani-histamine-resistant patients with urticaria. However,
while omalizumab has been approved for treating paients with CSU, the use for CIndU remains nonapproved.
To date, the majority of evidence for omalizumab use in
CIndU stems from case reports and case studies, with
only three phase II studies; however, evidence for therapeutic efficacy and safety has been promising [4-6].
Furthermore, despite one decade of experience in
managing eosinophilic asthma with omalizumab, its application for urticaria has started only recently. This realife prospective observational study was designated in order to evaluate the efficacy of omalizumab in a multicenre cohort of patients seen at the dermatology-allergology
outpatient clinic.

Materials and Methods

This is a multicentre prospective observational real-life study
involving patients with severe urticaria, who fulfil the criteria for
omalizumab use, and are seen at one of the three university centres
(Galeazzi Hospital in Milan, Policlinico in Milan and Department
of Dermatology in Ancona). The current dosage criteria for omalizumab in Italy is 300 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks in patients
who (1) are aged >12 years, (2) have a urticarial activity score
(UAS) of >3 or a UAS7 (urticarial activity score over 7 days) >16,
and (3) are unresponsive to a 4 times increased dosage of antihistamines [7, 8]. The treatment is administered over two cycles; the
first one is 24 weeks, followed by an 8-week “wait and see” period,
after which the second cycle is administered for 20 weeks [8]. Additional treatment cycles are considered not approved use, in apparent contradiction with the chronic behaviour of CU. CIndU
patients previously unresponsive to the approved treatments were
shifted to the not approved use of omalizumab. Patients with a history of urticaria longer than 6 weeks and unresponsive to antihistamines from September 2015 to June 2017 were recruited. All patients kept an electronic diary using the Orticaria app (Version 1.3,
Novartis Farma S.p.a.) in order to homogenize recorded items,
namely age, gender, UAS7, Dermatologic Quality of Life index,
wheels location and number [9]. The UAS7 score was used to categorize patients into four groups: urticaria-free (UAS = 0, complete response), well controlled disease (UAS7 = 1-6 points; optimal response), mild urticaria (UAS7 = 7-15 points; partial response), moderate and severe urticaria (UAS7 = 16-27 and >27
points; non-response).

Results

We enrolled 127 patients (59.1% females), ranging in
age from 15 to 83 years (Table 1). The mean duration of
disease was 52 + 65.7 months (range 6-540), and urticaria was present in 96% of our patient cohort for more
than 1 year, and more than 5 years in 53% of the cases.
Our sample was characterized by 69.3% CSU alone, 26.8%
CSU and CIndU, and 3.9% only CIndU. In detail, CIndU
patients were divided into 30.8% delayed pressure, 3.9%
dermographic, 15.3% cholinergic, 12.8% cold, and 5.1%
aquagenic. Atopy as presence of atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma or allergic rhinitis or constitutional eczema
was found in 22.8% of patients. Autologous serum skin
test and autologous plasma skin test were positive in
28.3%. Furthermore, antithyroid peroxidase antibodies
were present in 14.2% of patients. In addition to H, antihistamines, 62% of our cohort previously used short
course corticosteroids, 18.1% montelukast, 13.4% cyclosporine, and 5.5% others. All CU patients displayed a
UAS7 of more than 27 before starting the omalizumab
therapy. Among all CU patients, 8.7% had a UAS7 of >27,
19.7% 16-27, 29.1% 7-15, 26% 1-6, and 16.5% 0 points

after the first months of therapy (Fig. 1). A second cycle
of omalizumab was not needed in 25 patients (Fig. 1).
Furthermore, 77.1% of CU patients who underwent a second cycle of therapy achieved optimal (UAS7 = 1-6) or
complete response (Fig. 1).

Of those with CSU, 86.4% of patients experienced optimal response (UAS7 = 1-6), or complete response, and

after the second cycle only 18.4% had mild or moderate
urticaria (Fig. 2). Notably after the first cycle, 15 CSU patients did not require further omlizumab treatment
(Fig. 2).

Regarding patients with CIndU, 82% obtained optimal
(UAS7 = 1-6) or complete response after the first cycle of
omalizumab and 10 patients did not require another cycle

72.4% of the remaining patients obtained an optimal

Discussion

Omalizumab has previously been proven safe and efficacious in CSU [10], and our data replicate prior findings. Despite the fact that omalizumab is used off label for
CIndU, there are several case reports and trials that demonstrate its therapeutic efficacy [11]. In this study, we observed that, after the first cycle, 10 patients with CIndU
did not require a second cycle of omalizumab. Since the
first reported case of efficacy in CIndU, omalizumab was
regarded as a possible therapeutic solution in inducible
urticaria [12]. Furthermore, prior evidence for the use of
omalizumab in CIndU which consisted mostly of small
case series, also demonstrated a safe and effective profile
[11]. Recently, Maurer et al. [11] reviewed omalizumab
use for CIndU and found limited evidence for use in cold
urticaria, symptomatic dermographism and solar urticaria. Little evidence is present in regard to aquagenic and
vibratory urticaria. Interestingly, in our sample both patients with aquagenic urticaria responded to omalizumab. Another necessary pitfall for evaluating evidence for
omalizumab use in CindU patients were heterogeneous

dosages, which did not allow a precise comparison of
clinical responses [11]. The rapid response to omalizumab in CIndU patients was in line with the literature and
during the second cycle all patients achieved a complete
response [11]. In the literature, the co-occurrence of
CIndU and CSU is attested from 4 to 76% [13] and is
currently interpreted as a negative prognostic factor of
severe urticaria [7, 14]. Current evidence highlights that
(a) upon interrupting omalizumab therapy after the end
of the cycles a significant number of patients re-experienced urticaria, (b) urticaria is an umbrella term that encloses several clinical entities with different pathogeneses,
(c) omalizumab is an effective drug for controlling
CIndU with or without CSU, and (d) aquagenic urticaria
may benefit from omalizumab.

Our results suggest that the treatment of CSU in patients with inducible urticaria can improve the response
of CindU and can lead to remission of both diseases. Additionally, we observed remission in 10 CIndU patients
(62, 5%) with or without CSU (only 2 patients have isolated dermographic urticaria). In conclusion, our sample
displayed a safe and effective profile in patients with
chronic urticaria, and no debilitative side effects occur
during the observation period. In combination with prior
studies and current evidence, the authors suggest treating
patients with CU, both CSU and CIndU, continuously
with omalizumab; however, further studies are mandatory to optimize evidence.
