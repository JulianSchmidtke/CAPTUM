Platelet oxidative stress and systemic
inflammation in chronic spontaneous urticaria

Abstract

Background: Recent studies implicate the role of immuneinflammatory responses in chronic spontaneous urticaria
(CSU). Although it is well known that platelets release
inflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species
upon activation, their role in CSU is poorly characterized.
The present study was designed to evaluate platelet oxidative stress [platelet malondialdehyde (MDA), platelet
superoxide dismutase (SOD), platelet glutathione peroxidase (GPx)] and systemic inflammatory markers [plasma
Interleukin-6 (IL-6), high sensitivity C-reactive protein
(hs-CRP)] in patients with CSU and their association with
disease severity.

Methods: Forty-five patients with CSU and 45 age- and
gender-matched healthy controls were included in the
study. Severity grading was completed according to the
urticaria severity score (USS). Autologous plasma skin test
(APST) was done in all patients with CSU. Platelet MDA,
SOD and GPx and inflammatory markers plasma IL-6 and
hs-CRP were assayed in all study participants.

Results: In patients with CSU, platelet SOD and GPx
were significantly lowered, while platelet MDA levels
were significantly elevated in comparison to healthy controls. Both IL-6 and hs-CRP were significantly elevated
in patients with CSU and correlated with platelet oxidative stress parameters (p<0.05). Platelet MDA, SOD and
GPx and inflammatory markers (plasma IL-6 and hs-CRP)
showed a significant correlation with USS in patients
with CSU.

Conclusions: Our results indicate significant systemic
inflammation and platelet oxidative stress in patients
with CSU.

Keywords: chronic spontaneous urticaria; glutathione peroxidase; high sensitivity C- reactive protein; interleukin-6;

Introduction

The origin of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) to a
great extent is unknown till date. In some cases, autoimmune etiology has been proposed. There is increasing evidence to prove that some skin diseases, including urticaria,
are mediated by oxidative stress, which is caused by the
imbalance between productions of highly reactive oxygen
species (ROS) and endogenous protective enzymatic and
non-enzymatic antioxidants [1]. The role of oxidative stress
in the pathogenesis of physical urticaria [2] and chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) [1, 3-5], has been studied previously,
but the results have been contradictory. These studies have
evaluated oxidative stress in plasma [4], lesional skin [3],
and in erythrocytes [1, 2, 5]. Platelets have been described
as a source of inflammatory mediators that are implicated
in histamine release from basophils and mast cells [6].
However, the role of platelets is poorly characterized in urticaria and the possible significance of platelets in urticaria
may be related to their pro-inflammatory properties [6].

There are various studies which report that platelets
release ROS upon activation and these ROS have been
found to influence the activation and degranulation of
basophils and mast cells [3, 4]. However, there are no published studies to date in English literature on platelet oxidative stress in CSU.

 

 

It has also been seen that concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)
1790 —— Rajappa et al.: Platelet oxidative stress and chronic spontaneous urticaria

are elevated in patients with severe chronic urticaria as
compared to those with mild disease. However, it is not
clear whether this is an epiphenomenon or contributes
to disease pathogenesis [7]. It is well known that oxidative stress and inflammation are intimately linked to each
other. We also would like to study the association between
platelet oxidative stress and systemic inflammation.
Hence, the purpose of the present research was to
evaluate and compare the platelet oxidative stress and
systemic inflammatory markers in patients with CSU with
that of age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects.

Materials and methods

This was a hospital-based, cross sectional study with 45 patients with
CSU and 45 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. This study
was approved by the Institute Ethics Committee (Human Studies),
JIPMER, Puducherry, India (Approved as project number EC/2011/1/4
vide letter no. IEC No.EC/2011/1/4 dated 25 April, 2011) and written
informed consent was obtained from all study subjects, prior to participation in the study. This study was conducted in accordance with
the guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 1983.

Study population

Patients with CSU, characterized by the presence of continuous or
recurrent wheals with or without angioedema for >6 weeks duration
of age ranging between 18 and 40 years, attending the dermatology
outpatient department of our institute were included as cases in our
study. Age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers were recruited
as controls.

The exclusion criteria for cases and controls were the following: acute urticaria, age <18 years and >40 years, on any medication for the past 3 months other than anti-histamines which had to
be stopped for 1 week prior, physical urticarias, urticarial vasculitis,
pregnant women, obesity (BMI >25 kg/m’), dyslipidemia, diabetes,
pre-existing cardiovascular disease, hypertension, smokers, deep
vein thrombosis, cerebro-vascular accidents, malignancies, hepatic
and renal disease, inflammatory cutaneous disorders, vitiligo and
infections.

Clinical work-up

A detailed history was taken and clinical examination was done in
all patients with CSU. The disease severity was assessed using the
urticaria severity score (USS) [8]. Hemogram, urinalysis, filarial serology, stool parasites, blood glucose (fasting and post prandial), serum
lipids, serum creatinine, liver function tests and thyroid stimulating
hormone levels were done routinely for all patients with CSU. Autologous plasma skin test (APST) was done in all patients with CSU to
screen for autoreactivity. This intradermal skin test using 0.05 mL of
citrated autologous plasma was done as described by Asero et al. [9]
after stopping anti-histamines for a week. Those with a positive APST
were diagnosed to have autoimmune urticaria.

DE GRUYTER

Blood sampling for estimation of platelet oxidative stress was
done, when patients had active urticarial episodes. Five milliliters of
venous blood was drawn from the antecubital vein, following light
application of a tourniquet, after a fasting period of 12 h. The initial
3 mL was collected in ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) containing tubes for isolation of platelets using the standardized protocol of Erel et al. [10]. The remaining 2 mL was transferred and mixed
immediately, avoiding frothing into plastic tubes containing sodium
citrate and the citrated plasma was stored at —-80°C for measurement
of IL-6 [R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA] and hs-CRP [Diagnostics Biochem Canada Inc. (DBC), Ontario, Canada] by ELISA.

The platelet count was estimated using the automated cell counter (Sysmex XT-1800i, US). Following this, a part of the platelet suspension was enriched with 0.02% butyl hydroxyl toluene to inhibit
spontaneous oxidation and was used for the determination of lipid
peroxidation level of platelets. The remaining part of the platelet
suspension was transferred into a polypropylene centrifuge tube and
frozen at -80°C until enzyme measurement. Lipid peroxidation level
of the platelets was assayed by the measurement of malondialdehyde
(MDA) by high performance liquid chromatography (SP-20A Shimadzu prominence HPLC system-Shimadzu scientific instruments,
Japan), using the method standardized by Agarwal and Chase [11].
For the enzyme assays, the samples were left at 4°C until they thawed
completely, and were then disrupted by sonication. The platelet
sonicates were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 30 min and SOD and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels were assayed in the supernatants
using commercially available kits (Randox Laboratories Ltd, UK).
Microprotein level was measured by Lowry method [12]. All these
assays were done in duplicate and their means were computed to
increase the reliability of the measurements.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS statistics version
20 for Windows. Baseline characteristics of cases and controls were
analyzed using descriptive statistics. The normality of continuous
data was assessed by Kolmogrov-Smirnov test. The normally distributed data were described as mean + standard deviation and compared by independent student’s t-test. Mann-Whitney U-test was used
for non-parametric data. The levels of the various markers of platelet oxidative stress were correlated with USS, using Spearman’s rank
correlation test. Pearson’s correlation was used to assess correlation
between the levels of oxidative stress parameters with inflammatory
markers and platelet counts. Analysis was carried out at 5% level of
significance and p<0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

Results

There were no significant differences between cases and
controls in their baseline characteristics. The mean duration of CSU was 24.69+27 months. The mean time since the
last attack of wheals was 2.29+3.23 days.

Platelet MDA was found to be significantly increased
and SOD and GPx levels were significantly decreased in
patients with CSU, in comparison to controls (p<0.0001)

(Figure 1). Platelet MDA showed a significant negative correlation with platelet antioxidant enzymes SOD (r=-0.320,
p=0.000) and GPx (r=-0.402, p=0.000).

Plasma hs-CRP and IL-6 were significantly elevated in
patients with CSU in comparison to controls (p<0.0001)
(Figure 2). There was a significant positive correlation
between these inflammatory markers and platelet oxidative stress (Table 1). The total platelet count was significantly decreased in patients with CSU, when compared
to controls (p<0.0001) (Figure 1). The platelet counts did
not correlate with the levels of platelet MDA (p=0.980),
platelet SOD (p=0.679), platelet GPx (p=0.766), hs-CRP
(p=0.738), IL-6 (p=0.690) and USS (p=0.890).

Among the 45 patients, 27 were positive for APST.
USS was significantly higher in the APST positive group
in comparison to the APST negative group (Table 2). There
were no significant differences in platelet counts, platelet MDA and platelet SOD levels between the two groups.
However, the platelet GPx levels and plasma IL-6 and
hs-CRP were significantly higher in the APST positive

levels. (C) Comparison of platelet SOD levels. (D) Comparison of

It was also seen that mean plasma IL-6 and hs-CRP levels
were significantly elevated in the APST negative group in
comparison to controls.

The mean USS among patients with CSU was
4.27+41.72. Eighteen patients had a lower USS (0-3) and
27 patients had a higher USS (4-6). USS correlated positively with platelet oxidative stress markers and systemic
inflammatory markers (Table 3). In both the APST-positive
and -negative groups, the USS showed a significant positive correlation with platelet GPx, plasma hs-CRP and IL-6
levels. However, no significant associations were observed
for platelet MDA and SOD (Table 4).

inflammation associated with disturbed cytokine production have been described in chronic urticaria [7]. IL-6 is a
pro-inflammatory cytokine which plays a vital role in promoting systemic inflammation and increasing the hs-CRP
levels [13-16]. It has also been observed that hs-CRP and
IL-6 levels are elevated in CSU and correlate with the disease
severity [15, 16] which was also seen in the present study.
The alteration in oxidant/antioxidant homeostasis
has been reported in patients with cold and solar urticaria. Probably the imbalance reflects the altered cytokine
production or activation of a complement pathway and
could be a common biochemical basis for increased skin
susceptibility to external stimuli in physical urticaria
patients [2]. The reported data in cases of CIU have been
conflicting. Sagdic et al. [5] in a recent study on oxidative
stress in red blood cells (RBC) in CIU reported a significant
difference in RBC SOD activity, but no difference in RBC
MDA levels and GPx activity between patients with CIU
and controls. In the study of Raho et al. [3], the activity
of SOD and the levels of MDA were increased in lesional
skin samples from CIU patients, as compared with skin
samples from both non-lesional CIU patients, and healthy
controls. Kasperska-Zajac et al. [1] reported no differences

in plasma and RBC SOD, GPX, MDA and catalase levels
between cases of CIU and controls. There was no difference among APST positive and APST negative patients.

Cassano et al. [4] reported that there was a marked
increase of both platelet ROS levels and plasma SOD
activity between patients with CIU and controls at baseline, and treatment with desloratadine caused a relevant
reduction of ROS levels and SOD activity. In the present
study, SOD and GPx in platelets of patients with CSU
were significantly lowered in comparison to controls,
while platelet MDA levels were significantly elevated. It
is difficult to compare our observations with the above
studies, as we estimated the platelet oxidative stress
(as measured by platelet MDA and platelet antioxidant
enzymes) in patients with CSU, which has not been
reported before.

In the present study, platelet MDA and antioxidant
enzymes (SOD and GPx) significantly correlated with USS
in patients with CSU. SOD is an important anti-oxidant
enzyme, having an antitoxic effect against super oxide
anion. GPx, an oxidative stress inducible enzyme, plays
a significant role in the peroxyl scavenging mechanism.
The induction of the antioxidant enzymes, especially GPx,
in severe urticaria may be a compensatory regulation in
response to increased oxidative stress in severe urticaria
[4]. These observations point to significant oxidative stress
in the platelets of patients with CSU, which increases with
increasing severity of the disease.

It is well known that both oxidative stress and inflammation are intimately linked to each other and their
association has been established in many disorders like
diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, carcinogenesis, etc. Increase in oxidative stress can increase

the production of inflammatory cytokines and likewise,
an increase in inflammatory cytokines can stimulate the
production of free radicals [17]. We also found that all
these three platelet oxidative stress parameters significantly correlated with plasma IL-6 and hs-CRP levels. In
addition, platelet GPx, plasma IL-6 and hs-CRP positively
correlated with USS, both in the APST-positive and -negative groups. This indicates that more severe the urticaria,

Autoimmune urticaria is associated with an increased
severity, when compared to non-autoimmune urticaria
[14]. In the present study also, USS was significantly higher
in the APST-positive group as compared to the APST-negative group. There were no significant differences in platelet MDA and platelet SOD levels between the two groups.
However, significant differences were noted in respect to
platelet GPx, plasma IL-6 and hs-CRP levels in the APSTpositive group, in comparison to the APST-negative group.
It was also seen that the levels of the inflammatory biomarkers were significantly higher in the APST-negative
group in comparison to controls. Although Asero et al. [9]
have reported higher hs-CRP levels in APST-positive individuals, they observed no differences between the APSTnegative group and controls. Our observation shows that
inflammation occurs in both the groups, but is higher in
the autoreactive group

In the present study, we observed patients with CSU
to have a decreased mean platelet count, when compared

the platelet counts in patients with autoimmune urticaria and non-autoimmune urticaria as also observed
by Magen et al. [14]. The platelet counts did not correlate
with the USS and the level of the oxidative stress markers
or inflammatory markers. This may probably be due to
role of other cells like mast cells and basophils contributing to inflammation and oxidative stress in addition to
platelets.

The present study involved only 90 study subjects
(45 patients with CSU and 45 age- and gender-matched
healthy controls), hence, a larger sample size would have
further validated the results of the study.

Our results indicate that CSU is associated with significant platelet oxidative stress and systemic inflammation. Markers of oxidative stress in platelets and systemic
inflammation correlate well with the severity of disease
in patients with CSU. These observations provide new
insights into the pathogenesis of CSU, thereby opening up
new avenues for the management of this often challenging
condition.
