Abstract Acute urticaria is defined as evanescent wheals
with a duration period of up to 6 weeks. Yet within acute
urticaria, IgE-mediated urticaria lasts rarely more than 48 h,
whereas longer duration periods are frequently unfruitful
with respect to diagnostic work-up. We hypothesize the
differences in immunologic features in immediate type urticaria versus prolonged acute urticaria within the model of
Anisakis simplex (A. simplex) sensitization-associated urticaria. We included 57 patients with gastro-allergic Anisakiasis (GAA) and urticaria duration of less than 48 h and 17
patients with A. simplex sensitization-associated prolonged
acute urticaria (PROL), defined as urticaria duration
between 3 days and 6 weeks. As control group served 23
patients with A. simplex sensitization-associated chronic
urticaria (CU+). We compared total IgE as well as specific
IgE, IgG and IgG, against A. simplex. Median total IgE was
higher in GAA than in PROL or CU+ [442 (interquartile
range, IQR 198-995) vs. 117 (68-261) or 251 (94—
382) kU/I, respectively]. Median-specific IgE was higher in
GAA than in PROL or CU+ [62 (IQR 24.1-99) vs. 12.3
(6-30.9) or 14.2 (6.2-44.9) kU/, respectively]. The differences were statistically significant at P< 0.001 for GAA
against PROL and at P<0.003 for GAA against CU+.
Also, specific IgG and IgG, levels were higher in GAA
than in PROL or CU+ at the same significance level. The
levels of total IgE or specific immunoglobulin isotypes
were not significantly different between PROL and CU+. In
the model of A. simplex sensitization-associated urticaria,
immediate-type urticaria in GAA is immunologically

different from prolonged acute urticaria, which, in turn,
shows features nearer to chronic urticaria than to gastroallergic Anisakiasis. Thus, in an allergological evaluation
of urticaria, we propose a possible benefit of a distinction of
the duration period at 48 h, and not 6 weeks, when differentiating acute versus chronic urticaria.

Introduction

Urticaria comprises a wide range of intermittent wheal
reactions, from dermographism to physical, cholinergic or
ordinary urticaria. When the reaction is mediated by immunological mechanisms, mainly IgE, the term has been proposed to be allergic urticaria [10]. Urticaria is defined as
chronic if spontaneously occurring wheals are present for at
least 6 weeks [13]. It seems that chronic versus acute urticaria has been mainly differentiated in order to facilitate
guidelines on diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Yet it is
not quite clear, when this separation began. Whereas in a
1964 paper in the British Medical Journal, Calnan states
that “the clinician separates these patients into acute and
chronic, the distinction being made arbitrarily by the duration period, varying from one to six months or more...”, in

a 1967 study on the effect of salicylates on urticaria in the
same journal, we found the first published definition of
chronic urticaria if “it is present for at least 6 weeks”
[3, 11]. Thus, acute urticaria comprises the range of evanescent, recurring wheals lasting up to 6 weeks.

It is interesting to note that, whereas chronic urticaria is
autoimmune or idiopathic in most cases, in acute urticaria
we find two types of possible aetiology. In short lived urticaria lasting only several hours up to 24 or 48 h, IgE-mediated allergic reactions can frequently be found due to food,
drugs, insects or other eliciting allergens, whereas in longer
lasting urticaria 48h up to 6 weeks (from now on prolonged acute urticaria), the work-up for an aetiology is difficult and remains, besides a possible infectious setting, often
unfruitful [13]. It is thus surprising, that in the classification
of urticaria according to chronicity, a separation has been
accorded on 6 weeks, whereas allergists are aware that a
real significant difference in diagnostic rentability could be
gained by setting the threshold at 24-48 h.

In this study, we therefore aimed to analyse if we could
confirm differences in immunologic features in acute short
lived (immediate type IgE-mediated) versus prolonged
acute urticaria within the model of Anisakis simplex
(A. simplex) sensitization-associated urticaria. Urticaria in
gastro-allergic Anisakiasis (GAA) accompanies the acute
parasitism when the third-stage larva of A. simplex penetrates
the gastric mucosa [5]. This IgE-mediated allergic urticaria
rarely exceeds 24-48 h of duration. On the other side, the sensitization against A. simplex in a group of chronic urticaria
patients is also postulated to be due to a parasitic contact in at
least a subgroup of patients with detectable specific IgG, [8,
9]. Our hypothesis was, that immediate-type IgE-mediated
urticaria in GAA would differ from PROL with respect to the
studied immunoglobulin levels.

Methods

We included 57 patients with GAA and urticaria duration
of less than 48 h, 17 patients with A. simplex sensitizationassociated prolonged acute urticaria (PROL), defined as
urticaria duration between 3 days and 6 weeks. As a control
group served 23 patients with A. simplex sensitization-associated chronic urticaria (CU+). Patients were included in
both acute urticaria groups if a raw or undercooked fishmeal was suspected in the initiation of the symptoms and in
the CU+ group if they consumed habitually raw or undercooked fish and displayed a positive skin prick test (SPT)
against A. simplex. Due to the clinical definition of GAA,
patients with GAA and PROL began their urticaria within
24 h after intake of the suspected fishmeal [5].

All patients were assessed for sensitization against
A. simplex by SPT against crude extract of A. simplex.

Patients were excluded from this study if they had other
conditions associated with further possible causes of urticaria: all patients were assessed for other IgE-mediated
food allergies by SPT test against a set of food-agents,
including egg, milk, fish and vegetables. Further, drug
allergy or acute infection was ruled out by history.

In all patients, we analysed total IgE as well as specific
IgG, IgG, and IgE (CAP-PHADIA) against A. simplex. As
specific immunoglobulin levels decrease continuously after
the initial polyclonal expansion due to the acute parasitic
event, blood extraction was performed between the second
and fourth month after the acute reaction or onset of symptoms [4, 6].

Patients with PROL and CU+ were further assessed
serologically for Hepatitis B or C infection and anti-thyroid
antibodies. These conditions were not excluded from this
study, as even conscious of these being associated with
chronic urticaria, the inclusion criteria with respect to raw
fish intake and a positive IgE against A. simplex, gave sufficient power to associate the urticarial reaction with a previous parasitic episode. Otherwise, patients were excluded
from CU+ if they showed signs of physical urticaria.

This retrospective study was approved by the local Ethics committee.

Results

Mean age was 45.8 years (SD 15.3) and mean latency to
blood extraction was 2.6 months (SD 0.7) without statistically significant differences between the three groups. The
proportion of males was 42% in GAA, 24% in PROL and
13/% in CU+ (P = 0.03). Median duration of PROL was
7 days (IQR 4-15).

One patient in PROL and one in CU+ had previous nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug-intolerance reaction with
urticaria. One patient in PROL and three patients in CU+
had a positive Hepatitis B serology without signs of active
infection, and two patients in CU+ were under treatment
with thyroxine due to hypothyroidism without autoimmune
thyroiditis.

Total IgE was higher in GAA than in PROL or CU+
[442 (IQR 198-995) vs. 117 (68-261) or 251 (94-382) kU/
1, respectively]. Specific IgE was higher in GAA than in
PROL or CU+ [62 (IQR 24.1-99) vs. 12.3 (6-30.9) or 14.2
(6.2-44.9) kU, respectively]. Specific IgG was higher in
GAA than in PROL or CU+ [20 (IQR 11-40) vs. 11
(5-15.5) or 10.5 (5.3-17.8) mg/ml]. Specific IgG, was
higher in GAA than in PROL or CU+ [2,339 (IQR 1,0485,102) vs. 372 (198-675) or 1,059 (87.5-1896) mg/l,
respectively]. All these differences were statistically significant at P< 0.001 for GAA against PROL and at P < 0.003
for GAA against CU+. The levels of total IgE or specific

Discussion

GAA is a clinical entity, where urticaria, angioedema or
anaphylaxis accompanies the acute gastric parasitism by
the live fish-nematode A. simplex Allergic symptoms are
acute in their duration and rarely exceed 24-48 h [1, 5].
Specific IgE can be detected in all patients and the eliciting
allergens have been postulated to belong to the excretory—
secretory proteins, released by the live larva in the moment
of penetration through the gastric mucosa [2, 5]. Otherwise,
several studies have also highlighted the association of a
distinct chronic urticaria phenotype in patients with sensitization against this nematode [8, 9]. The duration of chronic

urticaria seems to be shorter than in other chronic ordinary
urticaria forms. The pathogenetic mechanism by which the
urticarial reaction remains chronic in these patients remains
unclear, but the by far higher sensitization prevalence in
chronic urticaria patients with respect to the general population underlines the suspicion that A. simplex could be
partly responsible in the aetiology. In this sense, a subgroup
of these CU+ patients with detectable IgG4 had been identified with a previous parasitic episode [8].

Sensitization against A. simplex has mainly been interpreted as a witness of a previous parasitic contact with the
live larva. Thus, different urticaria forms are associated
with parasitism by A. simplex, this being an interesting
model for studying epidemiologic, clinical or immunologic
features. In a recent report we confirmed raw fish eating
habits as a risk factor for GAA and CU+, but the frequency
of raw fish intake was associated with different chronicity
of urticaria [7].

In the present study we were able to analyse immunologic features, not only in GAA and CU+, but also in an
intermediate group of patients with urticaria, whose total
intermittent wheal duration was less than 6 weeks (PROL).
By traditional definition the latter group is still considered
as acute urticaria, but as the urticaria duration is longer than
48 h, does not fit to an immediate-type IgE-mediated urticaria as in GAA.

Our results confirm the expected distinct immunological
features in GAA versus PROL. More importantly, we could
not find any differences in immunoglobulin levels between
PROL and CU. This fact is interesting in the context of the
above discussion on the traditional 6 weeks separation for
differentiating acute from chronic urticaria: PROL is clearly
nearer to CU+ than to GAA in its immunologic features.
Whereas the pathomechanism of PROL or CU+ remains
unclear, this study, together with the fact that CU+ is often
only of some months duration, encourages us to consider
both as the same clinical entity with a different duration,
only separated by an arbitrary definition of 6 weeks.

Specific immunoglobulin levels have previously been
reported to be lower in CU+ than in GAA, a fact that we
corroborate in this study. The main confounding aspect is
the time elapsed between the last parasitic episode and the
obtaining of the serum sample. This feature has to be rigorously considered if analysing immunoglobulin levels, as
previous reports have shown that after an initial polyclonal
stimulation, immunoglobulin levels descend continuously
afterwards [6]. Therefore, all serum samples were taken
with a known and clear-cut time interval after the beginning
of the urticaria. Whereas in GAA the acute urticaria corresponds to the exact moment of the parasitic contact, it is not
known if the same applies for CU+ and PROL, or if longer
time intervals have to be suspected between the parasitic
episode and the onset of symptoms and could thus be the
reason for the lower immunoglobulin levels. Another previ
cay Springer

ously cited possibility is that the lower immunoglobulin
levels, especially of IgG, are directly associated with the
pathogenesis of the chronicity of the urticarial reaction [8].

Whereas a clear urticaria eliciting factor in the form of a
raw or undercooked fish-meal can be detected in our GAA
and PROL group, one limitation of our study is the difficulty to ascribe a clear eliciting fishmeal in relationship to
the onset of our CU+ patients. We cannot rule out the possibility of sensitization resulting from frequent contact with
parasite antigens without infection in some of the CU+
patients. Otherwise, the inclusion criteria in our study with
obligate raw fish-eating habits are highly compatible with
previous contact with live larva [12].

Taken together, the model of A. simplex parasitism and
its relationship with distinct urticaria phenotypes (acute,
chronic) is an interesting approach for the study of the pathogenesis of some chronic urticaria forms. Further, in this
model, when defining acute versus chronic urticaria, we
propose a possible benefit of a distinction of the duration
period at 48 h, and not 6 weeks. It is possible that the diagnostic work-up of urticaria of other immunologically mediated aetiologies will benefit from this differentiation.
