Keywords Abstract
angiogenesis; asthma; autoreactivity;

coagulation; inflammation. Background: Patients with nonallergic asthma frequently show autoreactivity as do

subjects with chronic urticaria (CU). Activation of the coagulation cascade and
hyper-expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were recently found
in CU, and there is sparse evidence that the same may occur in asthma.

Objective: To investigate autoreactivity, activation of the coagulation cascade, and
expression of VEGF in patients with nonallergic asthma.

Methods: Twenty-one adults with nonallergic asthma underwent autologous plasma
skin test (APST) and the measurement of plasma levels of the prothrombin fragment Fl+2, D-dimer, VEGF, and the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein
(CRP). Twenty-one healthy sex- and age-matched subjects served as normal controls.
Results: The APST scored positive in 19 of 21 (90%) patients vs 0 controls. Mean
fragment Fl+2 plasma levels were significantly higher in patients with asthma
(267 + 243 pM) than in controls (150 + 51 pM; P = 0.0001). Similarly, plasma
levels of both D-dimer and VEGF were significantly higher in patients than in controls (D-dimer: 2364 + 1467 vs 1301 + 525 pM; P = 0.0001; VEGF: 1721 + 2566
vs 76 + 375 fM; P = 0.0001). A trend toward increased levels of Fl +2, D-dimer,
VEGF, and CRP was found in patients with a more severe disease according to
GINA classification.

Conclusion: Nonallergic asthma is characterized by autoreactivity as well as
increased coagulation and angiogenesis markers, which are known to enhance vascular permeability. The presence of circulating vasoactive factors may be relevant to
understand the disease pathophysiology and to detect novel therapeutic strategies in
nonallergic asthma.

It is generally agreed that a persistent airway inflammation,
characterized by the participation of both chemical mediators
and cells, plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of
asthma (1). Because atopy and allergen exposure account for
only a variable proportion of the asthmatic population as a
trigger for developing asthma, it is thought that other factors
play an essential role in the development of the disease (2, 3).
Inflammation of respiratory airways is present in both allergic and nonallergic asthmatics, and what differentiates the
two groups is the triggering event, which in the latter is often
undefined. Mastcells and eosinophils play a central patho

genic role in asthma. Mechanisms underlying recruitment and
activation of eosinophils appear to be similar in allergic and
nonallergic conditions (4), and increased inflammatory cells
populations, including eosinophils, are seen in the airways on
lavage and biopsy (5). Despite the absence of a detectable
specific IgE synthesis, in nonatopic asthma there is an
elevated expression of cytokines and chemokines (including
IL-13 and IL-5) that does not significantly differ from that
observed in atopic asthma (6). The involvement of autoimmune mechanisms has been hypothesized in patients with
nonatopic asthma following the detection of circulating

autoantibodies specific for a 55-kDa epithelial antigen (7, 8),
but those preliminary observations have not been further
substantiated.

Chronic urticaria (CU), a skin disorder characterized by
the recurrent eruption of transitory itchy wheals, sometimes
associated with angioedema, for more than 6 weeks is another
disorder whose pathogenesis has been considered obscure for
a long time. However, during the last decade it has become
clear that CU is frequently characterized by autoreactivity as
the intradermal injection of autologous serum causes a whealand-flare reaction in 30-60% of patients (9-12); moreover, a
proportion of autoreactive patients appear to have a real
autoimmune disorder, as serum IgG autoantibodies to IgE or
to the high affinity IgE receptor, FceRI, can be detected in
25-40% of patients (9-15). The autoreactive nature of CU has
been recently confirmed by the finding that the intradermal
injection of autologous plasma induces a wheal-and-flare reaction even more frequently than autologous serum in patients
with CU (16). Studies carried out by us have also shown that
CU is characterized by an activation of the coagulation cascade by the extrinsic pathway (17, 18) and by an increase in
plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (19). All
these mechanisms seem to parallel disease activity in patients
with urticaria (16-19). Experimental data indicate that thrombin induces edema through an increase in vascular permeability (20, 21), an effect that is much reduced by antihistamines
and abolished if mast cells granules are depleted (21); moreover, thrombin triggers mast cell degranulation (22) and may
activate protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) on mast cells
(23). In some mast cell populations, the response to thrombin
is equipotent with FceRI-mediated activation (24). Further,
recent studies demonstrated that eosinophils are an important
source of tissue factor (TF), the key initiator of the coagulation cascade (25). In keeping with this last observation, we
found that both the activation of the coagulation cascade and
VEGF hyper-expression are associated with eosinophils (26).

During the last years, several clinical and experimental
data providing a link between these two apparently distant
conditions, namely CU and nonallergic asthma, have
appeared in the medical literature. First, it was found that
patients with nonallergic asthma frequently score positive on
the autologous serum skin test (ASST), suggesting the presence of circulating histamine-releasing factors in this disease
(27), a finding that confirms pioneering observations by
a Swedish doctor who carried out experiments with the
so-called autoserum test as long as 50 years ago (28). This
observation was further analyzed by other researchers who
showed that in patients with asthma, a positive ASST is associated with an increase in bronchial hyper-responsiveness
(29). Moreover, bronchial hyper-responsiveness, which is a
hallmark of asthma, is a frequent finding in patients with CU
(30). Finally, recent reports suggest an activation of the
extrinsic coagulation pathway in acute asthma (31). In light
of these observations and of our recent findings in CU, we
looked for the presence of autoreactivity (by evaluation of
skin reactivity to autologous plasma), activation of the coagulation cascade (by measuring plasma levels of two markers
of coagulation activation, i.e., the prothrombin fragment

Patients and methods
Patients

This cross-sectional study was carried out on 21 adult

patients (M/F 1/20; mean age 40.6 years [SD 17.6 years],

range 16-70) with nonallergic asthma. Nonallergic asthma
was diagnosed if the following criteria were fulfilled:

© Clinical history of repeated asthma episodes responding
to short acting beta agonists.

e@ Negative skin-prick tests with a large series of commercial (Allergopharma, Reinbek, Germany) extracts of
both seasonal and perennial airborne allergens including
pollens (grass, mugwort, ragweed, pellitory, plantain,
birch, olive, and cypress), molds (Al/ternaria tenuis,
Aspergillus fumigatus, Cladosporium herbarum, Candida
albicans, Penicillium notatum, and Tricophyton mentagrophytes), house dust mites, and both cat and dog
dander.

e@ Bronchial hyper-responsiveness, as demonstrated by positive metacholine provocation.

Asthma severity was graded following the Global Initiative
for Asthma (GINA) guidelines.

The disease duration ranged between | and 25 years. Five
of the 21 (24%) patients had a history of aspirin-exacerbated

asthma. No patient had a present or past history of CU, and
no patient had a history of recent viral or bacterial respiratory infections.

Twenty-one healthy subjects (M/F 1/20; mean age
42.0 years, range 18-68) served as control group.

The study was approved by the local review board, and all
of the subjects gave their informed consent before participating in the study.

Autologous plasma skin test

All patients underwent the intradermal injection of 0.05 ml
of sterile, autologous plasma anticoagulated with Na citrate
(autologous plasma skin test, APST) that was carried out
and read as previously described (16). We performed the
APST rather than the ASST because in previous studies of
patients with urticaria we found that APST scores more
frequently positive, and this prompted us to start studying
the coagulation cascade in that skin disorder (16-18). No
patient was taking antihistamines when APST was performed, whereas they continued their usual anti-asthma medication. A skin-prick test with histamine 10 mg/ml and an
intradermal test with 0.05 ml of saline were used as positive
and negative controls, respectively. The APST was regarded
as positive if a clear-cut wheal-and-flare reaction was present
both at 15 and 30 min in the total absence of any reactivity
to saline.

Plasma measurements

Prothrombin fragment F1+2, a marker of thrombin generation, was measured in Na citrate-anticoagulated plasmas by
sandwich ELISA (Enzygnost Fl+2; Behring Diagnostics
GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany). Intra-assay and_ inter-assay
coefficients of variation were 5% and 8%, respectively.

D-dimer, a marker of fibrin generation and degradation, was
measured in Na citrate-anticoagulated plasmas by ELISA
(Zymutest D-dimer; Hyphen BioMed, Neuville sur Oise,
France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
intra- and inter-assay CVs were 10% and 15%, respectively.

Plasma VEGF concentration was measured by a sandwich
enzyme immunoassay (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis,
MN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 5%
and 7%, respectively.

C-reactive protein (CRP) plasma concentration was measured using a sandwich enzyme immunoassay (Zymutest
CRP, Hyphen BioMed, Neuville-sur-Oise, France). Intraand inter-assay variability was lower than 11%.

Statistics

Data were analyzed using the spss PC statistical package, version 17.00 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). As the plasma
measurements were positively skewed, they were log-transformed before analysis. The Fl+2, D-dimer, and VEGF
results are given as antilog values of mean values (geometric
mean) with standard deviation (SD). Student’s ¢-test for

unpaired data was used to assess the statistical significance of
the differences between the patients and normal controls.
Correlations were assessed by means of least-squares linear
regression. Proportions were compared with the chi-square
test with Yates’ correction. Probability (P) values <0.05 were
considered statistically significant.

Results

The autologous plasma skin test scored positive in 19/21
(90%) patients with nonallergic asthma (Table 1) and scored
negative in all control subjects (P = 0.0001). An example of
positive APST in patients with asthma is shown in Fig. 1.
Interestingly, the only two APST-negative patients with
asthma had a_ history of aspirin-exacerbated asthma,
although the association did not reach statistical significance.
In all patients and controls, the intradermal injection of
saline did not induce any skin reaction. Mean fragment
F1+2 plasma levels were significantly higher in patients with
asthma (267 + 243 pM) than in controls (150 + 51 pM;
P = 0.0001) (Fig. 2). Similarly, plasma levels of both
D-dimer and VEGF were significantly higher in patients than
in controls (D-dimer: 2364 + 1467 vs 1301 + 525 pM;
P = 0.0001; VEGF: 1721 + 2566 vs 76 + 375fM; and
P = 0.0001) (Figs 3 and 4). In patients with asthma, CRP
plasma levels (0.74 + 2.57 mg/ml) were slightly higher than
those of normal controls (0.45 + 0.47) without reaching
statistical significance.

A significant correlation was found between Fl+2 and
D-dimer plasma levels in patients with nonallergic asthma
(r = 0.427, P = 0.05). Fl+2 also correlated with CRP
(r = 0.572, P = 0.007), whereas no other correlation was
observed between coagulation markers and VEGF or CRP.
A trend toward increased levels of Fl +2, D-dimer, VEGF,
and CRP was found in patients with a more severe disease
according to the GINA classification: patients (n = 10) with

Discussion

Both allergic and nonallergic asthma are essentially inflammatory diseases. In this study, we were able to detect circulating vasoactive factors in most patients with nonallergic
asthma as shown by the wheal-and-flare reaction upon intradermal injection of autologous plasma. This finding confirms
and strengthens previous observations based on skin testing
using autologous serum instead of autologous plasma (27).
In light of our recent observations in CU, a disease that is
also characterized by autoreactivity (16), we studied both
coagulation markers and VEGF in patients with nonallergic
asthma (17-19). The findings in patients with asthma were
strikingly similar to those in patients with CU, with significant thrombin generation, activation of the coagulation cascade, and increase in plasma VEGF. So far, we did not
perform immunohistochemical studies on patients with
asthma yet; however, based on our previous observations in
patients with CU, eosinophils are a possible source of both
TF and VEGF (32). The activation of the coagulation has
been recently observed in both allergic and nonallergic
asthma (31, 33, 34). Interestingly, in animal experimental
models, coagulation factor VII deficiency is associated with a
reduced asthmatic response (35). Furthermore, ample evidence exists on the close link between inflammation and
coagulation (36, 37). Proinflammatory cytokines such as
interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a)
induce the expression of TF, the main initiator of blood
coagulation. Tissue factor activates the coagulation cascade
generating thrombin, which leads to the formation of fibrin
clot from fibrinogen. At the cellular level, the coagulant

Cugno et al.

mediators act on protease-activated receptors (PAR) inducing
the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (37, 38). In turn,
the two systems — coagulation and inflammation — activate
each other, thus amplifying the response. Because asthma is
regarded as a chronic inflammatory disorder, our data showing a correlation between the coagulation marker Fl +2 and
the inflammatory marker CRP is not surprising and is in
accordance with previous observations in other inflammatory
diseases (39).

In view of the present observations, nonallergic asthma
enters a (hitherto restricted) group of diseases characterized
by ‘autoreactivity’, including CU, the multiple drug allergy
syndrome, and multiple NSAID intolerance (40-43). It is
possible that in all these conditions the activation of the
coagulation cascade as well as VEGF play a pathogenic role,
maybe as amplification systems; in effect, there are indirect
data suggesting a relevant role for coagulation cascade in the

Autoreactivity, coagulation and angiogenesis in nonallergic asthma

clinical expression of asthma (34, 35). Although such diseases
appear to be distinct from an etiological and pathogenic
point of view, they are, nonetheless, all characterized by a
state of chronic reactivity of different organs that is triggered
both by exogenous and endogenous factors. Specifically, in
the case of asthma, the activation of the coagulation cascade
might be secondary to bronchial mucosa inflammation. In
conclusion, nonallergic asthma is characterized by autoreactivity as well as increased coagulation and angiogenesis markers, which are known to enhance vascular permeability. The
presence of circulating vasoactive factors may be relevant to
understand the disease pathophysiology and to detect novel
therapeutic strategies in nonallergic asthma.
