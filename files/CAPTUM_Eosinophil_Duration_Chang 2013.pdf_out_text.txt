KEYWORDS Background/ Purpose: Increased IgE and eosinophil levels are frequently observed in cutaneous
Acute; inflammation and are thought to provoke the occurrence of urticaria. However, the relationChronic urticaria; ship of these factors with the disease duration of urticaria remains unclear. The aim of this
Eosinophil study was to compare serum total IgE levels, specific IgE sensitization rates and eosinophil
percentage; percentages between acute and chronic urticaria in children.
Immunoglobulin E Methods: A total of 165 patients (104 with acute and 61 with chronic urticaria) from a tertiary
(IgE); referral hospital were enrolled in this study. Serum levels of total IgE, prevalence of sensitizaSpecific tion to food and aeroallergens and blood eosinophil percentages were compared by the disease

(IgE) Results: There were no statistical differences in total IgE production, positive sensitization to

specific allergens and eosinophil percentages between the patients with acute and chronic
urticaria. There is a higher prevalence of sensitization to aeroallergens than food allergens
in children with urticaria. In terms of gender, males had significantly higher serum IgE levels
than females.

Conclusion: Boys potentially have a higher serum IgE expression than girls children with urticaria. IgE levels and eosinophil percentages are not good indicators for a prolonged course

Introduction Methods

Urticaria is an allergic skin disease that affects 15% to 25%
of the population at some point in their life.'? It is characterized by the appearance of transient wheals, which
may be accompanied by angioedema. Wheals are edematous skin lesions of variable size with well-demarcated
surrounding reflex erythema. Individual rashes usually last
for minutes or a few hours and rarely persist for up to 24
hours. Itch is the dominant symptom. Angioedema appears
as pronounced swelling of subcutaneous tissue, with
a predilection for the periorbital and perioral areas and
may involve mucous membranes. Pain is sometimes complained of rather than itching, with a slower resolution time
of up to 72 hours compared to wheals.?

Urticaria can either occur acutely or evolve in a chronic
mode. Acute urticaria is defined as wheals presenting
for less than 6 weeks, whereas chronic urticaria means
a duration lasting beyond 6 weeks.° A variety of studies
have indicated that urticaria results from a complex physiopathology involving multiple inflammatory pathways,
which explains the wide heterogeneity of clinical symptoms
and the variable therapeutic responsiveness.” However,
the exact mechanisms contributing to the different clinical
manifestations remain obscure.

The natural history of acute and chronic urticaria is
particularly important because different treatment
modalities vary with the disease course. IgE-mediated mast
cell activation is regarded as the major immunologic
pathway in acute urticaria. In chronic urticaria, the autoimmune dimension became apparent when Greaves et al°
identified specific IgG antibodies for the «-chain of the
high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRla) in patients. This autoimmune origin represents at least 30% to 50% of patients
with chronic urticaria,°’’ suggesting that IgG autoantibodies rather than IgE contribute to the occurrence of
chronic forms. However, reports on the possible association
between the clinical course and IgE are very limited.

Eosinophils are also proposed to play a key role and
contribute to tissue damage in urticaria. The crucial
potential of eosinophils in the inflammatory process of
urticaria is supported by the association of urticarial skin
lesions in individuals with eosinophilic disorders, such as
hyper-eosinophilic syndrome. Although there is strong
evidence in the literature supporting the role of eosinophils
in urticaria, few reports exist concerning children, and
little is known about the influence on sustained disease
course. To investigate the relationship of IgE and eosinophils with the disease course of urticaria in children, we
carried out a comparison of these factors between children
with acute and chronic urticaria.

Patients and study design

Children who visited the pediatric allergy or dermatologic
clinic of National Taiwan University Hospital between May
2002 and August 2006 with a diagnosis of urticaria were
included in this study. Those with comorbidities of other
major systemic diseases were excluded. A total of 165
children were enrolled in this study, with a mean age of
7.61 + 4.64 years (range 1—17 years). The patients were
classified as either acute or chronic urticaria. Acute urticaria was defined by the recurrence of the lesions over
a time period of less than 6 weeks, while chronic urticaria
was defined as wheals that had been continuously or
intermittently occurring for at least 6 weeks.* Serum total
IgE levels, positive sensitization rates of specific IgE
antibodies, and eosinophil percentages were compared
between the two groups.

Total IgE and specific IgE antibodies

Venous blood samples were obtained from the study
patients on their clinic visit. Sera were separated by
centrifugation and analyzed for concentration of total IgE
or specific IgE antibodies. Thirty-nine types of specific IgE
antibodies, including 23 to inhalant and 16 to food allergens, were assayed. Serum levels of total IgE (kU/L) were
determined by the commercial ImmunoCAP250 system
(Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), while those of specific IgE
antibodies (kKU/L) by the ImmunoCAP250 system or MAST
Immunosystems (Hitachi, Kernersville, NC, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The sensitivity of the
assay for total IgE detection was between 2 kU/L and
5000 kU/L. Sensitization rates to specific allergens were
regarded as positive if at least one of the results of specific
IgE against the selected allergen was >2+, with values
>0.7 kU/L in the CAP test or >2.5 kU/L in the MAST test.

Statistical analysis

Total IgE levels were converted to log;9 and expressed as
geometric means for comparison by the Student’s t test
between different groups. IgE levels too small to be
detected (<2 kU/L) were ascribed a value of 1 kU/L for log
transformation; there was only one such instance in the
chronic group. The Chi-square test was used to analyze
differences of sensitization rates to specific allergens, and
proportions of elevated eosinophil percentages between
the acute and chronic groups. Statistical significance of
IgE and eosinophils in children with urticaria

55

 

eosinophil percentage between the two groups was
measured using the Mann-Whitney test. Results were
considered significant if the p value was <0.05. All of the
statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 13.0
for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Results

Among the 165 study patients, 104 had acute and 61 chronic
urticaria. The mean age at time of blood sampling was
6.39 + 4.04 years in the acute group and 9.70 + 4.88 years
in the chronic group. The age distribution in the two
groups is shown in Table 1. The enrolled children had an
approximately 1:1 female to male ratio, which continued
through the two groups (Table 1). The frequency of the
patients with a personal history of other allergic diseases
(allergic rhinitis, asthma, and atopic dermatitis) was similar
between the acute and chronic groups (Table 1), and the
most common disease was allergic rhinitis in both groups.
Total serum IgE levels of our samples ranged from
undetectable (read as <2 kU/L) to 2000 kU/L. Sixty-two
percent of the acute group and 41.67% of the chronic group
had levels of <150 kU/L, and 11.54% of the acute group and
21.3% of the chronic group had levels >500 kU/L. Less than
10% of the levels exceeded 1000 kU/L in either group. The
overall distribution of total IgE values in the acute and
chronic groups showed a marked skew to the right (Fig. 1).
Following logarithmic conversion the distribution of values
became Gaussian, with a significantly higher geometric
mean of 159.58 kU/L in the chronic group compared to
94.25 kU/L in the acute group (p < 0.05) (Table 2). The
patients were then classified into two distinct subgroups
according to whether there were other allergic diseases
exit, and a significantly higher IgE levels in the chronic
group than that in the acute group was found in the
subgroup of patients without other allergic diseases
(p < 0.05) (Table 2).

We further divided the patients into subgroups by age to
assess differences of total IgE levels between the acute and
chronic groups. As might be anticipated, total IgE levels had
a trend of increasing with age. This age-related rise was

steeper and reached higher levels in the chronic group
(Fig. 2). Although a higher mean IgE level in the chronic
group compared to the acute group was apparent in the 13
years to 18 years group, it did not show statistical significance (Table 2).

We also compared total IgE concentrations by gender,
and found that males had a greater geometric mean value
than females (164.24 kU/L, n = 82 in males vs. 78.82 kU/L,
n = 78 in females, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3).

Thirty-nine specific IgE antibodies to inhaled or food
allergens were documented by MAST or CAP test. The
MAST/CAP tests ratio was 20/79 (0.25) in the acute group
and 6/50 (0.12) in the chronic group. Fifty out of 99 (50.5%)
subjects in the acute group and 31 out of 56 (55.4%)
subjects in the chronic group had positive sensitization
rates. There were no significant differences between the
two groups (p = 0.561; Table 3). We further compared the
prevalence of sensitization to specific allergens between
the acute and chronic groups within the subgroups of
patients with and without other allergic diseases separately, and they were also not statistically different
(Table 3). With regards to the rates of positive sensitization
to inhaled and food allergens separately, there were no
statistical differences between the acute and chronic
groups (Table 3). The prevalence of sensitization to
aeroallergens was significantly higher than that of food
allergens in both the acute and chronic groups (p < 0.05)
(Table 3), with the highest prevalence and mean values of
specific IgE to mite allergens in both groups (sensitization to
Der p and Der f = 37.4% and 39.4%, respectively, in the
acute group, and 47.3% and 49.1%, respectively, in the
chronic group). Among the food allergens tested, milk was
the most common allergen in the acute group (9 patients).

To compare the significance of eosinophil percentage
between the acute and chronic groups, 84 and 54 patients
were included, respectively, and the results showed no
statistical difference (median of 2.1% in the acute group vs.
2.0% in the chronic group, p = 0.836; Fig. 4). The proportion of patients with elevated eosinophil percentages was
also analyzed and compared between the two groups. The
upper normal limit was set at 5%. A great majority of values
lay within the normal range, with only 12 (14.3%) subjects
in the acute group and 7 (13%) subjects in the chronic group
with values exceeding the reference range. There was no

Discussion

Urticaria occurred equally in both sexes in our study, which
is different from previous studies based on the general
population or adults, where urticaria occurred more
commonly in females than in males.®? It has been established that sex hormones can play a part in the pathogenesis of many diseases and account for differences in the
prevalence of diseases between genders. A lack of sex
hormone stimulation before puberty may provide a partial
explanation for the discordant results in our study. More
patients and a younger mean age in the acute urticaria
group correspond to previous studies, where acute urticaria
was found to be a more frequent type than chronic urticaria
in childhood.'°" Because our hospital is a tertiary referral
center, more patients with severe and prolonged skin
lesions may have come to our clinic. We postulate that the
frequency of chronic urticaria is higher in our study and it
does not reflect the prevalence in the general population.

Our estimates of serum total IgE levels demonstrated
a wide distribution, with higher geometric mean levels than
those previously reported based on nonallergic children.'2~'4 This implies a pathogenic role of IgE in urticaria.
The results also showed significantly higher IgE mean levels

continued through the subgroup of patients without other
allergic diseases. Although chronic urticaria is usually
regarded as non-IlgE mediated, previous studies reported
that total IgE was elevated among chronic urticaria patients
compared to normal controls.'>''® Kessel et al'® also found
that total IgE was associated with disease severity and
duration, and suggested that IgE should be considered as
a marker to evaluate chronic urticaria patients. Additional
studies should be conducted to clarify the pathogenic role
of IgE in chronic urticaria and thus provide a basis for
directing therapeutic strategies.

The mean levels of total IgE in patients with acute
urticaria in our study are similar to a previous report based
on general population samples where values rose steadily
from birth to age approximately 10 years.'” A steeper rise
of IgE levels after puberty was noted in our chronic group.
An older mean age in the chronic group may have contributed to the higher IgE expression compared the acute
group, while there were no significant differences in IgE
levels in the age subgroups between the two groups.

Our finding of a significant tendency for total IgE levels
to be higher in males than in females was in keeping with
other reports.'*'® 72 Because females predominate in
autoimmune diseases,”> a greater pathogenic role of the
autoimmune component rather than IgE in the disease
process for females may explain this sex difference. The

genders also reflects a complex and diverse pathogenic role
of IgE expression.

Few data are available concerning the relationship of
sensitization prevalence to common allergens with the
disease duration of urticaria. We tried to identify their
association but failed to detect significant differences
between the two groups. There were also no differences
with regards to the proportion of sensitization to inhale and
food allergens between the acute and chronic groups,
which reflects the lack of tendency of sensitization to
ingested or aeroallergens in both groups. Although several
studies have obtained significant correlations between the
results of the MAST and CAP systems, the CAP test tended
to have better sensitivity.2* 7° The lower ratio of the CAP/
MAST tests in the chronic group than that of the acute group
may result in underestimation of the sensitization rates of
the chronic group.

Urticaria is regarded to be induced by ingested allergens
much more frequently than inhalants, and IgE-mediated
allergies to food are the most common cause of the acute
form. This study showed discordant results in that there

was a significantly higher prevalence of sensitization to
aeroallergens than food allergens both in the acute and
chronic group. Previous studies have shown that various
infections, especially viruses or mycoplasma related respiratory infections, were most the frequently documented
etiologies of acute urticaria in children,'®?”?® and suggested to perform a detailed survey for infectious agents in
urticaria patients with febrile episodes, respiratory tract
symptoms or poor responses to antihistamine treatment.
Numerous studies also reported that several viral and
mycoplasma infections may promote allergic respiratory
inflammation in children.??°° Therefore, we can suppose
that the results of a significantly higher sensitization rate to
aeroallergens than food allergens in both the acute and
chronic groups could be the outcome of airway allergic
sensitization evoked by those respiratory infections, which
also trigger urticaria occurrence. It further implies that
routine laboratory screening for common allergens to
discover the cause leading to urticaria is not appropriate. It
might be more feasible to consider the test results as an
index of atopy when respiratory infections are associated
with urticaria occurrence.

Eosinophils have been suggested to be implicated in
urticaria,*" °° and a definite rise in eosinophil counts during
the acute stage of urticaria has been illustrated.*
However, a lack of peripheral blood eosinophilia and
a total absence of eosinophils in patients with chronic
urticaria have also been reported.*” >? These conflicting
results demonstrate the complex role of eosinophils in
urticaria. We did not find a statistical difference in eosinophil percentage between the acute and chronic groups,
and the proportion of patients with an elevated eosinophil
percentage also did not differ significantly between the two
groups. Our results are different from a previous study in
which the percentage of cytoplasmic vacuolation of circulating eosinophils was significantly increased in the longduration group compared with the short-duration group in
urticaria.*° Another study also revealed that up-regulation
of chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecules (CRTH2)
on eosinophils was observed in chronic but not acute
urticaria patients.’ Leiferman et al? reported that the
deposition of localized eosinophil granule proteins is
greatly out of proportion to the number of identifiable cells
in dermatologic diseases, and suggested that eosinophil
involvement in cutaneous diseases can not be judged by the
number of intact eosinophils in the tissue. They further
suggested that exploring the granule constituents liberated
from infiltrating eosinophils or surface molecules expressed
as an indicator of eosinophil activation might be a better
marker of eosinophil involvement.

In conclusion, boys potentially have a higher serum IgE
expression than girls with urticaria. IgE levels and eosinophil percentages are not good indicators for a prolonged
course of urticaria. A higher prevalence of sensitization to
aeroallergens than food allergens was found in children
with urticaria. The prevalence of sensitization to aeroallergens was significantly higher than that of food allergens in children with urticaria. Routine laboratory analysis
for common allergens is not appropriate, and it could be
a feasible approach to detect a predilection for atopy when
respiratory infections are the causative factors of urticaria
occurrence.
