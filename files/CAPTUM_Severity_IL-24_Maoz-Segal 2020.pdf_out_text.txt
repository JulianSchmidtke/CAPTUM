ABSTRACT

Background: Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU) is a relatively common immune mediated
disease that can be effectively treated nowadays. Nevertheless, for some patients remission
cannot be achieved following current treatment recommendations, defined as resistant CSU (rCSU). Treating r-CSU is challenging, and, currently, there are no recommended interventions. In
this real-life study we describe successful therapy of 18 r-CSU patients using an "intensified protocol" of anti-lgE-antibody (omalizumab) concomitantly with an immunosuppressant. We defined
the r-CSU phenotype and compared it to omalizumab-responsive CSU (Or-CSU) phenotype.

Methods: Clinical and serological data of 72 CSU patients (ie, 18 r-CSU and 54 age and sex
matched Or-CSU) were retrospectively collected and analyzed. All patients were diagnosed with
CSU for >6 months and treated at the Sheba Medical Center during 2013-2018.

Results: Of 289 CSU patients, 18 (6%) were diagnosed with r-CSU and treated with the "intensified protocol" including omalizumab and cyclosporine-A (16p), methotrexate (1p), and azathioprine (1p). Of which, 14/18 (78%) achieved complete remission, 2/18 (11%) partial remission,
and 2/18 (11%) no remission. During follow-up no serious adverse events were documented. rCSU patients received higher doses of antihistamine (p < 0.0001) and omalizumab (425 + 58 mg/
month vs. 283 + 86 mg/month; p < 0.0001) compared to Or-CSU. The r-CSU phenotype was
linked with concomitant autoimmunity (p = 0.0005) and a lower level of IgE prior to initiation of
therapy (p = 0.027).

 

 

Conclusion: r-CSU may be a distinct CSU phenotype characterized by severe disease, concomitant autoimmunity, and lower baseline-IgE levels (low "autoallergy"). An "intensified protocol"

INTRODUCTION

Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU) is an immune mediated disorder that affects up to 1% of
the general population, and it is characterized by
hives, pruritus, and frequent angioedema.’ This
chronic condition is associated with various comorbidities, decreased quality of life, and
reduced ability to maintain normal activities.2~4
Two immune mechanisms were linked with CSU
pathogenesis. “Type |” response that is mediated
by IgE antibodies, but unlike classic allergy, these
IgE antibodies are directed at auto-antigens (e.g.
IL-24).5 This mechanism was recently termed
“Auto-allergy". “Type Il” immune responses are
autoimmune in nature and are mediated by IgG
autoantibodies directed against the high-affinity
receptor for IgE (FceR1) or membrane-bound
IgE.°7

Regardless of the dominant immunemechanisms, a strong link was observed between
CSU and concomitant autoimmunity, namely, systemic or organ specific autoimmune diseases and/
or autoantibodies. A myriad of autoimmune diseases such as pernicious anemia, psoriasis, vitiligo,
type I-diabetes mellitus, Celiac disease, Graves'
disease, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, are more
prevalent among CSU patients.*? Equally,
systemic autoantibodies such as__ antiThyroperoxidase (Anti-TPO) and anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) were documented to be more
common in CSU. Like other autoimmune diseases,
CSU was linked with female gender and family
history of autoimmunity.?""*

 

Treatment guidelines for CSU were published
by the EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF/WAO and revised in
2018.7'13 Similar guidelines were published in
2014 by the American group representing the
Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters
(JTFPP),'* the Israeli Association for Allergy and
Clinical Immunology (IAACI), and — other

 

groups.’*'"® In all algorithms for CSU treatment,
a stepwise approach is recommended. The first
step includes regular doses of second generation
antihistamines followed by up to four-fold incremental increase in antihistamine dose. Leukotriene
antagonists were included in former guidelines (ie,
2013) as part of the third line of therapy for CSU.
However, in 2018 these drugs were no-longer
advised as there is scarce evidence for their efficacy. Thus, currently only omalizumab and cyclosporine are included as third and fourth line of
therapy, respectively. Of note, in Israel the Ministry
of Health instructions, issued in 2015, require
leukotriene antagonist therapy prior to omalizumab. This algorithm revolutionized CSU management in the last decade and set the goal of
achieving complete remission of symptoms in all
patients. However, presently in up to 15% of patients disease remission can not be achieved. This
non-responding variant of disease is defined
resistant CSU (r-CSU).1”

Treatment of r-CSU in a clinical setting continues
to be a challenge. Development of new potent
drugs is 1 way to overcome r-CSU, whereas combination of available modalities may be another
path to achieve disease remission. In the current
study we describe 18 r-CSU patients that were
successfully treated with a combination of omalizumab and an immunosuppressive medication (ie,
intensified protocol). Additionally, we compared rCSU patients with CSU patients that responded
favorably to omalizumab (Or-CSU) in order to
define the r-CSU phenotype. We believe the
knowledge obtained from this real-life experience
of treating r-CSU may help physicians worldwide.

METHODS

In this single center observational study, we
retrospectively evaluated 72 Israeli CSU patients
treated during January 2013 to December 2018. In
this period 289 CSU patients were treated in the
Volume 13, No. 8, Month 2020

Clinical Immunology and Allergy Department, at
Sheba Medical Center, Israel. Eighteen’® of these
patients were diagnosed with r-CSU, and 54
consecutive age and gender matched CSU
patients that were omalizumab responsive (OrCSU) served as a control group. r-CSU was defined
following failure to achieve disease remission
utilizing all steps of the recommended protocols
(ie, high dose second generation antihistamines,
Omalizumab, immunosuppressant). Notably,
although Urticaria Activity Score (UAS) was not
performed regularly in this study, very low disease
activity (eg, few lesions a week and mild
intermittent itch, which may be comparable to a
low UAS score of <6), was regarded as remission.
Demographic disease features (eg, disease
duration, co-presence of inducible urticaria,
angioedema, etc) comorbidities, laboratory parameters (as CRP and ESR; autoantibodies, baseline-IgE
levels etc), as well as treatment doses and outcomes
were collected and analyzed. Patients were followed
every 4 weeks. Blood analysis was preformed prior
to initiation of omalizumab and/or immunosuppressive therapy and thereafter, periodically, as
commonly practiced (ie, complete blood count,
transaminase levels, creatinine level, and cyclosporine levels, if relevant). This study received
approval by the institutional ethics committee and
fulfilled the ethical guidelines of the declaration of
Helsinki (Edinburgh 2000).

 

In the study most patients received omalizumab
300 mg/month (the recommended dose by the
Israeli Ministry of Health) and fewer 150 mg/
month, if was sufficient for complete response.
When a partial response to omalizumab was
observed, dose escalation was attempted (eg,
450 mg/month) if approved by the patient's health
maintenance organization (HMO). Notably, all patients received at least 2 courses of oral glucocorticoids and >8 weeks of montelukast within the
12 months prior to initiation of omalizumab (as
required by the Israeli regulation). Immunosuppressive drugs were given at the following doses:
Cyclosporine 1-3 mg/kg/day, azathioprine 12.5 mg/kg/day, and methotrexate up to 20 mg/
week. Doses were tailored individually and were
raised gradually according to disease severity and
drug tolerability. Response to therapy was determined after 3-6 months of initiation of immunosuppressant or  omalizumab respectively.

 

 

 

Treatment outcomes were defined as complete
remission if full withdrawal of glucocorticoids
therapy was achieved and disease activity was
improved by > 80% (eg, .hives, rash, angioedema)
compared to baseline, in other words if disease
activity was very low and/or non-active. Partial
response was withdrawal of glucocorticoids therapy and decrease of symptoms by 50-80% and
lack of response was if improvement criteria were
not met (eg, less than 50%), as reported by the
patient and physician. Serious adverse events were
determined as those that required hospitalization
or stopping of an immunosuppressive drug. CSU
was considered to be “associated with autoimmunity” if concomitant overt autoimmune disease
and/or high titers of autoantibodies were present.

Statistics

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS
24.0. For all tests p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Continuous variables were
described as mean + SD, and categorical variables
as percentages. Comparisons between cases (rCSU group) and controls (Or-CSU group) were
analyzed by Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test as
appropriate for categorical variables, and by Student's T-test or Mann-Whitney for continuous
variables.

 

RESULTS

In our cohort of 289 CSU patients, 161 (56%)
achieved remission while treated with regular or
high dose antihistamines, and 128 (44%) required
third/fourth lines of treatment. Of these patients,
92/128 (72%) were initially treated with omalizumab, and 36/128 (28%) initially treated with
immunosuppressive drug. If a response was not
achieved patients were diagnosed with r-CSU, as
both drugs (either omalizumab or cyclosporine)
did not induce remission (Fig. 1). Subsequently, rCSU patients were treated with the “intensified

 

protocol” that includes omalizumab at the
highest dose (300 mg/month [3p] and 450 mg/
month [15p]) in conjunction with an

immunosuppressive drug (Cyclosporine [16p],
Methotrexate [1p] or Azathioprine [1p]). In the
current study the mean duration of treatment
with the “intensified protocol” was 14 + 8 months
(range 9-40 months), whereas the whole follow

“intensified protocol” were complete remission in
14/18 (78%; of which 1 was treated with methotrexate), partial response in 2/18 (11%; of which 1

2/18 (11%) of patients. Noteworthy, during followup, 6/14 (43%) patients that achieved complete
remission could decrease therapy: 4/6 (67%)
reduced 1 of the drugs, and 2/6 (33%) patients
discontinued both drugs with no relapse. No
serious adverse events were documented during
follow up. Dose modifications of cyclosporine
were required in 2 patients due to high blood
pressure and mild elevation of creatinine level
(1.5 mg/dl) for another; both normalized
thereafter.

r-CSU compared to omalizumab responsive
disease (Or-CSU)

Our 18 r-CSU patients were age and gender
matched with 54 consecutive CSU patients that
achieved complete remission with omalizumab
(Or-CSU). As can be expected r-CSU patients
received higher doses of antihistamines, omalizumab and montelukast compared to Or-CSU group
(Table 1). Associated autoimmunity was more
common among r-CSU group vs Or-CSU (55% vs
20%, p = 0.0005). In contrast, higher levels of IgE
prior to initiation of omalizumab therapy were less
prevalent among r-CSU patients compared to OrCSU (18% vs 41%, respectively; p = 0.027)
although baseline IgE levels were available only for
11/18 r-CSU and 29/54 Or-CSU patients
compared.

DISCUSSION

CSU therapy changed dramatically in the last
decade and complete remission of symptoms was
set as an achievable goal. Nevertheless, a sizable
proportion of patients suffer from resistant disease
(r-CSU), despite improvements in therapy, for
which recommended interventions are lacking.
Multiple new medications are being investigated
for this resistant phenotype of CSU: 2 novel antiIgE antibodies (ligelizumab and UB-221), the anticytokine monoclonal antibodies (dupilumab,
reslizumab, mepolizumab, and benralizumab), a
CRTh2 antagonist, a monoclonal antibody to
Siglec-8 (AK002), Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors (fenebrutinib and Lou064), and a Syk inhibitor, as recently reviewed by Maurer et al.7®
These are intriguing therapeutic modalities that
are still in different stages of research, and migh
be found efficacious for r-CSU, but are expected
to be of high cost. This leaves many patients
worldwide without adequate treatment. In this
real-life clinical study we report for the first time,
to the best of our knowledge, results o
combining 2 modalities that are currently
available and reimbursed in most countries for
the treatment of r-CSU, namely the approved
anti-lgE monoclonal antibody, omalizumab,'?
with an  immunosuppressant agent. This
“intensified protocol” was efficacious in 16/18 of
r-CSU patients, of which 6 patients were able to
withdrawal 1 or both drugs and maintain
remission during follow up.

 

In the present study, in the context of real-life
clinical practice, r-CSU was diagnosed in 6% of
our entire CSU cohort, and in 14% of those that
required the third-fourth lines of therapy. This is
similar to previous reports. For instance, in a
former study r-CSU was reported in 7% of the
general CSU population,?° and lack of response to
omalizumab in 14-33% of treated patients. In a
multicenter retrospective analysis from Israel,
CSU remission was achieved in 86% of patients
treated with omalizumab. In other studies from
Latin America and Australia, 80% and 67% of
CSU patients, respectively, responded favorably
to this intervention.172°5 In contrast, a lower
success rate of omalizumab was_ recently
documented in a worldwide multicenter real-life
study, the AWARE study. The relatively lower

 

success of omalizumab was attributed to lack of
adherence to the recommended guidelines.?°?7
Furthermore, recent publications report that
urticaria-guideline recommendations, which
contribute to a higher quality of patient care, are
not followed precisely by 20% of physicians.?® An
additional explanation for this relatively high nonresponse rate may be the lack of up-dosing omalizumab that was utilized in our study.

 

The most commonly used immunosuppressant
in our “intensified protocol” was cyclosporine. The
use of cyclosporine is supported by data from
several clinical studies*? and most guidelines.
Admittedly, its safety profile is lower compared
to omalizumab with potential side effects such as
elevated creatinine, hypertension, _ fatigue,
gastrointestinal problems, gingivitis, | and
headaches.*° Yet, up to 2015 cyclosporine was
used prior to omalizumab in many countries, as
well as in Israel. In 2018 guidelines it is
recommended to use cyclosporine as a
alternative treatment option for omalizumab nonresponders.*" In a recently published small metaanalysis of cyclosporine efficacy and safety in
CSU, the results support its effectiveness, and it is
suggested that its safety is dose dependent.>?
Following these recommendations, the
“intensified protocol” includes low doses of
cyclosporine (1-2 mg/kg) concomitantly with
regular or high doses of omalizumab. No
significant adverse events were observed,
although close monitoring and dose adjusment
of cyclosporine was required for some patients.
Our results support the recently published
recommendations to consider adding low dose
cyclosporine to omalizumab in r-CSU patients.**
Data regarding methotrexate and azathioprine
for CSU is scarce.31345 Although both are used
as “steroid sparing” drugs for many autoimmune
conditions, they are seldom recommended for
CSU. In the current study, as described, only 2
patients that could not receive cyclosporine
received these drugs.

We compared the 2 phenotypes of CSU in our
cohort, namely r-CSU vs. Or-CSU, trying to find
biomarkers or other clinical parameters defining
each group. Indeed, recent reports characterized 2
possible endotypes according to the type of mast
cell degranulation signals: type | autoimmune CSU
mediated with IgE autoantibodies to auto
6 Maoz-Segal et al. World Allergy Organization Journal (2020) 13:100448

http://doi.org/10.1016/j.waojou.2020.100448

allergens (or autoallergy), and type Ilb autoimmune CSU mediated with autoantibodies that
target activating mast cells receptors. These 2
endotypes of autoimmune hypersensitivity have
been postulated as being etiologic in most CSU
patients. There is a need for development of
diagnostic tests to differentiate these 2 endotypes
of CSU in order to tailor the appropriate treatment
and help each patient achieve remission.2®
Intriguingly, we found 2 major differences
between r-CSU and Or-CSU in our study: High
total IgE levels (associated with type | autoimmunity) were related to Or-CSU phenotype (18% vs
41%, respectively) while concomitant autoimmunity (which may support type II autoimmunity) was
related to r-CSU phenotype (55% vs. 20%,
respectively).

 

The predictive role of specific and total IgE level
in CSU was evaluated in recent studies, and a
particular link with response to omalizumab has
been suggested.'7°°37 Additionally, more than
200 IgE autoantigens were detected in CSU
patients, but not in healthy subjects. Some of
these autoantibodies, such as IgE anti-IL-24 antibodies, are possible biomarkers, and their levels
correlate with disease severity.’*®° On the other
hand, low total IgE level prior to initiation of
therapy was associated with a slower response to
omalizumab, reduced efficacy of this drug and a
shorter time to disease relapse after omalizumab
discontinuation.*1~44 Similarly, we have found in
our cohort, that lower baseline IgE correlated
with r-CSU, further supporting baseline IgE levels
as a marker of response to anti-IgE therapy. Our
results are compatible with those demonstrated in
he PURIST study which demonstrated more severe disease and markedly lower IgE levels among
patients diagnosed with autoimmune CSU
compare to non-autoimmune CSU _patients.**
otably, better understanding of CSU endotypes
is needed, not only for choosing the better
reatment for each patient, but also, with no less
importance, for evaluation of treatment duration
following remission. For example, in a recent
study accepted for publication, it was confirmed
hat it is possible to half omalizumab dose and
maintain efficacy in a large subgroup of CSU
patients, which had an excellent response to full
dose omalizumab. Unfortunately, none of the

 

currently available biomarkers of efficacy or
severity of disease, including IgE level, were able
to predict which patients will relapse following
omalizumab dose reduction.*® Our results stand
in agreement with findings from former studies in
which associated autoimmunity was linked with
difficult to treat CSU. A higher rate of r-CSU was
documented among anti-nuclear antibodies
(ANA) positive patients, compared to those with
undetectable ANA.'° Moreover, in several studies
the autologous serum skin test, which supports
the presence of IgG autoantibodies directed
against FceRI IgE,*°*? was associated with a
slower response to therapy particularly to
omalizumab.*® Thus, it seems that the prevalence
of autoantibodies and/or autoimmune
comorbidities, as suggested by the results from
our study, may be considered a marker of
resistant/severe CSU.

Our study has several limitations derived from
its retrospective, observational nature. Nonetheess, these real-life data presented from our tertiary
center stand in agreement with data from another
arge Israeli multicenter study, as well as from
studies from other countries. All these studies
highlight the unmet need in treating r-CSU, as well
as the need for an individual tailored approach to
reating these patients according to disease
endotypes. Additionally, we did not measure
routinely UAS, nor IgG-anti-lgE receptor antibodies which are of great importance in the
pathogenesis of CSU.*? These parameters are not
used in common practice in Israel and these
specific antibodies are usually measured in
research laboratories and cannot be measured in
our country. Further prospective studies of r-CSU,
which will examine more specific markers, are
required.

 

 

CONCLUSIONS

In this clinical observational retrospective study,
an “intensified protocol" using omalizumab and an
immunosuppressant concomitantly was found to
be efficacious and safe for treating r-CSU patients,
and thus may be an alternative solution for this
difficult condition. In addition, r-CSU patients were
found to have more concomitant autoimmunity
and lower baseline-IgE levels and, as such, may be

regarded as a distinct phenotype of CSU, characterized by severe disease. Further prospective
controlled larger studies are required to verify this
approach.
