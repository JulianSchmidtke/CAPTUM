Background: Beside autoimmunity, coagulation pathway is also involved in the pathogenesis of chronic urticaria (CU). Previous
studies showed that plasma D-dimer levels paralleled the severity of the disease. To date, there are no data concerning D-dimer level
in Thai patients with CU.

Objective: This study aimed to find the relationship between plasma D-dimer levels and the disease severity of Thai CU patients. The
secondary objective is to analyze plasma D-dimer level in each group of patients who performed autologous plasma skin testing (APST)
and autologous serum skin testing (ASST).

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed case record forms of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) patients aged at least 18 years in Skin
Allergy Clinic, Siriraj Hospital Mahidol University, Bangkok, during June 2008 to June 2011.

Results: Of 120 patients, plasma D-dimer level was abnormal in 58 patients (48.3%). The study showed statistically significant positive
correlation between disease severity and plasma D-dimer level (p < 0.05, r = 0.537). There was no statistically significant difference
in plasma D-dimer level between APST positive and negative groups, and also between ASST positive and negative groups. In APST
negative group, plasma D-dimer level was elevated in 29 patients (47.5%) and correlated with disease severity.

Conclusion: This study showed elevated plasma D-dimer levels in nearly half of Thai patients with CIU. There was a positive correlation
between plasma D-dimer levels and the severity of disease activity. Investigation for plasma D-dimer level may be an alternative way
to evaluate disease severity in patients with CIU.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic urticaria (CU) is characterized by recurrent eruption
of itchy short-lived wheals and flares for longer than six weeks

duration [1]. Without identifiable causes after full investigation,
these patients are classified as chronic idiopathic urticaria
(CIU) [2]. One fourth to half of CIU patients, autoimmunity was
involved in the pathogenesis as proven by the detection of

autoantibodies (IgG) to IgE or to high affinity IgE receptors (FceRI)
on mast cell surfaces [3-8].

Besides autoimmunity, some parts of the pathogenesis of
CIU remain unclear. Fagiolo et al. [9] showed that IgG depleted
serums from CIU patients retain ability to induce a wheal-andflare reaction upon intradermal injection. These observations
suggest that there are some other mechanisms involving in the
pathogenesis of CIU. Another indirect evidence showed that the
percentage of positive autologus plasma skin testing (APST) is
higher than that of positive autologus serum skin testing (ASST)
(80% vs. 50%). This difference suggested that coagulation cascade
is possibly involved in the pathogenesis of CIU [10].

Asero et al. [10] showed significant elevated plasma levels of
prothrombin fragment (F1+2) in the circulation in CIU patients and
the level correlated with the severity of the disease [11]. Normally,
thrombin is involved in hemostasis including vessel wound healing
12]. For the pathophysiology of urticaria, thrombin increases
vascular permeability [13], stimulates mast cell degranulation [14]
and may activate protease activated receptor (PAR1) on mast cells
15]. Subsequent study reveals that activated Factor Vil, D-dimer
evel and F1+2 are elevated in CU patient but Factor XII level is
normal, leading to the conclusion of activated extrinsic pathway
involvement in CIU [11]. Recently, Takeda et al. [16] demonstrated
hypercoagulable pattern in activated partial thromboplastin time
(APTT) clot waveform analysis in patients with CIU, suggesting
a high potential involvement of intrinsic pathway in the
pathogenesis. It is probable that pathogenesis of CIU involves both
intrinsic and extrinsic pathway.
To date, there is no data concerning D-dimer level in Thai
patients with CIU. We aim to study the correlation between
D-dimer level and the severity of disease activity of Thai patients
with CIU.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This study was approved by Siriraj Institutional Review Board.
CIU was diagnosed on basis of recurrent eruption of wheals and
flare with or without angioedema for at least 6 weeks without
specific causes after appropriate evaluation [2].

We retrospectively reviewed case record forms of CIU patients
aged at least 18 years who attended Skin Allergy Clinic, Siriraj
Hospital Mahidol University, Bangkok, during June 2008 to June
2011. Inclusion criteria was CIU patients who had performed

apallergy.org

http://dx.doi.org/10.5415/apallergy.2013.3.2.100

plasma D-dimer level testing. Exclusion criterias were CIU patients
wi

th underlying diseases or taking any medicine which would
affect D-dimer level and patients with other causes of urticaria
(such as physical induced urticaria, drug-induced urticaria and
etc).
The demographic data, personal history, family history of
atopy and underlying disease of patients were recorded. Other
available data from patients’ records such as ASST, APST and
other laboratory investigations (complete blood count [CBC],
erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], anti-HBsAg, anti-HCV, antinuclear antibodies [ANA], anti-thyroglobulin and anti-microsomal
antibodies) were also reviewed.

 

Assessment of disease activity of CU

At the time of blood sampling, APST, ASST and disease activity
assessment, all patients discontinued short acting antihistamines
for at least three days, long acting antihistamines and systemic
corticosteroids for at least seven days. Disease activity was
assessed by EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF activity score [17] which is
composed of wheals score; none = 0, mild (< 20 lesions in 24
hours) = 1, moderate (20-50 lesions in 24 hours) = 2, intense (> 50
lesions in 24 hours) = 3 and the pruritus score for which none = 0,
mild (presence but not annoying or troublesome) = 1, moderate
(troublesome but does not interfere with normal activity or
sleeping) = 2, and intense (severe pruritus, which is sufficiently
troublesome to interfere with normal daily activity or sleep) = 3.
The disease activity is scored 0 to 6. We graded activity of disease
as follows; patients with 0 score considered as none, score 1-2
as mild, score 3-4 as moderate and score 5-6 as severe disease
activity.

D-dimer measurement

Measurement of plasma D-dimer level was done at the same
time as ASST, APST and clinical assessment. D-dimer plasma level
was measured by enzyme-linked fluorescence assay (ELFA) kits
(VIDAS® D-Dimer Exclusion Il) from bioMérieux, France. The cut-off
level is 500 ng/mL.

Autologous serum skin test and autologous plasma
skin test technique

Five mL of venous blood was placed in sterile plastic tubes
containing a buffered sodium citrate 3.2% (0.109 mol/L),
centrifuged at 500xg for 15 minutes and kept in aliquots for use in
APST. Another 5 mL of venous blood was allowed to clot at room

101
NSE Atala

temperature for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 500xg for 15
minutes and kept in aliquots for use in ASST. Sterile serum, plasma
and 0.9% normal saline (negative control), 0.05 mL each were
injected intradermally into patient's volar side of forearm with 27
Gneedles at least 3 cm apart by the same well-trained doctor. The
result was observed in 30 minutes. Wheal and flare at the site of
injection with the serum and/or plasma that was 3 mm larger than
saline control was interpreted as a positive result. Skin prick testing
with histamine (10 ~g/uL) was used as a positive control and was
interpreted at 15 minutes.

Statistical methods

Descriptive statistics, e.g. mean, median, maximum, minimum
and percentages were used to describe demographic data, plasma
D-dimer level and positivity of ASST and APST. The prevalence
of positive ASST and ASPT results was recorded as a number
and percentage. Correlation between D-dimer level and disease
severity score (0-6) was calculated by Spearmen’s rank correlation.
Difference in proportion of abnormal D-dimer level among the
disease severity was tested using Pearson's chi-square test; MannWhitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test were employed to test
the difference in D-dimer level between two groups (e.g., APST
positive vs. negative) and three groups (i.e., disease severity)

 

respectively. All statistical data analyses were performed using
SPSS for Windows version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

RESULTS

One hundred and twenty patients, 30 male (25%) and 90 female
(75%); with a mean age of 38.8 years (range 16-73 years) were
enrolled in the study. Of 120 patients, at the time of D-dimer level

tested, 63 (52.5%), 37 (30.8%) and 20 (16.7%) were categorized in
the mild, moderate and severe disease activity group, respectively.
Median duration of the disease was 12 months (min,max; 2,360
months). Six patients (5%) also had angioedema. Thirty-six
patients (30%) had personal history of atopy (allergic rhinitis: 24;
20%, asthma: 8; 6.7%, allergic conjunctivitis: 4; 3.3%). Twentyfive patients (20.8%) had family history of atopy (allergic rhinitis:
18; 15%, asthma: 6; 5%, atopic dermatitis: 1; 0.8%). There were no
associations between demographic data and plasma D-dimer
level or disease severity.

There was a statistically significant difference in D-dimer levels
among the three groups with different disease activities (p value <
0.05; Fig. 1 and Table 1). The study showed statistically significant

positive correlation between disease severity and plasma D-dimer
evel (p < 0.05, r = 0.537). D-dimer levels were abnormal (> 500
ng/mL) in 58 patients (48.3%). The proportion of abnormal plasma
D-dimer level was higher in the more severe disease activity group
(Table 1).

ASST and APST were both performed in 96 patients. ASST was
positive in 33 out of 96 patients (34.4%). APST was positive in 35
out of 96 patients (36.5%). Plasma D-dimer level was also elevated
in APST negative group (Table 2). There was no statistically
significant difference in plasma D-dimer level between APST
positive and negative groups, nor between ASST positive and
negative groups.

Three patients in our study had repeated plasma D-dimer
testing during the follow up period. All had decreased plasma
D-dimer levels together with decrease of the disease severity
scores, and their diseases became easily controlled by using

 

ower amounts of oral antihistamines, without using systemic
corticosteroids, or receiving anticoagulant treatment.

Thyroid autoantibodies were positive in 11 of 70 patients (15.7%).
Anti-nuclear antibodies were positive in 14 of 78 patients (17.9%).
Complete blood counts were normal in all patients (n = 104). ESR
levels were elevated in 19 of 56 patients (33.9%).

DISCUSSION

Apart from the autoimmunity that explains pathogenesis of
CIU, coagulation cascade was also involved in the disease from
the many evidences proposed [18]. Previous data showed increase
D-dimer level in 2 of 21 patients (10%) [11], 14 of 68 patients (20%)
[10] and 27 of 82 patients (35%) [19]. In our study, the plasma
D-dimer levels were elevated in 58 out of 120 patients (48.3%), a

apallergy.org

http://dx.doi.org/10.5415/apallergy.2013.3.2.100

percentage which was higher than previous reports [10, 11, 19].
The percentage difference is due perhaps to the differences of the
disease severity in each study. Our study also showed the positive
correlation between plasma D-dimer level and disease severity,
which is similar to previous studies performed in Europe [10, 11,
20]. Previous studies showed plasma D-dimer and F142 levels
were normal after disease remission or during treatment [10, 16,
20]. Our three patients who had repeated D-dimer levels also had
decreased plasma D-dimer levels with decreased disease severity
scores.

Asero et al. [10] showed that ASST was positive in 53% (51 of
96 patients) whereas APST was positive in 86% (61 of 71). In their
study, 21 of 30 patients (70%) with negative ASST had positive
APST results. However, our study showed that ASST was positive
in 28.1% of the patients (33 of 96), APST was positive in 34.4% (35
of 96) and 8 out of 96 patients (8.3%) with ASST negative had
positive APST.

Recent study also showed evidences of coagulation pathway
activation in patients with negative APST. This suggests that in CU,
the coagulation system is activated irrespective of the subset of the
disease. D-dimer and F1+2 levels were elevated in 7 of 16 patients
with negative APST (43.7%) and correlated with the disease
activities. These levels were higher than the control group but
lower than the APST positive group [21]. Similarly, we also detected
that plasma D-dimer levels were elevated in APST negative group
(29 of 61 patients, 47.5%) and had a positive correlation with the
severity of disease (p < 0.05, r = 0.649). Perhaps plasma D-dimer
is more sensitive than APST. Further studies are required. It should
be noted here that plasma D-dimer levels in the APST positive and
APST negative groups were not statistically different.

Beside activation of the extrinsic pathway, recent study also
showed activation of intrinsic pathway in CIU patients. However,

 

 

103
NSE Atala

D-dimer level is a plasmatic marker for fibrinolysis in coagulation
pathway; we could not determine whether the extrinsic or intrinsic
or both pathways were activated.

In our study, thyroid autoantibodies, anti-nuclear antibodies and
ESR level were also recorded. There were no differences between
plasma D-dimer levels and the results of APST/ASST in patients
with normal and abnormal results in those laboratory tests.

In conclusion, this study showed elevated plasma D-dimer
levels in nearly half of Thai patients with CIU. There was a positive
correlation between plasma D-dimer levels and the severity of
disease activity. Investigation for plasma D-dimer level may be an
alternative way to evaluate disease severity in patients with CIU.
