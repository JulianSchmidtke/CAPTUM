experience symptoms despite receiving standard-of-care
therapy with H,-antihistamines along with 1 or more

add-on therapies.

Objectives: We sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 24
weeks of treatment with omalizumab in patients with persistent
CIU/CSU despite treatment with H,-antihistamines at up to 4
times the approved dose plus H2-antihistamines, leukotriene
receptor antagonists, or both.

Methods: In this phase III study patients were randomized to
receive 6 subcutaneous injections at 4-week intervals of either
300 mg of omalizumab or placebo, followed by a 16-week
observation period. The primary objective of the study was to
evaluate the overall safety of omalizumab compared with
placebo. Efficacy (itch severity, hive, and urticaria activity
scores) was evaluated at weeks 12 and 24.

Results: The overall incidence and severity of adverse events
and serious adverse events were similar between omalizumab
and placebo recipients; the safety profile was consistent with
omalizumab in patients with allergic asthma. At week 12, the
mean change from baseline in weekly itch severity score was
—8.6 (95% CI, —9.3 to —7.8) in the omalizumab group
compared with —4.0 (95% CI, —5.3 to —2.7) in the placebo
group (P <.001). Significant improvements were seen for
additional efficacy end points at week 12; these benefits were
sustained to week 24.

Conclusion: Omalizumab was well tolerated and reduced the
signs and symptoms of CIU/CSU in patients who remained
symptomatic despite the use of H,-antihistamines (up to 4 times
the approved dose) plus H2-antihistamines, leukotriene receptor
antagonists, or both. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2013;132:101-9.)

Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), also referred to as chronic
spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in recent guidelines adopted by
European and global allergy and dermatology associations, is
characterized by itchy hives that occur for at least 6 weeks with or
without angioedema but have no apparent trigger (eg, allergen,
physical event, and drugs). The mainstay of treatment for patients
with CIU/CSU is nonsedating H,-antihistamine therapy.' However, in a significant proportion of patients, symptoms persist

despite treatment with H,-antihistamines, even when administered at up to 4 times the approved dose.** Should updosing of
H,-antihistamines prove unsuccessful as second-line therapy, current European and global guidelines describe several alternative
add-on therapies as third-line treatment options, including leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), cyclosporine, dapsone, H>antihistamines, omalizumab, and methotrexate.’ Cyclosporine
is effective but has the potential for severe side effects, necessitating monitoring of blood pressure and renal function. Most of the
remaining alternatives are based on low-quality clinical evidence.
Oral corticosteroids can be used to treat CIU/CSU exacerbations,
and their use is sometimes unavoidable, but they are not recommended as a long-term treatment option given the potential for severe side effects associated with chronic use.

Omalizumab is a humanized anti-IgE mAb approved for the
treatment of inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe (United
States) or severe (Europe) allergic asthma.” Initial studies suggested that omalizumab improved hives or wheals and pruritus
in patients with CIU/CSU refractory to Hj-antihistamines.’*
These findings were supported by a phase II study (MYSTIQUE),
which included 90 patients with CIU/CSU,’ and an additional
study involving a subgroup of patients with CIU/CSU (n = 49)
with IgE antibodies against thyroperoxidase (X-QUISITE).'°
Omalizumab demonstrated rapid and beneficial effects on the
signs and symptoms of CIU/CSU in both studies.

Subsequently, a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled
trial (Q4882g; Asteria-II; Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01292473)
involving 323 patients was conducted as part of a series of phase
Ill studies designed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of
subcutaneous omalizumab in patients aged 12 to 75 years with
CIU/CSU."! Patients with moderate-to-severe CIU/CSU who remained symptomatic despite receiving a licensed or approved
dose of a second-generation H,-antihistamine had significant improvement in their symptoms when treated with 150 or 300 mg of
omalizumab over 12 weeks (dosing at 4-week intervals) compared with placebo. Efficacy was dose dependent, with the greatest effects seen with the 300-mg dose. No new safety issues or
concerns were identified compared with the known safety profile
of omalizumab in the allergic asthmatic patient population.

The primary objective of the current study was to assess the
safety of omalizumab compared with placebo over 24 weeks
when administered as an add-on therapy in patients with
CIU/CSU whose signs and symptoms persisted despite treatment
with H,-antihistamines (including up to 4 times the approved
dose) plus H>-antihistamines, LTRAs, or both. The efficacy of
omalizumab compared with that of placebo was also assessed.

METHODS
Study design

This global phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, parallel-group study investigated the safety, tolerability, and
efficacy of 300 mg of omalizumab in patients aged 12 to 75 years (18-75
years in Germany) with CIU/CSU who remained symptomatic despite
treatment with H,-antihistamines at up to 4 times the approved dose plus
H,-antihistamines, LTRAs, or both. The study involved a 2-week screening
period, a 24-week treatment period, and a 16-week follow-up period (during
which omalizumab was not administered). Patients from 65 centers were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous injections of either omalizumab
(n = 252) or placebo (n = 84) at intervals of 4 weeks for a total of 24 weeks
(6 doses). Randomization was stratified according to baseline weekly itch severity score (ISS), baseline weight, and study site (see the Methods section in
this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org for further details on the
randomization process). Throughout the treatment period, participants were
required to maintain stable doses of their prerandomization combination therapy with H,-antihistamine treatment plus H>-antihistamines, LTRAs, or both.
For the duration of the study, patients were provided with 25 mg of diphenhydramine as rescue medication for symptom relief (up to a maximum of 3 doses
per 24-hour period or fewer depending on local regulations).

The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board or ethics
committee at each center, and the study was conducted in accordance with US
Food and Drug Administration regulations, the International Conference on
Harmonisation E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and any other
applicable national laws. An independent data-monitoring committee monitored the study conduct and reviewed blinded and unblinded safety data every
6 months for the duration of the study.

Study population

Patients were eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: 12 to
75 years old (18-75 years old in Germany); CIU/CSU for 6 months or longer;
itch and hives for more than 6 consecutive weeks before enrollment despite
therapy with H,-antihistamines plus H>-antihistamines, LTRAs, or both; an
urticaria activity score (UAS) over 7 days (UAS7) of 16 or greater (on a scale
ranging from 0-42, with higher scores indicating greater activity)'? and a
weekly ISS of 8 or greater (range, 0-21) during 7 days before randomization
obtained from a daily symptom electronic diary (eDiary) completed by the patient'*'4; an in-clinic physician-assessed UAS (range, 0-6) of 4 or greater on
one of the screening visit days (days — 14, —7, or 1); treatment with a regimen
that included an H,-antihistamine (up to 4 times the approved dosage) plus
H>-antihistamines, LTRAs, or both Hp-antihistamines and LTRAs for
CIU/CSU for 3 or more consecutive days immediately before day —14;
willingness and ability to complete a daily symptom eDiary throughout the
study; and no missing eDiary entries in the 7 days before randomization.

Key exclusion criteria comprised the following: a clearly defined underlying cause for chronic urticaria (eg, physical urticaria); doses administered
daily or every other day for 5 or more consecutive days of systemic or topical
corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, or intravenous immunoglobulin within 30 days before day —14;
history of malignancy; hypersensitivity to omalizumab; treatment with
omalizumab within the previous year; evidence of parasitic infection; history
of anaphylactic shock; or women who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or of
childbearing potential and not using acceptable contraception.

Written informed consent was obtained from each participant or the
participant’s parent or legal guardian (if participant was <18 years of age)
before they were included in the study.

Assessments

Each patient completed the Urticaria Patient Daily Diary'*'* by using an
eDiary for the duration of the study, recording ISSs (0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; and 3, severe), number of hives (0, none; 1, 1-6 hives; 2, 7-12 hives; and
3, >12 hives), and size of the largest hive (0, none; 1, <1.25 cm; 2, 1.25-2.5 cm;
and 3, >2.5 cm) twice daily; sleep and daily activity interference

and weeks 12 and 40; the CU-Q.oL was completed at baseline and weeks 4,
12, 24, and 40. The 10 items of the DLQI are rated to produce a total score
of 0 to 30,'*:'° with higher scores indicating a reduced quality of life, whereas
the 23 items on the CU-Q,oL result in a score of 0 to 100, with higher scores
indicating improved quality of life.

 

 

and

Study end points

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety of 300 mg of
omalizumab compared with placebo by assessing the following over the
24-week treatment period: the incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs)
and serious AEs and changes in vital signs and clinical laboratory evaluations
(see the Methods section in this article’s Online Repository for the definition of

serious AEs). Anti-omalizumab antibody data were evaluated at the end of the
study (week 40). Safety analyses for the 16-week follow-up period were also
performed.

The key efficacy end point was the change from baseline in mean weekly
ISSs at week 12. Additional efficacy end points evaluated at week 12 included
the following: changes from baseline in the UAS7 (itch severity and number of
hives scores averaged each day and then totaled each week were used to
determine the UAS7),!? weekly number of hives score, weekly size of largest
hive score, and health-related quality of life, as measured by using the DLQI,
time to achieve a minimally important difference (MID) in weekly ISS (reduction from baseline of >5 points)'?; proportion of patients with UAS7s of 6 or
less; proportion of patients with change from baseline in mean ISSs of 5 or
greater (MID); proportion of angioedema-free days from weeks 4 to 12; and
proportion of patients who were hive and itch free (UAS7 = 0) at week 12.

Exploratory end points evaluated at week 12 included the following: change
from baseline in rescue medication use (diphenhydramine); change from
baseline in health-related quality of life, as measured by using the CU-Q,0L;
time to achieve an MID on the UAS7 (reduction from baseline of >11 points);
daily activity and sleep interference; and 13 prespecified subgroup analyses
(including sex, age, race, region, baseline weekly ISS, baseline UAS7, body
weight, positive chronic urticaria index test result for anti-FceRI autoantibody
at baseline, angioedema at baseline, previous use of CIU/CSU therapies, and
duration of disease). Exploratory end points were also evaluated at week 24
(see the Methods section in this article’s Online Repository for details).

Statistical analyses

The safety analyses were conducted in all patients who were randomized
and received at least 1 dose of the study treatment, with patients analyzed
according to the treatment actually received (safety evaluable population).
The intention-to-treat population comprised all randomized patients, regardless of whether they received the study drug. The efficacy analyses for the
treatment period were conducted in all patients who were randomized and
received at least 1 dose of study drug (ie, the modified intention-to-treat
population), according to the treatment the patient was assigned to receive.

For the key efficacy end point, differences between the omalizumab and
placebo groups were analyzed by using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
model stratified according to baseline weekly ISS (<13 vs 213) and baseline
weight (<80 vs 280 kg). The strata were predefined based on the medians
reported in a phase II clinical study.” Missing data at week 12 were imputed
with the baseline score (baseline observation carried forward); sensitivity
analyses with 2 multiple imputation methods were also conducted. Details
of the sensitivity analyses are provided in the Methods section in this article’s
Online Repository. Treatment differences were presented as least squares
means (LSMs), along with corresponding 95% CIs and P values. Analysis
of additional end points evaluating change from baseline was similar to that
of the key efficacy end point, with treatment differences derived from
ANCOVA models stratified by baseline score for the respective end point
(less than the median vs median or greater) and baseline weight (<80 vs >80
kg). Additional details on the statistical methods and sample size calculation
are provided in the Methods section in this article’s Online Repository.

RESULTS
Patients

Of 480 patients screened, 336 were randomized to treatment,
although 1 patient did not receive the study drug. As a result,
safety and efficacy were evaluated in 335 patients (modified
intention-to-treat population). In total, 290 (86.3%) completed
the study (Fig 1). Mean duration of drug exposure was 22.4 weeks
(SD, 4.7 weeks) in the omalizumab-treated group and 20.6 weeks
(SD, 6.4 weeks) in the placebo-treated group. Patients in the omalizumab and placebo groups received a mean of 5.6 (SD, 1.2) and
5.1 (SD, 1.6) doses, respectively.

Study discontinuation (patient stopped receiving study drug
before completing the protocol-defined study schedule: 11.1% vs
21.4%) and treatment discontinuation (patient stopped receiving
study drug before completing the protocol-defined treatment
schedule: 12.3% vs 25.0%) rates were approximately 2-fold lower
in omalizumab versus placebo recipients. Over the 40-week study
period, the most common reasons for study discontinuation were
disease progression (4.4% vs 9.5%) and subject/legal guardian
decision to discontinue treatment (4.0% vs 9.5%). The most
common reasons for treatment discontinuation were disease
progression (4.4% vs 10.7%) and AEs (4.8% vs 7.1%, with
idiopathic urticaria being the most common).

Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were similar
across treatment groups (Table I). For the overall population, mean
age was 43.1 years (SD, 14.1 years), 71.9% were female, mean
body mass index was 29.8 kg/m? (SD, 7.8 kg/m?), and mean and
median IgE levels were 158.5 [U/mL (SD, 287.7 IU/mL) and
78.0 [U/mL (range, 1-3050 IU/mL), respectively. Mean time since
diagnosis of CIU/CSU was 7.4 years (SD, 9.5 years), and the mean
number of previous CIU/CSU medications was 6.0 (SD, 2.6). At
baseline, most patients were receiving either dual therapy with
H,-antihistamines and H-antihistamines (55.5%) or triple therapy
with H,-antihistamines plus H-antihistamines plus LTRAs
(26.6%); a minority of patients were receiving H,-antihistamines

defined as >1 daily entry) during the treatment period (see Table

percentages of days with a diary entry were similar between the
treatment groups.

Safety

During the 40-week study period (24-week treatment and
16-week follow-up period), the incidence and severity of AEs and
serious AEs were similar between omalizumab and placebo
recipients, with no new omalizumab safety issues identified. In
omalizumab and placebo recipients the percentages of patients
experiencing at least 1 AE, AEs reported as suspected to be caused
by study drug, and serious AEs were 83.7% versus 78.3%, 11.1%
versus 13.3%, and 7.1% versus 6.0%, respectively (Table II).

The incidence of AEs was similar for the omalizumab and
placebo groups during the 24-week treatment period (65.1% vs
63.9%). Across both treatment groups, treatment-emergent AEs in
the following MedDRA system organ classes occurred most
frequently (>3% in any group): infections and infestations, skin
and subcutaneous disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders

more common in the omalizumab group, whereas sinus congestion,
migraine, and idiopathic urticaria were more common in the
placebo group. The incidence of AEs was also similar for the omalizumab and placebo groups during the 16-week follow-up period
(52.0% vs 47.0%). During the 16-week follow-up period, upper
respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, and idiopathic
urticaria were reported more frequently in the omalizumab group,
whereas nasal congestion was more common with placebo.

Serious AEs were reported by 23 (6.9%) patients during the
40-week study period (18 [7.1%] patients in the omalizumab
group and 5 [6.0%] patients in the placebo group). No serious AEs
were suspected to be caused by the study drug. During the
treatment period, serious AEs occurred in 7 (2.8%) omalizumab
recipients and 3 (3.6%) placebo recipients (Table IV). During
follow-up (after study drug withdrawal), treatment-emergent serious AEs occurred in 11 (4.4%) patients in the omalizumab group
and 2 (2.4%) in the placebo group (Table IV).

No anaphylactic reactions, malignancies, or deaths occurred
during the whole study, and there was no evidence of any
clinically meaningful trends in laboratory parameters or vital
signs associated with omalizumab therapy. No patients had
anti-omalizumab antibodies, levels of which were measured at
week 40.

Efficacy

The mean change from baseline in weekly ISS at week 12 (key
efficacy end point) was significantly improved in the omalizumab
group compared with that in the placebo group (—8.6 vs —4.0, P<
.001, Fig 2 and Table V). This significant efficacy benefit with

omalizumab was sustained to week 24 (— 8.6 vs —4.0; LSM treatment difference, —4.5 [95% CI, —6.1 to —3.0]; P <.001). After
week 24 and until week 40 (ie, during the follow-up period),
the mean weekly ISS in the omalizumab group gradually increased to values similar to those in the placebo group but did
not return to baseline values throughout the follow-up period;
however, there were no statistical differences between the omalizumab and placebo groups at week 40. Sensitivity analyses conducted for the key efficacy end point were consistent with the
primary analyses (see Table E2 in this article’s Online Repository
at www.jacionline.org).

Significant improvements with omalizumab versus placebo
were seen for all additional efficacy end points (changes from
baseline in UAS7; weekly number of hives score; weekly size of
largest hive score; DLQI; time to achieve the MID response in
weekly ISS; proportion of patients with a UAS7 <6; proportion of
patients with change from baseline in mean ISS of >5 [MID];
proportion of angioedema-free days from weeks 4 to 12; and
proportion of patients who were itch and hive free [UAS7 = 0];
Fig 3 and Table V and Figs E1 and E2 in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). A significantly greater number of
patients in the omalizumab group were completely itch and hive
free (UAS7 = 0) at week 12 compared with the placebo group
(34% vs 5%, P <.001, Table V). Similar to the key efficacy end
point, significant improvements in additional efficacy end points
seen with omalizumab at week 12 were maintained at week 24;
however, after discontinuation of omalizumab, improvements observed during the treatment period decreased such that values
were similar to placebo values by week 40 (data not shown).

In the exploratory analyses the reduction from baseline in the
mean CU-Q,0L score was significantly greater with omalizumab
versus placebo at week 12 (—29.3 vs — 16.3; LSM treatment difference, — 13.4 [95% Cl, —18.2 to —8.6]; P <.001) and week 24
(—30.9 vs —16.3; LSM treatment difference, —14.6 [95% CI,
—19.7 to —9.5]; P <.001). At week 12, mean change from baseline in rescue medication was numerically reduced with omalizumab, but the difference versus placebo did not reach statistical
significance (—3.9 vs —2.7; LSM treatment difference, —1.2
[95% CI, —2.7 to 0.42]; P = .150).

Overall, the prespecified subgroup analyses for the key end
point demonstrated that the efficacy of omalizumab was maintained across patient subgroups (see Fig E3 in this article’s Online

Repository at www.jacionline.org). Of note, omalizumab was effective, irrespective of the combination of protocol-approved concomitant CIU/CSU medications. Small sample sizes precluded
meaningful interpretation of the results in some subgroups
(patients who were aged <18 years, were nonwhite, or received
2 or less previous CIU/CSU medications).

DISCUSSION

The safety and tolerability of omalizumab in patients with CIU/
CSU has been observed in this phase III study. Patients with CIU/
CSU who remained symptomatic despite treatment with H,-antihistamines (up to 4 times approved or licensed dose) plus either
108 KAPLAN ET AL

H,-antihistamines, LTRAs, or both had 300 mg of omalizumab
administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks, and the incidences
of AEs and serious AEs were similar in both the omalizumaband placebo-treated groups. No new safety issues or concerns
were identified. AEs of headache and upper respiratory tract infections were reported more frequently with omalizumab than placebo;
AEs of idiopathic urticaria were reported more frequently with placebo than omalizumab. Omalizumab was well tolerated. Study discontinuation and drug withdrawal were approximately 2-fold lower
in the omalizumab group compared with the placebo group.
There was statistically significant efficacy with 300 mg of
omalizumab. This was observed compared with placebo by
the change from baseline in weekly ISS (key efficacy end point)
and in all other efficacy end points at week 12, including an
improvement in days free from angioedema. These significant
improvements were sustained throughout the 24-week treatment
period. Furthermore, omalizumab was associated with consistent
improvements in the key efficacy end point across a number of
prespecified subgroups, including those defined according to
concomitant CIU/CSU medication use. After discontinuation of
omalizumab, symptoms gradually recurred over a period of about
10 weeks to levels similar to those observed with placebo.
These results support those of another placebo-controlled phase
Ill study, which investigated the efficacy and safety of 3 doses of
omalizumab compared with placebo in patients with CIU/CSU
who remained symptomatic despite the use of approved doses of
H,-antihistamines.' Patients receiving 150 or 300 mg of omalizumab administered every 4 weeks experienced significant and dosedependent reductions in symptoms over 12 weeks compared with
those receiving placebo, with gradual symptom recurrence after
omalizumab discontinuation, and the incidence of AEs was similar
across the treatment groups. However, it is important to note that
the present study has a longer duration (24 weeks) and includes patients who remain symptomatic despite H,-antihistamine therapy
at up to 4 times the approved dose plus an H,-antihistamine, an
LTRA, or both, a combination of treatments that is frequently
used in the clinical setting. It should also be noted that the efficacy
of omalizumab was similar regardless of therapy at baseline.
Several studies suggest that the quality of life in patients with
CIU/CSU remains measurably impaired, despite the presence of
only moderate ISSs.'*!° Thus to achieve a meaningful treatment response from the perspective of patients, symptoms
must be reduced to a minimum or be absent entirely. In fact,
current treatment guidelines explicitly state that “the goal of
treatment is to achieve the absence of and complete protection
from symptoms.”?° Symptoms discussed in treatment guidelines
include not only itch severity but also the presence of hives, angioedema, or both. In that regard treatment response as measured based on the UAS7, which includes numbers of hives in
addition to itch severity, might be a particularly relevant efficacy
end point. To assess completeness of response, 2 responder definitions (UAS7 < 6 and UAS7 = 0) were included as efficacy
end points in this study. A UAS7 of 6 or less reflects minimal
symptoms and might be useful in identifying those patients
with a good clinical response. A UAS7 of 0 reflects complete
resolution of symptoms, which represents the most desirable
outcome. This study shows that approximately half of the patients who received add-on omalizumab achieved UAS7s of 6
or less, and one third were completely itch and hive free
(UAS7 = 0). A limitation of the UAS7 is that non—-urticaria-related itch might be recorded, and as such, a greater number of

J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL

patients might have achieved a complete reduction of symptoms
while receiving omalizumab.

Apart from reducing free IgE levels, the additional mechanisms
by which omalizumab works in patients with CIU/CSU remains
unclear. Reports describe patients with CIU/CSU as having
abnormal basophil function, including decreased responsiveness
to stimuli acting through the IgE receptor (50% of patients), blood
basopenia, and recruitment of basophils into skin lesions.*! With
successful therapy, blood basopenia and FceRI function began to
return to normal levels.”! In previous studies the binding of circulating IgE by omalizumab reduces free IgE levels within hours after
administration and downregulates FceRI on blood basophils within
2 weeks; in nasal mast cells reduction in FceRI expression and
degranulation typically occurs after 8 weeks,??** whereas a study
of human cutaneous mast cells indicates a downregulatory effect in
3 to 4 weeks.”° However, in individual patients the time course of
symptom control does not necessarily follow these parameters.
Although this study was not designed to further elucidate the mechanism of action of omalizumab on basophils or cutaneous mast
cells, ongoing research aims to provide a better understanding of
how omalizumab treatment alleviates the symptoms of CIU/CSU.

In conclusion, the results support omalizumab as a welltolerated and effective treatment option for patients with
CIU/CSU who remain symptomatic despite treatment with
multiple background therapies of H;-antihistamines and H>-antihistamines, LTRAs, or both.

We thank all the clinical trial investigators, staff, and patients who
participated in the study. We also thank Yanan Zheng of Genentech, Inc for
advice regarding the PK/PD analysis and Merdad Parsey of Genentech, Inc
and Robert Maykut and Panayiotis Georgiou of Novartis for their advice
regarding study design. Editorial support and assistance with incorporation of
revisions was provided by professional medical writer Brian Jepson, PhD
(CircleScience), who was funded by Genentech, Inc and Novartis Pharma.

Clinical implications: Omalizumab is well tolerated and efficacious in the treatment of patients with CIU/CSU who remain

symptomatic despite receiving H,-antihistamines at up to 4
times the approved dose plus H2-antagonists, LTRAs, or both.
