Abstract

Background: Approximately 50% of patients with chronic idiopathic/spontaneous
urticaria (CIU/CSU) report hives and angioedema; some experience hives/
angioedema only.

Objective: Assess omalizumab’s effect on angioedema and quality of life (QoL) in
subgroups with refractory CIU/CSU: those with and without angioedema.

Methods: Patients received omalizumab (75, 150 or 300 mg) or placebo every

4 weeks for 12/24 weeks. Angioedema and QoL was assessed (Urticaria Patient
Daily Diary and Dermatology Quality of Life Index [DLQI]). Subgroups were based on
the presence/absence of baseline angioedema 7 days prior to randomization.
Results: Patients with baseline angioedema randomized to omalizumab 300 mg had
a greater reduction in mean weekly incidence of angioedema and mean number of
days/week with angioedema versus placebo at 12- and 24-weeks. A 3.3- to 4.5-point
greater mean reduction in DLQI score was achieved with omalizumab 300 mg
treatment versus placebo, above the minimal clinically important difference

threshold. Results with lower doses versus placebo were variable.

Conclusion: Compared with placebo, omalizumab 300 mg treatment over 12-24
weeks resulted in marked reduction in incidence and number of days/week with

angioedema accompanied by clinically relevant improvement in QoL.

Introduction

Patients with chronic idiopathic/spontaneous urticaria (CIU/CSU) experience
recurrent episodes of wheals (hives) and/or angioedema for at least 6 weeks.”
Hives present as pruritic wheals of variable size with surrounding erythema.”
Individual hives are transient, typically resolving within 24 hours of onset.”
Angioedema is characterized by rapidly occurring swellings of the lower dermis and
subcutis, and often involves mucous membranes.” The swellings may be
erythematous or skin-colored, and sometimes painful, typically taking up to 72 hours

to resolve.”

Estimates of the proportion of patients with CIU/CSU experiencing both hives and
angioedema, and those reporting either symptom in isolation vary: 33-67% of
patients experience both symptoms; 29-65% experience hives only; and 1-13%
experience angioedema only.’ In the latter group, hereditary angioedema due to C1inhibitor deficiency, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-mediated angioedema
and other forms of bradykinin-mediated angioedema need to be excluded before

confirming a diagnosis of CIU/CSU.*

The signs and symptoms of CIU/CSU have a detrimental impact on patients’ healthrelated quality of life (QoL).>’ In addition, the presence of angioedema in patients
with CIU/CSU is associated with a prolonged disease duration, with a greater
proportion remaining symptomatic beyond 1 year compared with those experiencing

hives only (64-70% versus 43-48%, respectively).> ® °

The current first-line therapy for patients with CIU/CSU is non-sedating secondgeneration H,-antihistamines.' H;-antihistamines provide complete symptomatic
relief in <50% of all cases, so there remains an unmet need for a more targeted or
optimal therapy in the majority of patients. Omalizumab, a humanized antiimmunoglobulin E monoclonal antibody, is approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adults and adolescents (212 years of age)
with CIU/CSU who remain symptomatic despite H,-antihistamine treatment.'°
Approval of omalizumab in this indication was based on the efficacy and safety
findings from three Phase III clinical studies (ASTERIA | [NCT01287117], ASTERIA
Il [NCT01292473] and GLACIAL [NCT01264939]).'"'S In these studies, omalizumab
300 mg and 150 mg was shown to significantly improve weekly itch severity score
and change from baseline in urticaria activity score over 7 days (UAS7) to Week 12
compared with placebo.’ Omalizumab 75 mg was also shown to significantly

improve these efficacy variables in the ASTERIA | trial."

Angioedema is more common in patients with CIU/CSU unresponsive to treatment
with up to four-times the approved dose of H1-antihistamines compared with patients
responsive to treatment (59% versus 29%, respectively). "4 In the Phase III studies,

the efficacy of omalizumab on angioedema, specifically, the proportion of

angioedema-free days, and QoL, assessed using the Dermatology Life Quality Index
(DLQI), were investigated as secondary efficacy outcomes.''* Analyses of data
from the subgroup of patients with CIU/CSU who had angioedema at baseline in
these trials provides an opportunity to further investigate patient-reported

angioedema and QoL with omalizumab compared with placebo.

Objective

The objective of the current analysis of data from the Phase III studies was to
investigate patient-reported angioedema and QoL (DLQI scores) during treatment
with omalizumab versus placebo in those patients who had angioedema at baseline.
All data refer to pooled analyses of ASTERIA I, ASTERIA II and GLACIAL, unless

specifically stated.

Methods

Patients and study design

ASTERIA I, ASTERIA II and GLACIAL were multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled studies of omalizumab in patients with CIU/CSU who remained
symptomatic despite treatment with approved doses of H;-antihistamines (ASTERIA
I/Il) or Hy-antihistamines (up to four-times approved dose), H2-receptor antagonists

and/or leukotriene-receptor antagonists (GLACIAL).'"

The full methodology of these trials has been published previously.'*"° Briefly, in all
three studies, patients were aged 12-75 years (18-75 years in Germany), with a
diagnosis of CIU/CSU for 26 months; presence of itch and hives for 28 consecutive

weeks (>6 consecutive weeks in GLACIAL) prior to enrollment despite treatment; an

UAS7 216 and a weekly itch severity score (ISS) 28 for the 7 days before
randomization; and an in-clinic urticaria activity score (UAS) 24 on at least one of the
screening visits (Day -14, -7 or 1).'"' Patients were required to have received an
approved dose of an H;-antihistamine (ASTERIA I/II) or an H,-antihistamine at up to
four-times approved dose, and an H2-receptor antagonist and/or leukotriene-receptor
antagonist (GLACIAL) for CIU/CSU for 23 consecutive days prior to Day -14
screening visit, and documented current use at the initial screening visit.'""'* Patients
were excluded from the study if they presented with a disease with urticaria or
angioedema symptoms (other than CIU/CSU), including hereditary or acquired

angioedema.'*"3

Eligible patients received subcutaneous omalizumab (75, 150 or 300 mg) or placebo
every 4 weeks for 24 weeks in ASTERIA | and 12 weeks in ASTERIA II."" 1? In
GLACIAL, patients received subcutaneous omalizumab 300 mg or placebo every 4

weeks for 24 weeks. ?

All three studies were conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice
guidelines, US FDA regulations and any other national applicable laws. All patients
(or their parents/legal guardian if under 18 years of age) provided informed written

consent before participation.

Outcomes and statistical analysis
In all three studies, the presence of angioedema was assessed at baseline and
throughout the study using the Urticaria Patient Daily Diary (UPDD; component:

angioedema — ‘yes’ or ‘no’). In the current retrospective analysis, patients were

subdivided according to whether or not they experienced angioedema at baseline,
defined as the presence of angioedema on at least 1 day during the 7 days prior to,

but not including, the day of first treatment.

Baseline demographics and patient characteristics were summarized for the
subgroup of patients with angioedema at baseline and the subgroup of patients

without angioedema at baseline.

For the subgroup of patients with angioedema at baseline, the number of days per
week with angioedema and the proportion of patients who were angioedema-free
each week were calculated from baseline to Week 12 (all 3 studies), and Week 24
(ASTERIA | and GLACIAL [pooled]), based on information entered in the UPDD. The
proportion of angioedema-free days was calculated from Week 4 to Week 12 for all
three studies and from Week 4 to Week 24 for ASTERIA | and GLACIAL (pooled),
and was analyzed using a stratified Wilcoxon rank-sum test, with baseline weight
(<80 kg, 280 kg) as the stratification variable. Summary statistics included the mean
(standard deviation; SD) number of days with angioedema with omalizumab or

placebo, by week.

The change from baseline to Week 12 (weekly; all 3 studies) and Week 24 (weekly;
ASTERIA | and GLACIAL [pooled]) in the overall DLQI score was also calculated for
patients with and without angioedema at baseline. Change from baseline in overall
DLQI score was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with
baseline overall DLQI score as a covariate and baseline weight (<80 kg versus 280

kg) as strata. P-values and 95% confidence intervals comparing the treatment

difference in least squares means with omalizumab relative to placebo were derived

from the ANCOVA model.

Efficacy analyses were based on the modified intent-to-treat population (observed
data), which included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of

study drug, with no imputation for missing scores.

All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS, Version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc,

Cary, NC, USA).

Results

Patient characteristics and demographics

Overall, 460 out of 975 patients (47.2%) in the pooled population experienced
angioedema at baseline. The demographics of the subgroup with baseline

angioedema were similar to the subgroup without baseline angioedema (Table 1).

Positive results on the Chronic Urticaria Index™ test, as assessed by in vitro
basophil histamine assay, were seen more frequently in patients with baseline

angioedema compared with those without angioedema (38.4% vs 19.7%).

By contrast, baseline clinical disease activities, including the size and number of
hives, itch intensity and interference with sleep and daily activities, disease duration
and QoL impairment were similar in patients with or without baseline angioedema
(Table 1). There were no notable differences in previous CIU/CSU medications,
which most commonly included steroids, H2-receptor antagonists, leukotriene
receptor antagonists and immunosuppressants (Table 2). Prior medical conditions

occurred at similar frequencies in patients with or without angioedema and most

commonly included a prior diagnosis of allergic rhinitis and asthma (Table 3).

Number of days per week with angioedema

The mean number of days per week with angioedema was reduced with omalizumab
and placebo by Week 12 (Fig. 1A). At baseline, patients in the omalizumab 300-mg
group experienced angioedema for a mean (SD) of 3.5 (2.2) days, falling to 0.8 (1.8)
days by Week 12. Corresponding values for the omalizumab 150-mg, omalizumab
75-mg, and placebo groups were: 3.6 (2.1) and 1.1 (1.9); 3.8 (2.1) and 1.3 (2.2); and

3.1 (1.9) and 1.3 (1.8) days, respectively.

A reduction in the mean number of days per week with angioedema (SD) was
observed in the omalizumab 300-mg group at Week 24 (ASTERIA | and GLACIAL
pooled; baseline, 3.5 [2.2]; Week 24, 0.6 [1.5]) and placebo group (baseline, 3.0
[1.8]; Week 24: 1.0 [1.8]). Considering the omalizumab 150-mg and 75-mg groups
(ASTERIA I only), the mean number of days per week with angioedema with
omalizumab 150 mg at baseline was 3.7 (2.0) and at Week 24 was 0.4 (1.1), and
with omalizumab 75 mg at baseline was 3.8 (2.3) and at Week 24 was 2.5 (2.8).

(Fig. 1B).

Angioedema-free patients each week

A consistent reduction in the number of patients with angioedema was observed in
the omalizumab groups compared with placebo. The proportion of patients with
angioedema was reduced from 100% at baseline in all groups to 26.3% in the

omalizumab 300-mg group, 34.5% in the omalizumab 150-mg group, 39.2% in the

omalizumab 75-mg group, and 47.8% in the placebo group at Week 12 of the study

(Fig. 2).

Proportion of angioedema-free days

During Weeks 4 to 12, the mean (SD) proportion of angioedema-free days was
higher in the omalizumab groups, significantly so with the 300-mg dose, than in the
placebo group (Table 4). Results were similar for Weeks 4 to 24 in ASTERIA | and

GLACIAL (pooled).

QoL (DLQI) in patients with and without baseline angioedema

Omalizumab treatment with 300 mg, but not 150 or 75 mg, significantly improved
DLQI scores in patients with and without baseline angioedema compared with
placebo (Fig. 3, Table 5). Patients with and without baseline angioedema showed
similar improvement on DLQI scores in response to omalizumab treatment (Fig. 3,

Table 5).

Discussion

In this post hoc analysis of pooled data from the pivotal clinical studies ASTERIA I,
ASTERIA Il and GLACIAL for patients with angioedema at baseline, patient-reported
angioedema was reduced and QoL significantly improved with omalizumab versus
placebo, after 12 (all 3 studies) and 24 weeks (ASTERIA | and GLACIAL pooled) of
treatment. The greatest clinical benefit in patients with baseline angioedema was
observed in the omalizumab 300-mg and 150-mg groups. By contrast, omalizumab

75 mg did not generally improve outcomes over placebo.

In all groups, patients had angioedema at baseline for about 3.5 days per week; after
receiving monthly doses of omalizumab 300 mg and 150 mg for 12 weeks this had
declined to 0.8 and 1.1 days per week, respectively, and was further reduced to 0.6
and 0.4 days per week, respectively, by 24 weeks of treatment in the pooled
ASTERIA | and GLACIAL analysis. The reduction of angioedema to around 0.5 days
per week with omalizumab 150-300 mg exceeded that observed with placebo,
where patients had angioedema for 1.3 and 1.0 days per week at Week 12 and

Week 24, respectively, of the pooled analyses.

In the subgroup of patients with baseline angioedema, the proportion of patients who
continued to report angioedema declined in the placebo group throughout the study,
and accounted for only 47.8% of patients at Week 12. The self-resolution and
reduced recurrence of angioedema in a proportion of patients receiving placebo
highlights the transient nature of angioedema episodes; however, a greater reduction
in angioedema episodes was observed with omalizumab compared with placebo,
with fewer patients reporting an angioedema episode each week with omalizumab
300 mg throughout the 12-week pooled analysis. By Week 12, omalizumab 300 mg

had reduced the proportion of patients with angioedema to 26.3%.

Omalizumab 300 mg was the only dosing regimen that was more efficacious than
placebo in improving the QoL for patients with baseline angioedema. In the pooled
analyses, a 3.3- to 4.5-point greater reduction in DLQI score was achieved with 12—
24 weeks of omalizumab 300 mg treatment versus placebo. The difference in
change in DLQI score between the omalizumab 300 mg and placebo groups was

above the previously defined minimal clinically important difference threshold of 2.2—

3.1 points, indicating a clinically meaningful benefit with omalizumab treatment; '®
improvement in DLQI with omalizumab 300 mg was similar for patients without
angioedema at baseline (2.6—3.6 points above that achieved with placebo). The
observation that the benefits of omalizumab on QoL were similar in both subgroups
of patients is perhaps not surprising if we consider that it is likely the emotional
aspect i.e. fear/anxiety of a subsequent angioedema attack that has most impact on
patient QoL. This emotional impact on QoL has been highlighted by results from
studies utilizing the Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire, the first specific
patient-reported outcome assessment of QoL in patients with recurrent angioedema,
and in an European study assessing the real-world experience of patients with
hereditary angioedema.'*'® Therefore, it would be of interest in future CIU/CSU
subgroup analyses to investigate patients who have experienced angioedema
versus those who have never experienced angioedema. In addition, studies on the
minority of patients with CIU/CSU who have angioedema in isolation (i.e. in the

absence of hives) are warranted.

It is reassuring that the findings from this post hoc pooled analysis are consistent
with the greater efficacy and improvement in QoL observed with omalizumab 300 mg
compared with placebo observed during the individual trials.'"'*: '? Caution is
warranted in the interpretation of the results from the ASTERIA | and GLACIAL
pooled analysis for the omalizumab 75-mg and 150-mg groups as these dosing
regimens were not included in the GLACIAL study.‘ Indeed, the highly fluctuating
burden of angioedema (measured as days per week with angioedema) observed
with omalizumab 75 mg in the 24-week ASTERIA | and GLACIAL pooled data are a

notable exception to the overall observed benefit of omalizumab treatment in these

post hoc analyses, and may be a result of the small sample size in the omalizumab

75-mg data set.

Additional limitations of this study include the unavoidable subjectivity of patientreported outcomes. Patients were assessed for the presence or absence of
angioedema during a baseline period defined as the 7 days prior to randomization.
However, the transitory nature of angioedema episodes means that some patients
could have been mis-classified as angioedema-free and later gone on to experience
angioedema; likewise, patients with angioedema during the baseline period could
have been experiencing a single, self-resolving episode without recurrence during
the study period. Furthermore, facial wheals can be difficult to distinguish from
angioedema, which may potentially increase the incidence of reported angioedema
during the baseline assessment and therefore suggest a greater response with
omalizumab than that actually achieved. Future studies of omalizumab on
angioedema should try to account for this through measurements of the site, size,

severity and duration of wheals.

Omalizumab represents an important add-on treatment option for the approximately
50% of CIU/CSU cases that remain symptomatic on H.-antihistamine therapy.? The
observation that angioedema is more common in these patients compared with
patients responsive to treatment highlights the importance of angioedema as a
clinical marker of symptom burden in CIU/CSU."* The steady and consistently
greater decline in incidence and number of days per week with angioedema with
omalizumab 300 mg compared with placebo in these 12- and 24-week pooled

analyses, accompanied by a clinically relevant improvement in QoL, is strongly
