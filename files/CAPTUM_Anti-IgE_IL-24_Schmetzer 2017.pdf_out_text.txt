Background: The efficacy of omalizumab (anti-IgE) and
increased IgE levels in patients with chronic spontaneous
urticaria (CSU) suggest autoallergic mechanisms.

Objective: We sought to identify autoallergic targets of IgE in
patients with CSU.

Methods: Serum samples of patients with CSU together with
those of patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis and healthy
control subjects (7 of each) were screened for IgE
autoantibodies by using an array of more than 9000 proteins.
Sera of 1062 patients with CSU and 482 healthy control subjects
were used in an IgE-anti-IL-24-specific ELISA to investigate
the association of IgE-anti-IL-24 and CSU.

Results: By using array analyses, more than 200 IgE
autoantigens were found in patients with CSU that were not
found in control subjects. Of the 31 IgE autoantigens detected in
more than 70% of patients, 8 were soluble or membrane bound
and expressed in the skin. Of these, only IgE autoantibodies to
IL-24 were found in all patients with CSU. In vitro studies
showed IL-24 to release histamine from human mast cells
sensitized with purified IgE of patients with CSU but not control
subjects. By using ELISA, mean + SD levels of IgE-anti-IL-24
were 0.52 + 0.24 IU/mL in patients with CSU and 0.27 + 0.08
IU/mL in control subjects, with 80% of patients with CSU but
only 20% of control subjects having levels greater than 0.33 IU/
mL (P <.0001). IgE-anti-IL-24 showed acceptable predictive
properties for CSU, with a likelihood ratio of 3.9. Clinically,
IgE-anti-IL-24 levels showed an association with disease

reduced basophil counts.

Conclusion: Our findings show that patients with CSU
frequently exhibit IgE autoantibodies against many
autoantigens and that IL-24 is a common, specific, and
functional autoantigen of IgE antibodies in patients with CSU.

It has been 75 years since it was first suggested that the
production of wheals in patients with urticaria might have an
underlying allergic mechanism.' Certainly, the effectiveness of
H,-antihistamines in patients with urticaria? would support
this hypothesis, even though no obvious extrinsic allergens
have been identified. This prompted Rorsman* to suggest urticaria to be an autoallergy (ie, type I hypersensitivity to selfallergens). The involvement of IgE in patients with urticaria
was suggested from 2 sources. First is the association of chronic
spontaneous urticaria (CSU) with high levels of total IgE and
increased levels of IgE directed, for example, against thyroid
antigens and double-stranded DNA.*° Second is the effectiveness of omalizumab (anti-IgE) in relieving the symptoms of
csuU.’

In patients with other autoimmune conditions, such as systemic
lupus erythematosus, the disease is complex and characterized by
production of autoantibodies to a broad range of self-antigens.”
For example, in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus,
IgE antibodies specific for double-stranded DNA have been suggested to stimulate plasmacytoid dendritic cells, an immune cell
linked to viral defense, to secrete substantial amounts of IFN-«.”

We postulate that CSU is an autoimmune disease in which IgE
recognizes several autoantigens that are probably primarily
dermal in origin. Low-level diffusion of these into the bloodstream would be consistent with the basopenia seen in patients
with CSU.*'° Furthermore, periods of increased local generation
of such allergens would explain the localized exacerbations of
CSU.

To test this hypothesis, large-scale screening of autoreactive
IgE in the serum of patients with CSU was used to explore
potential targets of IgE autoantibodies (IgE-AAbs) in patients
with this disease. IgE present in sera from patients with idiopathic
anaphylaxis (IdA) and healthy subjects was used as a control. The
association of the primary IgE autoantibody was further investigated both in vitro and clinically.

METHODS

Serum from patients with CSU and control subjects

We analyzed 1062 patients with CSU (73% female), 7 patients with IdA
(57% female), and 482 healthy control subjects (61% female). There was no
significant difference between the ages of patients with CSU (mean + SD,
44.0 + 14.7 years), patients with IdA (44.4 + 13 years), and healthy control
subjects (46.9 + 16.7 years).

All patients were treated at our specialized outpatient clinic for dermatologic allergology. They were given a diagnosis of CSU or IdA in line with the
current World Allergy Organization “Guidelines for the assessment and
management of anaphylaxis” and the European Academy of Allergy and
Clinical Immunology/Global Allergy and Asthma European Network/European Dermatology Forum/World Allergy Organization urticaria guidelines,
respectively. None of the patients with CSU had concomitant IdA, and none of
the patients with IdA had CSU, thus excluding overlap in the patients analyzed
by using microarray analyses. We did not systematically assess autoimmune
comorbidities in the study subjects.

In our patients with CSU, the mean duration of disease was 5.0 years, and
the mean 7-day urticaria activity score (UAS7)° was 16.7. Fifty percent of patients with CSU had angioedema, and 26% had positive autologous serum skin
test reactions, which were defined as being greater than 2 mm compared with
those elicited by the negative control.

Blood was taken from all study subjects, and serum was separated after clot
formation without the use of a clotting enhancer. After separation, serum was
frozen immediately and stored at —80°C until used for microarray, ELISA, or
IgE purification for functional studies.

Ethics statement

Blood samples taken from patients and all material investigated in this
study were used after written informed consent, as approved by the ethics
committee of the Charité—Universitatsmedizin Berlin (EA1-329-14 and EA1I292-14), according to the Declaration of Helsinki (59th WMA General
Assembly, Seoul, Korea; October 2008).

Auto-IgEome analyses using a microarray

One milliliter of serum from 7 patients with CSU, 7 patients with IdA, and 7
healthy control subjects was incubated on a ProtoArray Human Protein
Microarray (version 5.1; Thermo Fisher, Waltham, Mass) at room temperature
for | hour. This microarray contains 9374 unique, full-length human proteins.
The slide was then washed 3 times with PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (TPBS;
Sigma, Munich, Germany) and incubated with 1 mL of staining solution for
30 minutes in the dark (1 ,g/mL each of mouse anti-human IgG—
phycoerythrin [clone G18-145] and mouse anti-human IgE-allophycocyanin
[clone MHE-18; both from BioLegend, San Diego, Calif]) in 2% human
albumin (clinical grade [Baxter, UnterschleiSheim, Germany] in TPBS).
Thereafter, the slide was washed extensively with TPBS, followed by 3 washes
with water and measurement at a resolution of 2 4m in a PowerScanner
(Tecan, Mannedorf, Switzerland). Specificity of mAbs was tested on nonserum-treated chips to remove off-target bindings. The signal was calculated
as mean or z scores, and signals corresponding to immunoglobulin-binding
proteins (TRIM domain-—containing or FcR proteins) were removed.

autoantigens (AAs) are those secreted by cells or that are membrane
bound. IgE-anti-IL-24 was detected in all patients with CSU but none of
the patients with IdA or healthy control subjects.

Quantification of IgE-anti-IL-24 function

The functionality of IgE-anti-IL-24 was tested by using histamine
release from peripheral CD34* stem cell-derived mast cells (PSCMCs),
which were prepared as previously described.'' Briefly, CD34* cells
(STEMCELL Technologies, Cologne, Germany) were cultured with rIL-3
and stem cell factor (both from Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) for 2 weeks in SFEM medium containing human LDL (STEMCELL
Technologies).

Beads for IgE purification were prepared with 1 mg of anti-IgE mab
(clone MB10-5C4; Miltenyi Biotec) conjugated to NHS-mag Sepharose
(GE, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) and blocked with 100 mmol/L
ethanolamine in 1 mol/L Tris (pH 8.0; Sigma). Total IgE was purified
from 1 L of pooled serum from patients with CSU or healthy subjects by
using these beads after 24 hours of incubation at 4°C. Beads were washed
with TPBS, and IgE was eluted with 0.1 mol/L citrate buffer (Sigma) at pH
2 and stabilized with 1 mol/L Tris (pH 8.0). PSCMCs were diluted to
2 X 10°/mL in 10 mL of SFEM medium (STEMCELL Technologies) containing 250 wL (= 10 wg) of total IgE preparation and incubated overnight
at 37°C.

Ninety-six-well plates were coated overnight at 37°C with 0.5 jg of IL-24
(Miltenyi Biotec) per well in carbonate buffer (pH 9). Plates were blocked for
2 hours at room temperature with 2% human serum albumin in PBS. IgEloaded PSCMCs were washed with RPMI (Thermo Fisher) and added to the
plates to a final concentration of 80,000 cells per well in 0.2 mL of SFEM
medium. In addition to the coated wells, further wells were submitted to antiIgE (1 g/well), 1% Triton-X, or nothing for 30 minutes at 37°C. Thereafter,
plates were centrifuged at 400g for 8 minutes to deplete cells. Supernatants

(Reflab, Copenhagen, Denmark).

IgE-anti-IL-24 measurements by means of ELISA

Sixteen micrograms of anti-IgE (MHE-18; BioLegend) were dispensed in
10 mL of Coating Buffer (0.1 mol/L carbonate [pH 9]; Sigma), and 25 pL of
this solution was used per well in a black NUNC Maxi-Sorb 384-well plate
(Thermo Fisher) to coat at 4°C overnight. After blocking with 2% human
serum albumin in TPBS again overnight at 4°C, human sera were added from a
96-well plate as four 25 jL/well replicates and incubated at 4°C
overnight, followed by 3 washes with TPBS and 3 washes with water.
Thereafter, 25 jsL/well antigen solution containing 4 wg of BHHCT (Sigma)
conjugated (molar ratio, 1:30) and europium (Sigma) saturated IL-24
(Miltenyi Biotec) per 10 mL of 50 pmol/L DTPA-purified BSA (PerkinElmer,
Waltham, Mass) in 50 mmol/L Tris buffer (pH 8) was added and incubated at
4°C for 1 hour. After washing 10 times with water, 25 wL of DELFIA enhancer
solution (PerkinElmer) was added to each well. Plates were measured in a
Victor V reader (PerkinElmer) with standard settings.

We report mean values of a total of 1062 patients with CSU and 482 healthy
control subjects, with each subject tested up to 4 times in 4 independent
experiments with similar results.

Calculation of IgE-anti-IL-24 units, fractions, and

cutoffs

Recombinant IgE-anti-green fluorescent protein (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Munich, Germany) was used to generate a standard curve to calculate
IgE-anti-IL-24 values in international units per milliliter of serum measured
by means of ELISA and IgE-anti-IL-24 values in international units per
protein spot by using a microarray. The sum of autoreactive IgE, as detected by
using the microarray, was calculated based on IgE-anti-IL-24 protein spots,
which allowed us to determine the percentage of IgE-anti-IL-24 of all
detectable autoreactive IgE. Because of several calculation steps, the values
can be viewed as an approximation. Total IgE levels measured by the Central
Laboratory of Charité—Universitatsmedizin Berlin were used to calculate the
percentage of ELISA-based IgE-anti-IL-24. The cutoff for increased
IgE-anti-IL-24 ELISA values was calculated according to the receiver
operating characteristic curve by using the Youden index.

 

 

Assessment of basophil numbers
Blood basophil numbers were determined by the Central Laboratory of the
Charité-Universitatsmedizin Berlin by using an automated hematocytometer.

Statistical analyses

Normal distribution was tested with the D’ Agostino-Pearson omnibus test,
and an approximately Gaussian distribution served as a basis to perform
Student t and ANOVA tests corrected for multiple testing by using the
Holm-Sidak method. The null hypothesis of random results was rejected if
the P value was very small (ie, P <.05).

RESULTS
Patients with CSU frequently exhibit IgE against
many autoantigens

All7 patients with CSU, patients with IdA, and healthy control
subjects exhibited IgE-AAbs against multiple autoantigens, as
assessed by using microarray analyses of serum reactivity to 9374
human proteins (Fig |). IgE-AAbs from patients with CSU
recognized a mean + SD of 95 + 66 autoantigens, patients
with IdA recognized a mean + SD of 105 + 63 autoallergens,
and healthy control subjects recognized a mean + SD of
28 + 11 autoallergens. The distribution of autoallergens
recognized by each group is shown in the Venn diagram (Fig 2
and Tables | and II ). Of the total 226 autoantigens recognized
by IgE (IgE-AAs) from at least 1 patient with CSU, only 4
were also recognized by IgE from a patient with IdA and none
by IgE from any healthy control subjects. IgE from patients
with CSU was more heterogeneous and recognized more different
autoantigens than IgE from patients with IdA (226 vs 161).

Considering the IgE-AAs recognized only by serum from a
patient with CSU, Tables | and II show that 222 autoallergens
were recognized by at least 1 patient. As the number of patients
increased, the number of common autoallergens decreased, so
that the IgE of half of the patients reacted to 77 autoantigens,
whereas 31 autoallergens were recognized by 71% of patients,
and only 3 autoallergens are fully shared autoallergens
recognized by all patients with CSU.

Accessibility of CSU-specific IgE-AAbs to
autoantigens expressed in the skin

Of the 31 autoantigens to which most (71%) of the patients with
CSU had IgE-AAbs, 8 were accessible, 4 were soluble, and 4 were
membrane-bound autoallergens. In contrast, the other 23
IgE-AAs were intracellular and therefore are unlikely to be
accessible. Of the 8 accessible IgE-AAs, all can be expressed in
the skin, but only 1, IL-24, was detected by IgE-AAbs of all 7
patients with CSU (Fig 1).

IgE-anti-IL-24 is the most abundant IgE-AAb in
patients with CSU

In all patients with CSU analyzed by using a protein array,
IgE-anti-IL-24 showed the highest serum levels of all IgE-AAbs
detected. Up to 1.1% (mean + SD, 0.6% + 0.24%) of the total
detectable IgE-AAbs in patients with CSU was IgE-anti-IL-24.
IgE-anti-IL-24 serum levels did not correlate with total IgE
(r = 0.002, P = .840) or total IgE-AAb levels. None of the 7
patients with CSU had detectable IgG-anti-IL-24 serum levels.

IgE-anti-IL-24 and IL-24 induce mast cell
degranulation

PSCMCs were sensitized with purified total IgE from patients
with CSU, healthy control subjects, or with purified IgE-anti-IL24. IL-24 induced degranulation in cells that had been
preincubated with purified IgE from patients with CSU but not
healthy control subjects (Fig 3, A). Mast cells also showed
degranulation after sensitization with purified IgE-anti-IL-24
and challenge with IL-24 (Fig 3, B).

IgE-anti-IL-24 is a sensitive and specific marker of
CSU

To further investigate the association of IgE-anti-IL-24 and
CSU, we developed and used an IgE-anti-IL-24-specific ELISA
to measure serum levels in patients with CSU and healthy control
subjects. In combined data from all tested patients with CSU
(n = 1062) and healthy control subjects (n = 482),
the mean + SD IgE-anti-IL-24 serum levels were 0.52 + 0.24
1U/mL (median, 0.49 IU/mL; range, 0.00-2.33 IU/mL)
and 0.27 + 0.08 IU/mL (median, 0.26 IU/mL; range, 0.10-0.61
IU/mL; P = .001), respectively (Fig 4). Eight hundred forty-seven
(80%) of 1062 patients with CSU exhibited higher than normal
IgE-anti-IL-24 serum levels compared with 99 (20%) of 482
healthy control subjects (P <.0001) based on the calculated cutoff
of 0.33 IU/mL. IgE-anti-IL-24 measurement showed acceptable
predictive properties for CSU, with a sensitivity of 80% (95%
CI, 76% to 83%), a specificity of 80% (95% CI, 75% to 84%),
and a likelihood ratio of 3.89 (Fig 4).

IgE-anti-IL-24 levels in patients with CSU correlate
with disease activity

Microarray-based IgE-anti-IL-24 levels correlated with
CSU activity, as assessed by using UAS7 (P = .03; Fig 5, A).
ELISA-based measurements also showed that relative IgE-anti—
IL-24 levels were linked to disease activity, although weakly
(Fig 5, B and C). Relative IgE-anti-IL-24 levels showed a
negative association with blood basophil counts (Fig 5, D).

DISCUSSION

This study shows that patients with CSU produce IgE against a
wide array of diverse autoantigens that are distinct from those in
patients with IdA and healthy control subjects. Further analyses
showed IL-24 to be a common, functional, and specific target of
IgE in patients with CSU. These findings support a role for IgE
directed to dermal autoantigens, of which IL-24 is the first to be
identified, in the pathogenesis of CSU.

This study has performed full-scale screening of IgE autoreactivity in patients with CSU using more than 9000 proteins.
Previous studies had identified only single IgE reactivities to self
(eg, IgE against thyroperoxidase or DNA) and did not use

5,12-19

screening assays for IgE. The present study shows that the
IgE of patients with CSU is directed to many more autoantigens
than that of healthy control subjects (226 vs 34 autoallergens).

Patients with CSU also exhibit IgE reactivity to a larger set of
different autoallergens than patients with IdA, who show similar
levels of total IgE as patients with CSU. This supports the
conclusion that the IgE reactivities detected are specific rather
than artifacts caused by increased total IgE levels. An important
question that needs to be addressed by future studies is whether
each autoallergen in patients with CSU is detected by one specific
IgE or whether there are some IgEs that recognize several
autoallergens. Because we cannot answer this question at present,
we have assumed in our calculation of IgE-anti-IL-24 levels that
all recognized autoallergens are bound by a monospecific IgE.
However, because it is possible that IgE-anti-IL-24 is
multivalent, in which case only a fraction will be bound to
IL-24 in the microarray, this would cause an underestimation of
the international units per milliliter level of our IgE-anti-IL-24
results. One thing that is very clear from the Venn diagram (Fig 2)
is that the majority of IgEs of patients with CSU, patients with
IdA, and healthy control subjects bind to different,
group-specific autoallergens. We have explored further only the
IgE-AAbs in sera from patients with CSU.

For an IgE-AA to be involved in the pathogenesis of CSU, it
would need to both be present in the skin and accessible to mast
cell-bound IgE. Eight of 226 IgE-AAs from patients with CSU
fulfill these criteria and are therefore likely candidates for causing
IgE-dependent skin mast cell activation in patients with CSU. Of
these, IL-24 is of prime interest for 3 reasons: (1) IgE against
IL-24 is present in the sera of most patients with CSU; (2) IL-24 is
present in a soluble form in the skin’; and (3) IgE-anti-IL-24 had
the highest serum levels of all IgE-AAbs detected, with about 1%
of the total IgE in patients with CSU directed to this cytokine.
This 1% level suggests clinical relevance because it is higher
than the clinically relevant 0.2% of IgE to B-lactam antibiotics”!
and similar to 1.4% for Cor a 14 and 3.2% for Ara h 2” in patients
with allergies to these allergens.

A further requisite for IgE-anti-IL-24 to be involved in the
pathogenesis of CSU would be its ability to activate mast cells to
release histamine. This was confirmed by loading cultured human
mast cells with IgE derived from the serum of patients with CSU,

FIG 5. Higher IgE-anti-IL-24 serum levels are associated with higher disease activity and lower basophil
counts. A, Higher IgE-anti-IL-24 values are linked to higher levels of disease activity, as assessed by using
the UAS7 in 5 of the 7 patients with CSU tested by using a microarray (for 2 patients with CSU, no UAS7
score was available). B, Higher levels of relative (to total IgE) IgE-anti-IL-24 tested by means of ELISA are
linked to higher disease activity, as assessed by using the UAS7, which reflects disease activity during
the 7 days before drawing blood (n = 52, averaged by pruning from n = 580 [ie, each data point shown
was averaged from 15 original data points for visualization purposes]). C, Higher relative IgE-anti-IL-24
levels, as determined by means of ELISA, are linked to higher CSU disease activity on the day the blood
was drawn, as assessed by using the UAS. D, Higher relative IgE-anti-IL-24 levels are associated with lower
blood basophil counts. Linear (Fig 5, A-C) and sigmoidal (Fig 5, D) regression lines are shown with 95% Cls

as dotted lines.

Presently, we do not know and can only speculate whether
the biological effects of IL-24, other than being a target of
IgE, are relevant in the pathogenesis of CSU. IL-24, an IL-10
family cytokine,” has been linked to inflammation™*° and
described to be upregulated in patients with several autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.°°7*
In mouse models of psoriasis, IL-24 is induced by TNF in keratinocytes, and inflammation is dependent on this IL-24 induction"? Unlike IL-10, IL-24 is not immunosuppressive but
leads to a broad stimulation of various immune cells and
functions.*°"!

In contrast to previous studies, our microarray screen did not
identify thyroid peroxidase (TPO) as a common IgE-AA.”'!?**
The reasons for this are currently unclear but might include
differences in the glycosylation, folding, or other features of the
TPO used or quenching of the IgE-anti-TPO signal in our assay
by the presence of IgG-anti-TPO, or it might be that IgE-antiTPO has a higher affinity to other autoantigens and therefore
binds to a different spot on our microarray.

Sir Bradford Hill’s 6th criterion for causality states that
demonstration of a biological gradient can be associated with

increased symptoms.’ Our finding that IgE-anti-IL-24 levels in
patients with CSU, as assessed by using either a microarray or
ELISA, are linked to disease activity supports this criterion.

The negative association with blood basophil counts might be
the consequence of basophil activation by IgE-anti—IL-24 in the
blood.'°**

The strength of this study is that it shows a marked increase in
IgE-anti-IL-24 values in patients with CSU compared with
healthy donors. We used a comprehensive array of autoantigens,
included IgE-matched control samples and normal donors to rule
out effects that are based on higher total IgE levels and confirmed
our microarray results in large populations of patients and healthy
control subjects by means of ELISA. A further strength of this
study is that it provides ex vivo evidence for the bioactivity of autoreactive IgE and associations with disease activity, both of
which suggest pathophysiologic relevance.

A weakness of the study is that we also identified IgEanti-IL-24 in some healthy donors, although at markedly lower
concentrations. Other studies have shown that expression of a
major anti-FeeRI antibody clone can also be found in healthy
donors but does not correlate with any clinical finding.'***

A further important weakness of this study is that we cannot yet
clarify whether IL-24 is the most specific and relevant
autoallergen in patients with CSU because we screened only a
fraction of the human proteome, with only the major protein
variants of each protein included. Also, we calculated
the concentration of IgE-anti-IL-24 based on recombinant IgEanti—green fluorescent protein, which might have a much stronger
affinity. If IgE binding to IL-24 is only one hallmark of autoreactive IgE and is bound also to other autoallergens on the array, the
IgE-anti-IL-24 concentration might be largely underestimated.
In conclusion, IL-24 has been identified as a common, specific,
and functional autoantigen of IgE antibodies in patients with
CSU. Higher IgE-anti-I[L-24 values were associated with higher
disease activity. This demonstration of autoreactive IgE in
patients with CSU might explain, at least in part, the clinical
success of treatment of the disease with the anti-IgE agent
omalizumab. New assays for measuring autoreactive IgE,
including IgE-anti-IL-24, might help in the clinical management
and monitoring of treatment responses in patients with CSU.

We thank the Mast Cell-driven Diseases and their Differential Diagnoses
(MAD*) team of the Dermatological Allergy (DEAL) group at Charité for help
and support and Professor Margitta Worm for providing sera of patients with
IdA.
