Background: Laboratory diagnosis of anisakidosis is based on specific serum IgE detection. Recently,
detection of allergen-induced basophil activation by flow cytometry has been proposed as a valuable tool
for allergy diagnosis.

Objective: To evaluate if detection of Anisakis-induced basophil activation by flow cytometry is a useful tool in the diagnosis of Anisakis allergy.

Methods: Patients with Anisakis allergy (A.s.*, n = 37), patients reporting chronic urticaria or
abdominal pain unrelated to fish ingestion (A.s.-, 1 = 51), and healthy controls (7 = 12) were studied.
Specific IgE to Anisakis simplex (A. simplex) was quantified with CAP-FEIA method, and basophil activation test was performed with three different concentrations of an Anisakis crude extract. Basophil gating
was performed with CD123 and HLA-DR, and cellular activation was measured with CD63.

Results: A.s.* patients showed significantly higher age and total IgE levels than did the A.s. patients.
Specific IgE to A. simplex correlated with the activated basophil percentages obtained with 15 g/mL
(r = 0.80; P < 0.001), 1.5 pg/mL (r = 0.84; P < 0.001), and 0.15 wg/mL (r = 0.82; P < 0.001) of A.
simplex crude extract. Nine individuals (3 in the A.s.* group and 6 in the A.s.- group) were nonresponders to basophil stimulation with anti-IgE. Five A.s.- patients showed positive IgE values to A. simplex
while the basophil activation test was negative.

According to the receiver operating characteristics curves performed between A.s.~ vs. A.s. and A.s.* vs.
healthy controls, the cutoff for a positive basophil activation test was >21% (specificity = 96%, sensitivity =
100%), and 16% (sensitivity and specificity of 100%) respectively. When nonresponders were included in the
A.s.* vs. A.s.~ analysis, sensitivity decreased to 95%. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that the specific
basophil activation was a factor independently associated with clinical symptoms of A. simplex allergy.

Conclusions: Detection of A. simplex-induced basophil activation by flow cytometry is a useful laboratory
technique for the diagnosis of anisakidosis, supplementing specific IgE determinations. © 2005 International

Anisakis simplex (A. simplex) is a fish parasite responsible for human infection (anisakidosis) and is able to induce
IgE-mediated reactions with several clinical manifestations
ranging from urticaria or angioedema to anaphylaxis (1-3).
The involvement of an IgE-mediated response to A. simplex
has been proven by skin prick test, serum specific IgE detection, and histamine release in whole blood (1-9). The two
most frequently used methods in Anisakis allergy diagnosis
are the skin prick test and the detection of specific IgE using
whole antigen from the parasite. Unfortunately, these diagnostic tools are interfered with cross-reactivities with other
nematodes and micro organisms (10-15).

Over the last years, the identification of allergeninduced basophil activation by flow cytometry has been
assessed as a new approach to the allergy diagnosis (16).

The method is based on the detection of a changed phenotype on activated basophils. When basophils are incubated with allergens, the specific allergen is recognized by
surface receptor FceR-bound IgE. As a consequence, the
activated basophil secretes bioactive mediators and up-regulates membrane expression of certain markers. The most
commonly used marker in basophil activation tests is CD63,
a granule protein that is expressed on the basophil plasmatic

membrane following activation, and its expression has been
shown to correlate with histamine release (17,18).

The aim of this study is to assess the usefulness of
flow cytometry to analyze in vitro allergen induced activation of basophils in A. simplex allergy. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was performed,
and factors independently associated with clinical history of Anisakis-induced allergy were identified.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects

Eighty-eight consecutive patients (28 male/60 female;
median age 34, IQR = 28-48) referred to the department of immunology to assess if A. simplex was involved
as a causing agent of their symptoms (urticaria being the
most frequently reported) were included in the study.
A. simplex allergy was considered when the following
criteria were met: compatible clinical history, A. simplex
positive specific IgE values, and negative for specific IgE
against fish. Thirty-seven patients had a clinical history
of A. simplex allergy (A.s.*), reporting several episodes
of severe abdominal pain, vomiting and/or acute urticaria-angioedema within 12 h of eating undercooked or
raw fish. A. simplex allergy was confirmed by detecting
specific IgE, and these patients were considered as sensitized to the parasite. The remaining 51 patients reported
chronic urticaria or abdominal pain unrelated to fish
ingestion (A.s._). A. simplex-specific IgE was found in
five of these patients. Twenty-four of the total 88
patients reported symptoms suggestive of hypersensitivity to other allergens, that were confirmed by detecting
serum specific IgE (grass pollen, 7 = 10; grass pollen
and mite, n = 1; mite, nm = 3; peanut, nm = 3; wheat,
n = 1; shrimp, n = 5; shrimp and grass pollen, n = 1).
Fish allergy was excluded, analyzing specific IgE in all
these patients. Twelve healthy controls with no previous
history of allergy and negative for specific IgE to A. simplex were included in the study. Basophil activation with
A. simplex crude extract was assessed in all patients and
controls by flow cytometry.

Preparation of Anisakis Crude Extract

Larvae were manually extracted from the muscle tissue of Merluccius merluccius obtained from local markets, as previously described (19). One gram of larvae
was mixed with 10 mL of PBS and ground in a mortar.
The mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000g, and
the pellet was discarded. The protein content of the
supernatant was 2 mg/mL, as measured by the method
of Bradford (20) with BSA as a standard. The crude
extract of the parasite was characterized by immunoblotting as previously described (19). Pooled sera (n = 3) of
A.s.* patients indicated the presence of several parasite
allergens, and no protein was recognized in the pooled
sera of healthy controls.

Quantification of Total and Specific IgE

Serum specific IgE determinations were performed
by UniCAP (Pharmacia-Upjohn, Uppsala, Sweden)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The detection range was 0.35-100 KUA/L. Values greater than
0.35 kKUA/L were considered positive. Total IgE was
quantified with an enzyme immunoassay (Access Total
IgE, Beckman Coulter, USA). The detection range was
0.25-3,000 IU/mL.

Basophil Activation Test

Heparinized blood was drawn and basophil activation
test was performed within 3 h of venipuncture. 100 pL
of sample was incubated for 15 min at 37°C with 20 pL
stimulation buffer containing IL-3 (60 ng/mL, Pharmingen/BD Biosciences, Erembodegem, Belgium) and A. simplex crude extract (15, 1.5, 0.15 g/mL final concentrations). Negative and positive controls were included by
incubating the blood without allergen and 10 wL anti-IgE
(0 pg/mL, Pharmingen), respectively. Basophil activation was stopped by adding 10 wL of EDTA (20 mM;
Sigma-Aldrich, Madrid, Spain) at room temperature for
5 min.

To analyze basophil activation, cells were stained with
20 pL CD63dgG1)FITC/CD1230gG1)-PE/HLA-DRUgG2a)PerCP reagent mixture (BD Biosciences) for 20 min in
the dark on ice. Then, samples were incubated with
2 mL FACS Lysing solution (BD Biosciences) for 15 min
at room temperature. After centrifugation (300 g, 5 min)
and washing with PBS, cells were resuspended with
300 wL of 1% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) and acquired in
a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).

To analyze the percentage of allergen-activated cells,
the basophil population was gated using side scattering
(SSC) and CD123 to eliminate most of the debris and
select CD123* cells. At least 500 CD123* cells were analyzed. Then, cells gated were displayed in a CD123/HLADR dot plot to eliminate HLA-DR™ cells. Subsequently,
CD63 expression was detected in the CD123* HLA-DR™
basophils. In the CD63/CD123 dot plots the quadrants
were set with the negative control of the test so as to
identify the activated basophils by high CD63 expression
@rd-4th decades; Fig. 1). Percentage of activated basophils was calculated by subtracting spontaneous CD63
expression (negative control) from the data obtained
with Anisakis stimulation.

Endotoxin is known to enhance IgE-mediated basophil
degranulation (21). To exclude potential contamination
of the parasite crude extract by endotoxin, basophil activation test was performed by incubating blood samples
(8 healthy controls) with 10 jL suboptimal concentration of anti-IgE (1 pg/mL) with or without 15 pg/mL of
parasite crude extract.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 10.0 software (Chicago, IL). Shapiro-Wilks test was performed to
analyze normality of parameters. Median (range) deDETECTION OF ANISAKIS SIMPLEX-INDUCED BASOPHIL ACTIVATION BY FLOW CYTOMETRY 33

scribed continuous variables. Qualitative variables were
compared with 7? test. Intergroup comparisons of continuous variables were performed with the Mann-Whitney U test and bivariate correlation was analyzed with
the Spearman’s rank test. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was performed to calculate the
optimal cutoff value of activated basophils, corresponding to the greatest sum for specificity and sensitivity values. Univariate analysis was performed to evaluate risk
factors associated with Anisakis allergy. Variables tested
were sex, age >35 years, total IgE >200 IU/mL, detection of specific IgE to A. simplex and detection of specific IgE to other allergens, and basophil activation with
Anisakis crude extract.

A stepwise multivariate logistic analysis (forward:
Wald) was performed to evaluate independent predictors
for Anisakis allergy. Explanatory variables were: sex,
age, specific IgE to A. simplex, specific IgE to other allergens, and basophil activation with Anisakis crude
extract. Variables with no significance at the 0.1 level
were removed from the final model.

RESULTS

tool in the detection of basophil activation using CD63/

scattering (SSC), CD123*, and HLA-DR” cells. Gating strategy and positive and negative representative results are
shown in Figure 1.

To analyze whether the parasite crude extract was
potentially contaminated by endotoxin, we compared
basophil activation induced by anti-IgE alone with that
induced by both anti-gE and the parasite crude
extract. No significant differences (P = 0.95) in the
percentage of activated basophils were found between
anti-IgE (32%, 10-86%) and anti-IgE plus the crude
extract (30%, 10-81%) stimulation. Thus, we conclude
that there is no synergistic effect of the crude extract
on basophil activation because of the presence of
endotoxin.

Table 1 shows the comparison of demographic and laboratory data between A.s.* and A.s.~ patients. The A.s.*
group showed significantly higher age and total IgE levels
than did the A.s.~ group. No differences were found in sex
and frequency of positive specific IgE to allergens other than
A. simplex between both groups. Positive and negative controls in the basophil activation test showed no differences
between both groups. Nine individuals (3 in the A.s.~ group
and 6 in the A.s.~ group) were nonresponders to basophil
stimulation with anti-IgE. Of note, two subjects showed high
percentage of activated basophils (49 and 82%) in the negative control. Total IgE correlated with specific IgE to

IgE to A. simplex and negative basophil activation. Two of
them showed low values of Anisakis specific IgE (0.46 and
0.62 kUA/L), whereas the remaining three had high Anisakis specific IgE levels (2.42, 3.91, and 81.5 kUA/L). These
three patients were parasitized by A. lumbricoides (as determined by parasitologic exam) and had elevated levels of A.
lumbricoides-specific IgE (4.88, 16.8, and >100 kKUA/L).

ROC curve analysis was performed between A.s.* and
A.s.- groups to calculate the optimal threshold value of
activated basophils with the addition of A. simplex crude
extract.

The areas under the curve for 15, 1.5, and 0.15 pg/
mL of crude extract were 0.96 (95% confidence interval
[CI]: 0.92-0.99; P < 0.001), 0.99 (95% CI: 0.99-1.00;
P < 0.001) and 0.97 (5% CI: 0.94-1.00; P < 0.001),
respectively. Threshold values of activated basophils providing the maximal specificity and sensitivity were the
following: 33% for 15 wg/mL (sensitivity = 97%, specificity = 78%), 21% for 1.5 wg/mL (sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 96%), and 8% for 0.15 g/mL (sensitivity =
91%, specificity = 89%). When nonresponders were
included in the analysis, the following sensitivity and
specificity values were obtained: 92 and 80% for
15 pg/mL, 95 and 96% for 1.5 wg/mL, and 86 and 90%
for 0.15 g/mL. According to this data, the best percentage of activated basophils discriminating A.s.* and A.s.~
patients was 21% when 1.5 g/mL crude extract is used
(Fig. 2). ROC analysis between A.s.* patients and healthy
controls yielded a cutoff of 16% activated basophils
(1.5 wg/mL crude extract) with a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. The sensitivity was reduced to 97% when
nonresponders were included in the analysis.

Univariate analysis was performed to analyze factors
associated with A. simplex allergy. Variables were sex,
age >35 years, total IgE >200 IU/mL, specific IgE to

A, simplex >0.35 KUA/L, positive specific IgE to other
allergens, and positive basophil activation. Only specific
IgE to A. simplex (relative risk [RR] 10.2, 95% CL 4.423.4; P < 0.001) and basophil activation (RR 22.5, 95%
Cl: 5.8-87.2; P < 0.001) were found to be associated
with clinical anisakidosis.

Multivariate analysis to search for factors independently associated with A. simplex allergy were performed
using as covariates sex, age, total IgE values, detection of
specific IgE to allergens other than A. simplex, Anisakisspecific IgE levels, and activated basophil values. Only
basophil activation was shown to be independently associated (adjusted OR 1.3, 95% CI: 1.02-1.66; P = 0.031)
with Anisakis allergy.

DISCUSSION

Flow cytometric analysis of allergen-induced basophil
activation has been reported for allergies to pollen (2225), latex (26,27), house dust mite (22,24), drugs (2831) and venoms (17,32), and it has been proven helpful
for diagnosis of allergy. This work shows that flow cytometric analysis of CD63 up-regulation in A. simplex-activated basophils is a useful approach for anisakidosis diagnosis. Monoclonal antibodies chosen for basophil identification by flow cytometry were CD123 (L3 receptor
a-chain) and HLA-DR. This approach is based on a previous report (33) describing a method for identifying
dendritic cells. Among peripheral blood mononuclear
cells with low SSC, high expression of CD123, and negative for HLA-DR, the authors observed (besides dendritic
cells) a population that was identified as basophilic granulocytes. Later, this finding was applied to the analysis
of basophil activation by flow cytometry (34-36).

We performed the study with samples from consecutive patients referred to our department to evaluate this
assay in a regular daily practice. Correlation analysis
showed a low association between total IgE and the percentage of activated basophils that could be accounted
by the correlation observed between total and specific
IgE. Furthermore, we found a positive correlation
between specific IgE and the percentage of activated
basophils and this association has also been reported in
wasp venom allergy (37), although this relationship is

not a general finding (27). A sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 96% were obtained when the cutoff is set at
21% of activated basophils according to the ROC curve
analysis performed between A.s.* and A.s.~_ patients.
The basophil activation test discriminated the A.s.~ and
healthy controls with 100% sensitivity and specificity.
Three of the 37 allergic patients were nonresponders
(no activation with anti-IgE). In these cases the test provided no information on their sensitization; however, for
study purposes, they were considered as false negative
results. Therefore, their inclusion reduced the sensitivity
of the test to 95%. The high sensitivity and specificity
found with A. simplex, similar to those reported with
other allergens (23-27), support this technique as a useful tool for anisakidosis diagnosis.

Elevated Anisakis-specific IgE was found in three
A.s.- who showed negative basophil activation with
A, simplex crude extract. This could be explained by
nonspecific adsorption due to high total serum IgE values or by cross-reactivity between A. simplex and other
organisms (10-15). Both mechanisms can be involved in
these false positive cases because their sera contained
A. lumbricoides-specific IgE and two of them showed
total serum IgE >3,000 IU/mL. Up to 50% of false positive CAP results have been reported when studying sera
from Anisakis-free patients but having several parasite
infections (15). Moreover, antigenic relationship between
A. simplex and ascaridoids has been reported (10,38,39)
and, therefore cross-reactivity can account for the
Anisakis-specific IgE found in these three A.s. patients.

Data supporting the usefulness of this technique in
the evaluation of the clinical relevance of the serum specific IgE were obtained from the multivariate analysis.
Basophil activation results were found to be independently associated with the presence of anisakidosis symptoms. This finding indicates that the basophil activation
technique mimics the in vivo mechanisms that are at the
cause of the clinical symptoms. On the other hand, the
multivariate analysis did not identify any association
between positive specific IgE and the presence of clinical symptoms. The usefulness of basophil activation test
to assess the clinical relevance of positive IgE values has

also been proposed for latex-induced allergy (27) and
pollen-associated food allergy (40). The aim of priming
with IL-3 is to increase sensitivity of the assay by enhancing the CD63 up-regulation by allergen (22). This would
be of interest when the allergenic stimulus is weak; however, IL-3 also increases nonspecific basophil activation,
thus decreasing specificity (22). This might explain our
findings of the two cases showing basophil activation
while no symptoms of Anisakis allergy were present.
These two samples showed a negative result when challenged with a lower concentration of crude extract. Furthermore, we have also found two samples with high
basal activation and we consider that priming with IL-3
may be at the basis of this finding. Unfortunately, we
were unable to reevaluate these cases and to perform
the assay without IL-3. Conversely, a previous report has
shown no CD63 up-regulation by IL-3 in purified basophils (41). Taking these data into account, we consider
that more information about effects of IL-3 in basophil
activation needs to be collected.

In conclusion, detection of A. simplex-induced basophil activation by flow cytometry is a useful laboratory
technique for the diagnosis of anisakidosis. The technique provides additional information when clinical relevance of a positive specific IgE result is unclear.
