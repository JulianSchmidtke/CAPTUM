Abstract

Background There are few data regarding epidemiology and clinical features of urticarial
diseases in the elderly population.

Objective The aim of the study was to determine the clinical and laboratory characteristics
of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) in the geriatric population.

Methods Electronic medical records of outpatient allergy consultations due to a diagnosis
of CIU were retrospectively reviewed to collect demographic data, urticaria activity score,
results of autologous serum skin test (ASST), and laboratory workup.

Results From 1598 patients with chronic urticaria, there were 1319 (82.5%) adult (adult
CIU group) and 124 (9.4%) elderly subjects (elderly CIU group). The elderly CIU group
was characterized by lower prevalence (46.7%) of women compared to the adult CIU
group (69.2%; P = 0.022); fewer wheals (1.4 + 0.5) vs. (2.3 + 0.7; P < 0.001); lower rates
of concomitant symptomatic dermographism 2 (2.2%) vs. 121 (12.6%; P = 0.003); and
lower rates of angioedema, 3 (14.1%) vs. 362 (37.8%; P < 0.001). Fewer elderly patients
with CIU (18.1%) than adult patients with CIU (44.7%; P = 0.019) demonstrated a positive
ASST. There were no differences in laboratory data between the study groups.
Conclusion CIU in the elderly population is nearly equally distributed in both sexes and is
characterized by fewer wheals, lower rates of concomitant symptomatic dermographism,
lower rates of angioedema, and lower ASST positivity.

Introduction

Urticaria is widely regarded as a heterogeneous group of
diseases that share a distinct skin reaction pattern, i.e.,
the development of urticarial skin lesions." Chronic idiopathic (spontaneous) urticaria (CIU) is defined as wheals
and/or angioedema arising spontaneously, and the disease
lasts >6 weeks." The prevalence of CIU is mostly
unknown, but it is estimated that about 0.1-0.8% of the
total population suffers from chronic urticaria at any
single time.* +

Most of the literature on urticaria deals with urticaria in
adults, but the population is getting older, with a greater
percentage of the population in the over-65 age group, and
it will become increasingly important to investigate specific
features of diseases present in geriatric dermatology. In
elderly individuals, there is a 20% reduction in dermal
thickness, the dermal layer loses up to 50% of the mast
cells, and basal and cutaneous blood flow are decreased by
approximately 60%.* Therefore, it would be interesting to
compare clinical and laboratory features of adult CIU with
CIU of the elderly.

Published data on urticarial diseases in the elderly population are not only relatively hard to come by but are
also less informative. This is due to the frequently uncertain distinction drawn between several forms of urticaria,
paucity of confirmatory challenge test results for the physical urticarias and supposed drug-induced urticaria, and
fundamental differences in databases (e.g., primary care,
general hospital-based, or national urticaria referral center
services), leading to different patient selections.

Therefore, there are few data regarding epidemiology
of urticarial elderly population.°”
Although CIU is the most common subtype of all forms
of nonacute urticaria in the general population, its prevalence and clinical characteristics in the geriatric popula
diseases in the

tion are largely unidentified. The purpose of the present
study was to determine clinical and laboratory characteristics of CIU in an outpatient geriatric population.

Patients and methods

The study was performed at our allergy and clinical immunology
secondary and tertiary care referral centers in Lakhish district of

Clinical trial Chronic urticaria in the elderly

southern Israel. We retrospectively reviewed the electronic
medical records of all outpatient allergy consultations due to a
diagnosis of CIU from January 1, 2002, to October 31, 2010.
CIU was defined as wheals and/or angioedema arising
spontaneously, when the disease lasts > 6 weeks.

In the study, we included all subjects > 18 years with CIU,
while patients < 18 years and those with all other forms of
urticaria were excluded.

As part of the standard practice in our allergy clinic, all
subjects had been informed about any risks involved with
testing and written informed consent for allergologic work-up
(skin prick test, autologous serum skin test [ASST]) had been
obtained. As the above-mentioned laboratory workup and ASST
are part of routine diagnostic practice in our clinic, further
ethical approval was not required.

The following data were collected:

1 Demographic data, urticaria activity score (UAS).

2 Results of ASST, if done.

3 Laboratory workup results: complete blood count, highsensitivity C-reactive protein, thyroid function tests, C3, C4, and
IgE.

Clinical evaluation of chronic urticaria

Clinical and laboratory evaluation and classification of chronic
urticaria were performed according to the joint initiative of the
Dermatology Section of the European Academy of Allergology and
Clinical Immunology (EAACI), EU-funded network of excellence,
Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GALEN),
European Dermatology Forum (EDF), and World Allergy
Organization (WAO) EAACI/GA®)LEN/EDF/WAO guidelines.®

Cold urticaria was excluded to patients who had a history of
wheals and/or angioedema following cold exposure by
application of an ice cube to the skin of the forearm for
20 minutes and checking for wheal appearance within
15 minutes at the test site. Cholinergic urticaria was excluded
after emergence of pruritic erythematous wheals within 5—

15 minutes of a hot shower.

Dermographism was assessed in all patients using firm
stroking of the skin by a dermographometer with a pressure of
4900 g/cm? and induction of linear itchy wheals within several
minutes.

Solar urticaria was confirmed by exposure to natural sunlight.

Screening for food allergy was investigated by means of
medical history, skin tests to food allergens (ALK-Abello Co.,
Hoersholm, Denmark), and an elimination diet for three weeks.
Skin prick test was performed with a panel of 24 commonly
consumed foods in Israel (using ALK-Abello allergens) — cow’s
milk, egg white, peanut, soybean, hazelnut, almond, sesame,
pecan nut, mixed fish, tuna, mixed shellfish, celery, wheat,
tomato, beef, chicken, potato, orange, pea, mushroom, apple,
peach, mango, and kiwi. Latex allergy (type | hypersensitivity to
latex proteins) was excluded by skin prick test with latex (ALKAbello Co.).

When drug allergy was suspected, the drug was withheld for
two weeks and then replaced with a chemically unrelated
medication. In all patients with CIU, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (including aspirin and salicylate-containing
drugs), and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were
constantly discontinued.

ASST was performed with 50 uL of the patient's undiluted
serum after allowing blood to clot at room temperature for
30 minutes and sample blood centrifugation at 500 g for
10 minutes, which was then injected intradermally into the volar
aspect of the forearm together with simultaneously injected
controls, including saline and 10 j1g/mL histamine. The mean
diameters of the wheals were measured at 30 minutes. The test
was considered positive if the serum-injected site manifested a
wheal with a diameter at least 1.5 mm greater than that of the
saline.

Assessment of urticaria severity

A unified and simple scoring system, the UAS, according to the
EAACI/GA®LEN/EDF/WAO guidelines was used to assess CIU
clinical severity.2 The UAS is based on the assessment of key
urticaria symptoms (wheals and pruritus) — graded from 0
(none) to 3 (severe).° We routinely apply UAS at the first visit
and thereafter every eight weeks for the assessment of H;
antihistamine clinical efficacy. As urticaria symptoms frequently
change in intensity, we usually use in routine clinical practice
the UAS 7, mean of the sum of the UAS from the previous
seven days and fix it in the medical records.

Statistical analysis

Comparison of categorical variables between groups was
performed by chi-squared test and Fisher’s exact test (twotailed) as appropriate. Continuous variables are expressed as
mean + standard deviation and were compared between
groups by Student’s ttest (two-tailed). Pairwise group
comparisons with Bonferroni adjustment of significance level
were performed. Level of significance was P = 0.05 and with
Bonferroni adjustment P < 0.025. Statistical analyses were
performed using the software GraphPad PRISM version 4,
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).

Results

During the study period, we identified referrals due to
chronic urticaria of 1319 patients aged > 18 years.
Among them, there were 124 (9.4) patients older than
65 years.

All these subjects underwent the same allergologic
workup of chronic urticaria (skin prick test, autologous
serum skin test, and laboratory examination).

Summary of the identified causes of chronic urticaria in
the studied population is presented in Table 1. Physical
urticarias were found in 11 (8.9%) elderly and 227

(313; 2.4%), P < 0.001) subjects (Table 1).

Patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria

After excluding all identified causes of chronic urticaria,
92 elderly patients (aged 71.9 + 6.7 years) (elderly CIU)
and 959 adults (aged 42.9 + 24.3 years) were classified
as having CIU (adult CIU). A significantly higher prevalence (69.2%) of women was noted in the adult CIU
group than in the elderly CIU group (46.7%; P = 0.044)
(Table 2).

No differences in blood count and differential, serum
total IgE, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, or thyroid
stimulating hormone levels were observed between the
study groups (Table 2). ASST was performed in 61
(66.3%) elderly patients with CIU and 548 (57.2%) adult
patients with CIU. Fewer (11; 18.1%) elderly patients
with CIU than adult patients with CIU ([245; 44.7%];
P = 0.019) demonstrated a positive response against their
own serum in ASST (Table 2).

There were no differences in concomitant skin diseases
(atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, and psoriasis),
asthma, or allergic rhinitis between the adult and elderly

Clinical trial Chronic urticaria in the elderly

No differences between the study groups were observed
in urticarial wheal distribution on the skin surfaces. Nevertheless, as it is presented in Table 4, the elderly CIU
group was characterized by more pruritus
(2.0 + 0.8) and fewer wheals (1.4 + 0.5) than the adult
CIU group) (1.1 + 0.4; 2.3 + 0.73

All the patients included in this study were receiving
pharmacological treatment as recommended by the guidelines.° Regarding the type of antihistamines, all (100%)
patients were treated with non-sedating antihistamines as
the first-line therapy. However, eight (17.4%) subjects in
the elderly CIU group and 27 (2.8%) (P < 0.001) in the
adult CIU group required the addition of sedating antihistamines to control severe pruritus.

Two (4.1%) patients in the elderly CIU group and 31
(3.2%) in the adult CIU group (P = 0.67) needed to
employ systemic corticosteroids. There was no difference
between the study groups in the number of subjects who
were completely symptom free (without any treatment)
after 12 months (Table 4).

 

There was no difference in clinical or laboratory
parameters between female and male patients with elderly
CIU.

Discussion

In this study, we succeed to identify possible underlying
causes of chronic urticaria in 25.8% of a geriatric population that was in agreement with previous studies in the general population.*° ** Moreover, there was no difference in
the prevalence of CIU between geriatric and adult patients.
An important difference in elderly CIU was a lack of female
predominance, which was a characteristic feature of adult
CIU that is well recognized from previous studies.* #'**>
Nowadays, the natural course of CIU is largely unpredictable, but it is accepted that many patients with CIU

will suffer for more than one year or much longer.** ‘+
In our study, we did not observe any difference in proportion of elderly and adult patients with CIU who were
completely symptom free after 12 months. Although the
overall urticaria clinical severity measured using UAS was
similar in both groups, the elderly CIU group was characterized by higher pruritus scores and fewer wheals. Consequently, more sedating H, blockers were used in the
elderly CIU group to overcome severe pruritus. Itching is
a common condition in elderly patients and probably is
caused by a combination of factors, low humidity being
one of the most important’’; thus, we could not conclude
that severe itching is caused only by CIU in these subjects.
However, we think that the observed lower rates of
angioedema could be a feature of CIU in the elderly population. Actually, no single case of angioedema without
wheals was observed in the elderly CIU group. Though
the current guidelines include angioedema without wheals
as a part of CIU, some authors signify that angioedema
alone may be another disease.’

Our study revealed fewer wheals in the elderly CIU
group. Older age is associated with reduced histamine
skin reactivity.'® Mast cells have been ascribed an important role in the pathological mechanism of CIU and are
present in increased numbers in the skin of adult patients
with CIU.'7 In a recent experimental study, mast cells
were critically involved in serum-mediated vascular leakage in CIU through an IgE- and IgG-independent mechanism, which was prevented by H, antihistamines.'* We
can only speculate that fewer wheals in the elderly CIU
group might be associated with lower numbers of mast
cells in aged skin’ or with lower histamine release by
aged mast cells.

Furthermore, the elderly CIU group was characterized
by the lower occurrence of autoreactivity that can be
judged from the ASST results, while generally one-third
of patients with CIU demonstrate a positive response
against their own serum.**”*° ASST positivity correlates
with higher CIU severity, with a longer duration of disease*° *3 and a consumption of significantly more antihisASST
positivity in our elderly CIU group may be partly
explained by the aging associated immunosenescence.**

While a combination of CIU and other urticaria types
is not uncommon and is related to longer duration of the

taminic medications.** The observed lower

10,11

disease, our elderly CIU group was characterized by
lower prevalence of concomitant physical urticarias.

Our findings may have several potential implications for
the diagnosis and management of elderly patients with
CIU. We can speculate that among some elderly subjects
suffering from severe pruritus, CIU or dermatographic urticaria might be potentially underdiagnosed due to lower
incidence of urticarial wheals and/or dermatographism at

physical examination. We can also suggest that more
sedating H, blockers could be prescribed more liberally in
elderly patients with CIU to overcome severe pruritus and
to improve quality of life. In addition, the lower rate of
ASST positivity renders this test to be less informative and
consequently obsolete in the diagnostic workup of elderly
patients with CIU.

We understand that this study has several limitations,
mainly related to its retrospective nature. First, recording
bias is an important possible limitation. Second, heterogeneity of the patients’ characteristics, screening regimens,
combination of treatment, and outcome reporting precluded the pooling of results and limited interpretation.
Third, we did not investigate a possible role of agingassociated modifications of the immune system in the
pathophysiology of elderly patients with CIU.

In conclusion, CIU in the elderly population is nearly
equally distributed in both sexes and is characterized by
fewer wheals and angioedema, lower rates of concomitant
physical urticaria, and lower ASST positivity.
