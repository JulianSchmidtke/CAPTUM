ABSTRACT

Intradermal injection of autologous serum and plasma elicit a cutaneous reactivity in almost
45-60% of patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria (CIU). This reactivity is associated with
the presence of auto antibodies against IgE or IgE receptors. This study was carried out to
compare the cutaneous reactivity of autologous serum and plasma skin tests in a series of
patients with CIU for diagnosis of auto antibodies against IgE or IgE receptor.

Fifty eight patients with CIU were injected intradermally with autologous serum and plasma
(anticoagulated by citrate). Histamine was used as positive control and normal saline as
negative control. The study group was checked by routine laboratory tests (CBC, U/A etc),
allergens with skin prick tests, and serum IgE level, and auto antibodies against thyroid as well.
Duration of urticaria was another factor which was assessed.

There was no significant difference between positive ASST and positive APST patients for
the above mentioned tests. 77.6% of the patients were Positive for APST and 65.5% were
ASST positive. Duration of urticaria was longer in patients with positive ASST and APST than
ASST and APST negative patients, although the difference was not statistically significant.

Autologous serum skin test (ASST) and autologous plasma skin test (APST) could be used
for estimation of duration and severity of urticaria and planning for the treatment.

the daily or almost daily occurrence of wheals for at
least 6 weeks. The term Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria
(CIU) is used for definition of chronic urticaria cases in
which neither signs of vasculitis nor causative drugs,
foods, and/or physical factors could be specified. It has
been identified from previous studies that chronic
idiopathic urticaria (CIU) includes a heterogeneous

subset (up to 46% of cases)who have a previously
unidentified serum factor, which was discovered to
be an antibody with an important role in the
pathogenesis of CIU.' This antibody belongs to the IgG
isotype that reacts against the a-chain of the high
affinity IgE receptor (FceRIa) of basophiles and mast
cells, or alternatively against IgE itself.’ Functional
properties of these antibodies are evidenced in vivo by
the intradermal injection of autologous serum and
autologous plasma. This procedure induces a whealand-flare response in patients with CIU; further in vitro
evidence is the release of histamine from basophils and
mast cells elicited by addition serum of CIU patient on
these cells.**

Since it is hypothesized that CIU has an
autoimmune etiology, so CIU patients with positive
ASST and in vitro assays have been known as Chronic
Autoimmune Urticaria (CAIU). These patients
frequently present an increased incidence of
autoimmune disorders (e.g. thyroiditis) and more
severe clinical features of urticaria than patients
suffering from mild chronic urticaria.*

The literature includes several reports contributing
to better understanding the pathogenesis and effector
mechanisms of CIU, focusing on the different cellular
populations that infiltrate urticarial lesions. A
comprehensive review of the molecular
immunopathology of CIU indicates early activation of
mast cells, followed by a lymphocyte and granulocyte
cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction with a ThO (or,
alternatively, a combination of Thl/Th2- CD4)
cytokine profile.**

Kaplan et al.? mentioned that warming sera to 56° c
decreases sensitivity of ASST. It has been
demonstrated that C5a amplifies IgG-dependent
histamine release from basophils in chronic urticaria.'°
Asero et al mentioned that coagulation cascade might
be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic urticaria."
Thrombin is the last enzyme of the coagulation cascade
and is generated from prothrombin by activated factor
X in the presence of activated factor V and calcium
ions. Thrombin triggers mast cell degranulation and
may activate protease activated receptor.’ Some studies
showed that heparin inhibits both the skin response to
autologous serum and histamine release from human
cultured basophils in vitro.'*!° Importantly, heparin
exerted its inhibitory effect in vivo also in ASSTpositive patients whose sera did not induce any
histamine release in vitro.'' Metz and colleges '° had

confirmed their previous finding that plasmas from a
proportion of patients with CU, particularly those with
a more severe disease, showed signs of thrombin
generation as evidenced by the elevated levels of
fragment F,,,. However, whatever the mechanism of
coagulation activation (primary or secondary), the
presence of thrombin, an enzyme that increases
permeability of blood vessels, seems to play an
important role in the pathogenesis of CU. In
conclusion, the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation
cascade is activated in chronic urticaria and this
activation appears to lead to thrombin generation, and
thus suggesting the efficacy of heparin in treatment of
chronic urticaria. In fact, both heparin (which highly
increases the antithrombin activity in plasma) and oral
anticoagulant therapy (which reduces thrombin
generation in vivo) have been shown to be effective in
the treatment of chronic urticaria." Thus it is
predictable that APST generates more positive
responses than ASST because plasma _ contains
coagulation factors and complements. Therefore
consumption of coagulation factors and formation of
clot seems to be responsible for less positive results in
ASST.

This study was aimed to compare the sensitivity of
Autologous Serum Skin Test and Autologous Plasma
Skin test in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria for
coordination clinical pattern of disease and probable
presence of auto antibody against IgE or IgE Receptor
(FceRIa). The results could be used in predicting the
course and severity of urticaria and selecting the best
protocol for treatment of each patient.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Fifty eight patients (17 male, 41 female; with mean age
of 34 years) referred to asthma and allergy clinic
located in children medical center during 2000-2007
were diagnosed with chronic idiopathic urticaria
recruited for this test comparison study.

Detection of Antibody against IgE and IgE Receptor

Fifty eight patients referred to asthma and allergy
clinic recruited in this study. All the patients
voluntarily accepted to participate in the study and
signed the approval according to the Helsinki protocol.
SPSS 17 was used for the statistical analysis.

All subjects had disease duration of more than 6
weeks. The severity of urticaria was scored on a scale
from 0 to 4 as mentioned ( Table 1).

The severity of itching was scored as mentioned
(Table 2).'

Probable causes of urticaria were ruled out by
means of history, prick test and lab data (CBC, LFT,
UA, Stool Op&Ob, IgE, LFT, thyroid function tests,
ANA, RF, CH50, C3, C4). Lab data, prick test and
history were used also for detection of potential causes
of allergies to drugs, foods, inhalations and infections
and auto immune disease. All the patients underwent
skin prick test for 6 allergens including: mite
(Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farina) and cockroach for indoor allergens
and grass, trees, weeds for outdoor allergens.

In addition other prick tests were done individually
for food, additives and inhalation allergens according to
the history of the patients. Antihistamines and other

 

 

medications were discontinued one week before skin
testing in all cases. All the patients had an autologous
serum skin test (ASST), and autologous plasma skin
test (APST) as defined by Grattan, et al.'°

The exclusion criteria were: chronic disease and
malignant disease, pregnancy, hyper IgE syndrome
(IgE <500 IU and absence of criteria for hyper IgE
syndrome in history and physical exam and lab data),
allergic urticaria (IgE-mediated). However
accompanying diseases such as eczema and allergic
rhinitis ete were not excluded. Five age- and sexmatched healthy cases were recruited as controls.

The autologous plasma skin test (APST) was
compared with ASST to detect auto reactivity in
patients with CU.'°'*!’ If the difference between
positive and negative control was less than 3 mm or
negative control was more than 3 mm the case was
excluded and if the positive control was 3 mm more
than negative control, the patients were included.
Patients who had low titer ANA and RF without
symptoms were included while high titer of ANA and
RF or auto immune symptoms excluded the patients
from this study.

Two blood samples (2 ml each) were obtained in
sterile conditions. For the ASST, after separation of
serum, 0.05 ml of serum was injected intradermaly on
the volar surface of forearm. For the APST citrated
blood was centrifuged 1250 r/min for 3 minutes in
room temperature to separate the plasma. Immediately
after separation 0.05 ml of plasma was _ injected
intradermaly on the volar surface of the forearm. All
patients received intradermal 0.05 ml normal saline as
negative control and 10 mg/ml histamine skin prick test
as positive control simultaneously. Test was
considered positive if the wheal of ASST was at least 3
mm more than those of negative control with saline and
also if histamine wheal was at least 3 mm more than
the negative control.'°

RESULTS

The results were categorized follows:
Autologous serum skin test was positive in 38out of 58
patients (65.5%), while the autologous plasma skin test
was positive in 45 out of the 58 patients (77.6%). 37
patients were positive for both ASST and APST and 12
out of 58 patients were negative for both skin tests. One
of these 58 patients was negative for APST and
positive for APST, while 18 patients were APST
positive and ASST negative (Table 3, 4).

The results of positive skin prick test for allergens
are mentioned (Table 3).

Twenty five out of 45 patients with positive APST
were positive for an allergen prick test, while 8 out of
13 patients with negative APST were positive to an
allergen prick test. The results did not have significant
difference between APST negative and positive
patients (p=0.7). Twenty two out of 38 patients with
positive ASST were positive for an allergen prick test,
while 11 out of 20 patients with negative ASST were
positive for an allergen prick test. The results did not
have significant difference between ASST negative and
positive patients (p=0.832).

There was no significant specific result regarding to
the variation of allergens used for skin prick test,
therefore it was not mentioned.

as

Mean IgE value for the patients with positive ASST
was 115 IU and 350 IU for negative ASST group. The
mean value for positive APST patient was 122 IU and
434 IU for negative APST patients.

According to scale of urticaria! 5% of the patients
showed score 2 urticaria, 84.4% showed score 3 and
10.3% showed score 4 urticaria at the beginning of the
study. One month after the beginning of study and
doing the ASST and APST the patients reevaluated for
urticaria scale, the results were as follows:23 patients
(39.6% ) evaluated as score 0-1 ,9 patients (15.5% ) as
score 2 ,20 patients (34.4% ) as score 3 ,6 patients
(10.3% ) as score 4.

In the course of study and 1 month follow up
thereafter, the patients with positive APST
demonstrated a history of mean urticaria duration of 32
months. This duration was 26 months in negative
APST patients (p=0.646). Mean duration of urticaria in
positive and negative ASST were 38 and 20 months
respectively (p=0.353) in this study. Urticaria duration
did not differ between these four groups (Table 5).

Ten out of the total 58 patients showed an abnormal
thyroid function test or revealed anti thyroid antibody
(p=0.743),which include 7of ASST positive patients
(18%) and 3 of ASST negative patients. 10 of 45 APST
positive patients (22%) showed abnormal thyroid
function tests ,while none of the APST patients had
abnormal thyroid function tests test. There was not
significant difference between ASST positive patients
and ASST negative patients (Fisher’s exact test
p=0.097).

Nine out of 38 patients with positive ASST and 4 of
the negative ASST had a history of dermographism
(p=0.749) without interfering with skin prick test and
their negative control test revealed no wheal. This ratio
was 10 of the 35 positive APST patients and 3 of the 13
negative APST patients (p=0.948).

Three out of 58 patients were ANA or RF positive.
These patients were not excluded from the study
because of low titer ANA or RF. They did not have any
other criterion of collagen vascular disease but one
patient was excluded because of high titer ANA and RF
and symptoms of collagen vascular disease.

As Asero et al.'' and Greaves'* had reported in their
previous studies, APST is a reliable in vivo skin test,
but dos Santos et al, Asero et al, Fagolio et al and
Sichere et al reported the accuracy of the test to be 3053%,'*!°?! Caproni et al mentioned that ASST alone is
not sufficient to define CIU as an autoimmune disease.
However, ASST has often been chosen as an
experimental model’ because it has an effect very
similar to that of the physiological stimulus that
induces whealing in urticaria.*

The results of the current study seem to be similar
to the previous studies, which indicate that autologous
plasma skin test is a sensitive method for detection of
functional auto antibodies in patients with urticaria.'°
There is an agreement between ASST and APST in
positive or negative results. Since 84.4% of the cases
were positive or negative for both tests, 37of the 58
cases were positive and 12 were negative for both tests.
8 cases were positive for APST and negative for ASST.
Only one case proved to be positive for ASST and
negative for APST. Although the literature includes
various results, these variations depend on multiple
factors including: methods of skin test, interpretation
criteria of skin test results, type of anticoagulant,
centrifuging blood specimen and methods of serum
separation. For example Asero et al in 2007'° used the
EDTA as anticoagulant, so the positive results reported
to be 97% of the cases. He and his colleges repeated
another study in 2009,°° when they considered the
wheal as positive response while Pachlopnic and

Vol. 10, No. 2, June 2011

positive response. Consideration of flare or redness as
positive response was responsible for 52% prevalence
of positive response in urticaria patients and 55% in
healthy controls. The test result was considered positive
when the mean diameter of the wheal with autologous
serum was at least 2.5 mm larger than the mean
diameter of the wheal elicited by the negative control.”*

Impaired thyroid function and anti thyroid antibody
were detected in 10 cases. The correlation of the results
with positive APST seems to be considerable because
these cases were all APST positive, although the
relation was not significant. Reported results of ASST
in these cases were 7 patients ASST positive and 3
patients ASST negative. Realizing the fact that thyroid
auto antibodies are present at a relatively high
frequency in patients with positive APST Chronic
Idiopathic Urticaria (CIU).?!?°”*

A relation between IgE ratio and duration of
urticaria could not be proved in this study. IgE ratio
and allergen sensitivity do not play a significant role in
the duration of urticaria.””'*”’ It seems that in contrary
to some reports, in this study existence of allergen
sensitivity showed no relation to the false positive or
negative result. Surprisingly the patients who suffered a
long term urticaria had a lower IgE ratio than the
patients with short duration of the disease. The possible
explanation indicates that allergen sensitivity in chronic
urticaria attains less important role and the cause of
urticaria is autoimmune antibodies against IgE and IgE
receptor.

IRANIAN JOURNAL OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA AND IMMUNOLOGY /115
V. Sajedi, et al.

There was no significant difference in the case of
relation between the duration of urticaria and positive
result of autologous plasma and serum skin tests.

Duration of CIU seemed to be longer in patients
with positive ASST and APST tests, but the difference
was not significant.

Another finding of this study was that after ASST
and APST, the patients experienced significant
improvement in their signs and symptoms .Either they
had been cleared and had not relapsed for 2-4 weeks or
experienced mild disease. Evaluation scoring of the
patients after 4 weeks follow up showed : 23 patients
(39.6% ) evaluated as score 0-1 ,9 patients (15.5%) as
score 2 ,20 patients (34.4%) as score 3 ,6 patients
(10.3% ) as score 4 , indicating improvement in the
score of the patients’ urticaria. In these circumstances
the need for drugs is minimized, indicating that ASST
and APST could be an effective therapy,’*” the
effect was more significant in patient with larger
wheals and flare size. Interestingly, ASST results were
found to have more coordination with clinical
symptoms of the patients, whereas positive APST does
not show coordination with clinical symptoms in spite
of more positive results comparing with ASST.

Although H1-antihistamines are the first line of
treatment in all urticaria cases, the first generation
antihistamine drugs were poorly tolerated in this study.
We could not prescribe diphenhydramine more than 25
mg/day due to low compliance of our patients while in
some studies the prescribed dose reported 100-200
mg/day.”

 

Suggestions

Considering the agreement of ASST and APST in
84% of the cases for negative or positive results, it is
suggested to check both tests simultaneously to confirm
the result of either test. Combination of ASST and
APST with an in vitro test such as expression of CD63
or CD203 could be a reliable diagnostic approach and a
strong predicting tool for determining the severity and
duration of CIU, and a valuable aid in planning the
treatment protocol as well.
