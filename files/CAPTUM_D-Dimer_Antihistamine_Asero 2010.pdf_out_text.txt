Abstract

Background: Chronic urticaria (CU) patients often present
activation of the coagulation cascade and fibrinolysis whose
markers correlate with disease severity. Aim: We evaluated
whether CU patients with elevated plasma D-dimer have a
poor response to antihistamines, and anticoagulation and
inhibition of fibrinolysis may be beneficial in these patients.
Methods: Sixty-eight consecutive patients with CU were
prescribed cetirizine 10 mg daily for 2 weeks; plasma D-dimer was measured. Non-responders were given cetirizine 30
mg daily for 1 week and subsequently, in case of failure, systemic steroids. Patients with persistent uncontrolled CU and
elevated D-dimer plasma levels were offered subcutaneous
nadroparin 11,400 IU once a day and oral tranexamic acid
1 g three times a day for 2 weeks. Results: D-dimer levels
were elevated in 14/68 (20.6%) patients (range 306-7,317 ng/
ml; normal values <278 ng/ml) and were associated with a
more severe disease. Twelve of 14 patients with elevated Ddimer levels did not respond to antihistamine treatment
(p = 0.0001). On the whole, 14 patients reported a poor or

absent response to cetirizine 10 mg daily and only 1 of these
responded satisfactorily to cetirizine 30 mg daily. Eight patients with elevated D-dimer and whose disease was not satisfactorily controlled by prednisone received nadroparin
and tranexamic acid. A marked improvement of symptoms
was observed in 5/8 cases. Conclusion: Our findings indicate
that CU patients with elevated D-dimer often present a more
severe disease with reduced response to antihistamines.
Based on this short pilot study, some of these patients may
benefit from treatment with nadroparin and tranexamic
acid. Copyright © 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel

Introduction

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a rather frequent disorder;
the recent guidelines of the British Society of Allergy and
Clinical Immunology have estimated its prevalence in
the general population at 0.5-1% [1]. The majority of patients with CU are easily controlled by antihistamines at
licensed doses; however, a subset of CU patients do not
respond to these drugs even if they are given at doses 2-4
times higher than the licensed ones, as suggested by the
European guidelines [2]. In these subjects, a reasonable

control of the disease can be obtained only by the use of
systemic steroids or ciclosporin.

Recent studies have provided evidence that CU is often characterized by the activation of the coagulation
cascade by the extrinsic pathway [3, 4], and that in some
cases this can be intense enough to lead to an elevation of
plasma levels of D-dimer [5]. There is also some evidence
that the activation of the coagulation cascade is associated with a more severe disease [4, 5]. In the present study
we assessed whether CU patients with elevated plasma
D-dimer levels are more likely to present a scarce response to antihistamines at licensed dose. Further, since
an elevated plasma level of D-dimer reflects both the activation of the coagulation cascade and an active firbinolysis, we studied whether a combined therapy based on
the association of an anticoagulant and a fibrinolysis inhibitor may prove helpful in patients with chronic urticaria showing a scarce response to conventional treatments. Antifibrinolytic agents have been shown to be an
effective treatment in idiopathic angioedema [7].

Patients and Methods

Patients

Sixty-eight consecutive patients with CU (M/F 16/52; mean

age 49 years, range 14-84), defined as the recurrence of itchy
wheals with or without angioedema for >6 weeks, and who were
seen at the allergy clinics were studied. All patients reported a
maximum duration of the disease of less than 12 months. All patients but 4 had not been taking antihistamines for at least 5 days
at the time of the first visit. Physical urticarias as well as other
possible causes of urticaria (i.e. food and drug allergy and parasitoses) were excluded by proper investigations. At the first visit,
based on patients’ recent history and according to the number of
wheals and pruritus present, disease activity was estimated following the urticaria activity score recommended by the recent
EAACI guidelines, as shown in table 1 [6].
All patients were prescribed cetirizine 10 mg daily, and were
asked to record their clinical response on a 10-cm visual analogue
scale and to present for a control visit after 10-14 days of treatment. Response to anti-histamine treatment was classified as follows:
(a) excellent or good (total or almost total disappearance of
wheals and pruritus while under treatment);

(b) poor (only partial reduction of pruritus and persistence of
several wheals despite treatment);

(c) absent (no change in severity of CU while under cetirizine).

Basal D-dimer was measured at the first visit. Patients not responding to cetirizine at a licensed dose (10 mg/day) were given
cetirizine 30 mg daily for 1 week and subsequently re-controlled.
In case of failure, systemic steroids (prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day for
5 days to be tapered down in about 10 days) were given.

Pilot Study with Nadroparin and Tranexamic Acid Therapy

Patients showing both (a) a poor response to both cetirizine at
higher than licensed doses and corticosteroids, or requiring high
maintenance daily doses of corticosteroids to control the disease
(and, hence, potential candidates to ciclosporin therapy) and (b)
elevated D-dimer plasma were offered a 2-week treatment course
including subcutaneous nadroparin 11,400 IU once a day plus
oral tranexamic acid 1 g three times a day. The reason why a low
molecular weight heparin was chosen is that these drugs do not
need a regular monitoring of coagulation parameters. Among low
molecular weight heparins, nadroparin was chosen as anticoagulant treatment because it is available in a formulation which allows a single administration each day. Tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic agent is effective in angioedema [7] at the dosage of
1 g three times a day and has been suggested also for the treatment of urticaria. In effect a good response was reported in 2 CU
patients [8], although this finding was not subsequently confirmed in a double-blind study [9].

In those who accepted to undergo this treatment, corticosteroids were stopped and patients were left free to use anti-histamines at licensed doses (e.g. cetirizine 10 mg/day) on demand.
Control visits were performed on days 7 and 14. Anticoagulant
therapy was stopped on day 14, and patients were followed up for
one further month. D-dimer plasma levels were re-measured just

before anticoagulant therapy was stopped. Patients recorded the
daily severity of urticaria on a visual analogue scale throughout
the whole study period. Patients were given thorough explanations about the reasons for the treatment and its possible adverse
effects and gave their informed written consent before the start of
anticoagulant therapy. The protocol was approved by the local
review board.

D-Dimer Measurement

D-dimer plasma levels were measured using a commercial latex agglutination immunoassay kit (Instrumentation Laboratory
Company; Lexington, Mass., USA). The degree of agglutination,
which is directly proportional to plasma D-dimer concentration,
was determined by measuring the decrease of the transmitted
light at 405 nm caused by the latex aggregates [10]. Based on the
calibration standards provided by the manufacturer, levels <278
ng/ml were considered negative. The positive-low and positivehigh control standards provided with the batch used scored 395
ng/ml and 770 ng/ml, respectively.

Statistics

The association between antihistamine response and D-dimer
plasma levels was assessed by the x? test with Yates’ correction. A
p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Disease Activity and Response to Cetirizine 10 mg

Results are summarized in table 2. At the first visit 21,
34, 13 and 0 patients showed a disease activity score of 2,
3-4, 5 or 6, respectively. D-dimer plasma levels were elevated in 14/68 (20.6%) patients (range 306-7,317 ng/ml).
Elevated D-dimer levels were associated with a more se

vere disease, as 10/14 patients showing elevated D-dimer
had a disease activity score of 5. No patient with a slight
(score 1-2) disease showed an elevation of D-dimer plasma levels.

Fourteen of 68 (20.6%) patients reported a poor or absent response to cetirizine 10 mg daily. The lack of a satisfactory response to cetirizine was associated with a
more severe disease, as 10/14 patients showed an intense
disease activity. No patient with a mild disease activity
failed to respond to cetirizine 10 mg.

Elevated D-dimer plasma levels and lack of clinical response to antihistamine treatment were strongly associated, as 12/14 non-responders to cetirizine showed elevated D-dimer plasma levels and 12/14 patients with elevated D-dimer plasma levels did not respond to anti-histamine treatment (p = 0.0001).

Cetirizine at Higher than Licensed Doses and

Systemic Steroids

Of 14 patients not responding to cetirizine 10 mg daily,
only 1 (7%) responded satisfactorily to cetirizine 30 mg
daily. Of the 13 patients remaining, 2 gained a good and
lasting control of the disease by systemic corticosteroid
treatment (table 3). Of the 11 patients remaining, 8 gave
their consent to anticoagulant and antifibrinolytic ther

ment caused a dramatic drop in D-dimer levels in 6/6
patients in whom it was measured. In 3 patients no appreciable benefit was observed, and it was decided to try
another course of corticosteroid therapy, which was effective in 2 cases; the remaining patient had to be switched to cyclosporin (table 4).

In 1 case nadroparin and tranexamic acid were effective but the benefit was short-lived (4 weeks). In 4 patients
the treatment was highly effective, but the disease tended
to relapse some time after anticoagulant/antifibrinolytic
therapy withdrawal. Interestingly, the treatment was resumed in 1 responder (table 4) but this time the baseline
D-dimer level was normal and the treatment proved ineffective.

Discussion

This study confirms that in a subset of patients with
CU, mostly showing a severe disease, activation of the
coagulation cascade up to the production of fibrin and to
fibrinolysis occurs [5]. Whether one or more of the many
factors involved in the coagulation system play a pathogenic role in CU remains to be established. Studies on
animal models have shown that thrombin is able to induce oedema through an increase in vascular permeability, to trigger mast cell degranulation, to activate protease
activated receptor-1 on mast cells, and to generate C5a in
the absence of C3, thus bypassing the whole first part of
the complement cascade [11-15]. Regarding the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved, we observed that CU

Urticaria

patients have elevated plasma levels of prothrombin fragment F1 + 2, a marker of thrombin generation [3]. Subsequently, we found that CU patients show an activation of
the tissue factor (TF) pathway of coagulation cascade [4],
and that in patients with a severe disease such activation
can be so pronounced to produce an elevation of plasma
levels of D-dimer [5]. Immunohistochemical experiments showed TF expression by eosinophils present in
the inflammatory infiltrate of CU skin lesions [16]. These
data indicate that eosinophils are an important source of
TF in CU, according to studies showing that eosinophils
store TF and rapidly transfer it to the cell membrane during activation [17]. The strong expression of TF in CU
lesional skin may be due to eosinophil activation, even if
patients with CU virtually never show peripheral eosinophilia, probably because TF specifically facilitates the
early transendothelial migration of the eosinophils [17].
The activation of the TF pathway of coagulation results
in the generation of thrombin which might contribute to
increase vascular permeability, either directly by an effect on endothelial cells or indirectly by release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells. It has been suggested
that in CU, fibrin deposition occurs in the interstitial
space, outside the vessels, and that the elevated plasma
levels of fibrin split products detected in some patients
are the result of a reflux in the blood stream from the
interstitial space through vasodilated vessels [18]. This
might explain why CU patients do not show an increased
frequency of thrombo-embolic disorders. One relevant
finding of this study is that the strong activation of the
coagulation cascade is associated with a poor response to

antihistamine treatment at licensed doses. What is still
unclear is whether it is the activation of the coagulation
cascade that plays a primary role in activating mast
cells or if such a phenomenon occurs as a result of the
massive release of mediators from mast cells; of course a
third possibility is that the 2 mechanisms (activated coagulation and mast cell degranulation) up-regulate each
other and that both play a relevant role in the pathogenesis of the disease, at least in the most severely affected
subjects.

These observations prompted us to evaluate the potential usefulness of new therapeutic approaches, such as
anticoagulants, in a well-defined subset of patients unresponsive to normal treatments. In effect, there have already been scattered reports, and 1 double-blind placebocontrolled study as well, suggesting that anticoagulants
(either heparin or warfarin) may be effective in the treatment of CU [19-23], although the efficacy of warfarin has
not been confirmed by other authors [24], possibly due
to the heterogeneity of the pathomechanisms involved
in this disease. Further, we and others have previously
shown that heparin is able to turn a markedly positive
intradermal autologous serum skin test negative [25, 26],
and that heparin inhibits the histamine release activity of
sera from CU patients on cultured basophils [26]. This
suggests the possible existence of an activated protease in
serum that is inhibited (either by non-specific binding or
by specific neutralization) by heparin. The good response
to the association of low molecular weight heparin plus
tranexamic acid in a subset of patients provides indirect
evidence of the relevance of the coagulation cascade activation in the pathogenesis of the disease. Similarly, Cox
and Friedmann [27] found in serum of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis a factor involved in the formation
of lesions, activated by clotting and inhibited by heparin
and by the anti-fibrinolytic agent e-amino caproic acid.
Moreover, it is interesting to note that heparin can also

bind eosinophil cationic protein [28], a mediator released
by activated eosinophils which are involved in the pathophysiology of CU. For ethical reasons it would have not
been possible to carry out the present study in a doubleblind and placebo-controlled fashion, as patients had severe, long-lasting, and unremitting CU unresponsive to
standard treatments and strongly asked for an alternative
reatment. Nonetheless, we think that the use of visual
analogue scale evaluations along with the frequent conrol visits should have minimized the risk of a false-posiive response. The anticoagulant/antifibrinolytic treatment given was well tolerated and virtually harmless in
all cases, although it should be noted that this conclusion
is based on a short-term observation. D-dimer plasma
evels dropped dramatically following the treatment with
nadroparin and tranexamic acid, thus showing the activity of drugs given. The treatment was dramatically effecive in 5/8 (62.5%) patients, the clinical effect appearing
2 days after the start of therapy. Due to the fear of severe
adverse reactions (bleeding) in this pilot study, the treatment was given only for 2 weeks; thus, not surprisingly,
he benefit was short-lived in 3 out of 4 responders who
had to be eventually switched to other treatments. The
excellent response observed in 1 patient, when D-dimer
evels were high, followed by a lack of response when Ddimer levels had normalized, is extremely interesting. In
general, one gets the impression that anticoagulant/anti
fibrinolytic therapy may be effective and helpful in the
short term in a subset of patients as it blocks one of the
amplification mechanisms of the inflammation, but it
loses efficacy as soon as mechanisms other than coagulation cascade involved in the disease become prevalent.
Based on these limited and preliminary data it seems that
nadroparin and tranexamic acid may find a place in the
treatment of some patients with refractory CU and elevated D-dimer levels.
