ABSTRACT

 

BACKGROUND
In the majority of patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria, most currently available therapies do not result in complete symptom control. Ligelizumab is a next
generation high-affinity humanized monoclonal anti-IgE antibody. Data are limited
regarding the dose-response relationship of ligelizumab and the efficacy and safety
of ligelizumab as compared with omalizumab and placebo in patients who have
moderate-to-severe chronic spontaneous urticaria that is inadequately controlled
with H,-antihistamines at approved or increased doses, alone or in combination with
H,-antihistamines or leukotriene-receptor antagonists.

METHODS

In a phase 2b dose-finding trial, we randomly assigned patients to receive ligelizumab at a dose of 24 mg, 72 mg, or 240 mg, omalizumab at a dose of 300 mg, or
placebo, administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks for a period of 20 weeks, or a
single 120-mg dose of ligelizumab. Disease symptoms of hives, itch, and angioedema
were monitored by means of weekly activity scores. The main objective was to determine a dose-response relationship for the complete control of hives (indicated by a
weekly hives-severity score of 0, on a scale from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating
greater severity); the primary end point of this response was assessed at week 12.
Complete symptom control was indicated by a weekly urticaria activity score of 0 (on
a scale from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating greater severity). Safety was analyzed throughout the trial.

RESULTS
A total of 382 patients underwent randomization. At week 12, a total of 30%, 51%,
and 42% of the patients treated with 24 mg, 72 mg, and 240 mg, respectively, of
ligelizumab had complete control of hives, as compared with 26% of the patients in
the omalizumab group and no patients in the placebo group. A dose-response relationship was established. At week 12, a total of 30%, 44%, and 40% of the patients
treated with 24 mg, 72 mg, and 240 mg, respectively, of ligelizumab had complete
control of symptoms, as compared with 26% of the patients in the omalizumab group
and no patients in the placebo group. In this small and short trial, no safety concerns
regarding ligelizumab or omalizumab emerged.

CONCLUSIONS
A higher percentage of patients had complete control of symptoms of chronic spontaneous urticaria with ligelizumab therapy of 72 mg or 240 mg than with omalizumab
or placebo. (Funded by Novartis Pharma; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02477332.)

g” “ HRONIC SPONTANEOUS URTICARIA IS A
skin disorder that is characterized by the
‘ occurrence of itchy wheals (hives), angioederna, or both for 6 weeks or more in the absence of specific external stimuli.!? Studies have
indicated that chronic spontaneous urticaria has
a prevalence of approximately 1 case per 200 persons in adult European populations.** Evidence
suggests that chronic spontaneous urticaria has
a long duration®’ and can have a negative effect
on quality of life.** The pathogenesis of chronic
spontaneous urticaria is not fully clear, but it is
known to involve autoimmune mechanisms in
most patients by means of IgG autoantibodies
against the high-affinity receptor for the Fc region
of IgE (FceRJ) or less frequently against IgE and
IgE autoantigens.”?

Standard first-line treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria consists of nonsedating (secondgeneration) H,-antihistamines at locally approved
doses, with escalation up to four times the approved dose used off-label as second-line treatment; even so, the disease is still uncontrolled in
some patients.'"*"5 The revised guidelines regarding the treatment of urticaria from the European
Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACD, the Global Allergy and Asthma
European Network (GA*LEN), the European
Dermatology Forum (EDF) and the World Allergy Organization (WAO)! recommend the use
of omalizumab as add-on third-line therapy to
H,-antihistamines. The goal of therapy, as noted
in the current treatment guidelines, is complete control of the disease, yet some patients
have symptoms that remain uncontrolled with
the current standard of care.! To date, add-on
therapy with omalizumab has been the most
effective treatment in patients who continue to
have symptoms while they are taking H,-antihistamines,’** but some patients do not have
a response, and better treatment options are
needed.'°

Ligelizumab is a new high-affinity humanized
monoclonal anti-IgE antibody that has previously
shown dose-dependent and time-dependent suppression of free IgE, basophil FceRI, basophil
surface IgE, and skin-prick test responses to allergen that was superior in extent and duration
to that observed with omalizumab.” In a phase
2b trial, we examined the efficacy and safety of
ligelizumab as compared with omalizumab and

N ENGLJ MED 381;14 NEJM.ORG

placebo in patients with chronic spontaneous
urticaria that was inadequately controlled with
standard-of-care therapy including H,-antihistamines.

 

METHODS

 

TRIAL DESIGN AND OVERSIGHT

This phase 2b, dose-finding, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled and placebocontrolled trial was designed to establish a
dose-response relationship for ligelizumab and
to evaluate its efficacy and safety as compared
with omalizumab and placebo (Fig. 1). The trial
consisted of a screening period (days —14 to 1),
a treatment period (days 1 to 140 [20 weeks]),
and a follow-up period after the cessation of the
trial regimens (days 141 to 309 [24 weeks]). Patients who remained in the follow-up period for
at least 12 weeks and had active disease (defined
as a mean weekly urticaria activity score [measured twice daily] of 212; scores range from 0 to
42, with higher scores indicating greater severity; minimally important difference [MID], 9.5 to
10.0 points)*”’ were eligible to enter an extension
study (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02649218)
from week 32 onward. The trial protocol, with
the statistical analysis plan, is available with the
full text of this article at NEJM.org.

This trial was designed and sponsored by
Novartis Pharma. The institutional review board
at each participating center approved the protocol. Patients provided written informed consent
before any assessment was performed. Data were
collected by the trial investigators according to
Good Clinical Practice guidelines and were analyzed by the sponsor. The first draft of the
manuscript was written by a medical writer paid
by the sponsor, with critical input and approval
from all authors. All the authors critically reviewed each manuscript draft, provided substantial input on the content, and made the decision
to submit the manuscript for publication. The
authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness
of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the
protocol.

PATIENTS

Eligible patients were 18 to 75 years of age and
had chronic spontaneous urticaria that was inadequately controlled with H,-antihistamines at

The single 120-mg dose of ligelizumab was chosen in order to characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ligelizumab. Data from this group were used to assess the duration of response and to correlate this information with the concentration of drug in the serum at the time when symptoms reappeared. Patients who remained
in the follow-up period for at least 12 weeks and had active disease (weekly urticaria activity score of =12 ona scale
from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating greater severity) could enter an extension study from week 32 onward.

approved or increased doses alone or in combination with H,-antihistamines or leukotrienereceptor antagonists. Key inclusion criteria were
the following: mild-to-moderate chronic spontaneous urticaria, defined as a weekly urticaria
activity score of at least 16 (disease activity categories are as follows: 0, symptom free; 1 to 6,
well-controlled urticaria; 7 to 15, mild urticaria;
16 to 27, moderate urticaria; and 28 to 42, severe
urticaria”); a weekly hives-severity score of at
least 8 (scores range from 0 to 21, with higher
values indicating greater severity; MID, 5.0 to 5.5
points)”’ during the 7 days before randomization
(day 1); and an in-clinic urticaria activity score of
at least 4 (scores range from 1 to 6, with higher
values indicating greater severity; MID, not available) on at least one of the screening visit days.
Key exclusion criteria were the following: previous exposure to omalizumab or ligelizumab,
any other skin disease that is associated with
chronic itching that might confound the trial
evaluations and results, and a clearly defined
underlying cause of chronic urticaria other than

chronic spontaneous urticaria (e.g., inducible
urticaria).

The demographic and clinical characteristics
of the patients and the disease activity were elicited or measured at baseline. The Chronic Urticaria Index (CU Index; Viracor-IBT Laboratories),
an in vitro basophil histamine-release assay in
which a serum sample obtained from a patient
is mixed with donor basophils and the released
histamine levels are measured by a quantitative
enzyme immunoassay, was performed at baseline. A positive CU Index (scores range from 1 to
50, with scores 210 representing a positive result) indicates that a patient has either an autoimmune basis for the urticaria or an alternative
histamine-releasing factor that has been associated with greater disease severity than that in
patients with a negative CU Index.**” The serum
samples for this analysis were obtained centrally
and analyzed by Viracor-IBT Laboratories. From
the time that samples were obtained until analysis, they were kept frozen to ensure sample
integrity.

TRIAL PROCEDURES
Patients were randomly assigned, in a 2:2:2:1:1:1
ratio, to receive one of the following trial regimens: 240 mg of ligelizumab every 4 weeks, 72 mg
of ligelizumab every 4 weeks, 300 mg of omalizumab every 4 weeks, 24 mg of ligelizumab every
4 weeks, placebo every 4 weeks, or a single 120-mg
dose of ligelizumab at week 0 followed by placebo
every 4 weeks; the treatment period was 20 weeks
(Fig. 1). The single 120-mg dose of ligelizumab
was used to gain blinded washout information,
to determine the level of ligelizumab in serum
that was associated with the return of itch and
hives symptoms, and to identify an appropriate
administration interval for phase 3 trials.
Adjustments to the doses of trial agents were
not permitted. Nonsedating H,-antihistamines
were used as background medication and as rescue medication as needed during the screening,
treatment, and follow-up periods. This trial required concurrent use of H,-antihistamines (at
locally approved doses or at increased doses up
to four times the locally approved dose) alone
or in combination with H,-antihistamines or
leukotriene-receptor antagonists (montelukast,
zafirlukast, or pranlukast) as background medication. It was recommended that patients continue taking a stable background medication
throughout the trial, and patients were not permitted to switch their rescue medications.

END-POINT MEASURES
The main objective of the trial was to establish
a dose-response relationship with respect to the
achievement of complete hives response (weekly
hives-severity score of 0) at week 12. Complete
hives response was chosen as the primary end
point because hives were considered to be a more
objective symptom than itch and are specific to
chronic spontaneous urticaria; itch is subjective
and nonspecific and can be of different origins.
We chose week 12 as the time point for the assessment of the primary end point because this
was also the time point for the primary end
point in phase 3 trials of omalizumab.°”°
Secondary end points included the following:
the efficacy of specific ligelizumab doses of 24 mg,
72 mg, and 240 mg as compared with omalizumab at a dose of 300 mg with respect to the
achievement of complete hives response at weeks
12 and 20; the efficacy of ligelizumab at doses

of 24 mg, 72 mg, and 240 mg as compared with
placebo and with omalizumab at a dose of 300 mg
in the mean change from baseline in the weekly
hives-severity score, in the weekly itch-severity
score (scores range from 0 to 21, with higher
scores indicating greater severity; MID, 4.5 to
5.0 points), in the weekly urticaria activity score,
and in the weekly angioedema activity score
(scores range from 0 to 105, with higher scores
indicating greater severity; MID, not available);
and the safety of ligelizumab as compared with
placebo and with omalizumab at a dose of 300 mg
during the 20 weeks of the treatment phase and
24 weeks of follow-up.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

The null hypothesis of a constant dose-response
curve for the primary efficacy end point was
tested at a significance level of 5% against the
one-sided alternative hypothesis of a nonconstant
dose-response curve with the use of the multiple
comparison procedure and modeling method,
which indicates the potential dose-response relationship.*°*! The dose-response curve was modeled as a weighted average of prespecified model
candidates with the use of bootstrap sampling.
The dose-response model was derived from testing a range of ligelizumab doses, starting at 24 mg
and then 72 mg and 240 mg, with placebo considered to be the zero dose. For the primary
variable, patients who had data missing because
of discontinuation before the week 12 assessment were considered not to have had a response,
regardless of their last available assessment of
the weekly hives-severity score.

Since the statistical analysis plan did not include a provision for correcting for multiplicity
when tests were conducted for secondary or other
outcomes, results are reported as point estimates with 95% confidence intervals. This was
a small and clinically nondirective trial. The widths
of the confidence intervals have not been adjusted for multiplicity, so the intervals should
not be used to infer any effects for secondary
outcomes.

total of 338 patients (88%) completed the treatment phase of the trial (Fig. $1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). There were
no notable imbalances among the trial groups
regarding the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients at baseline (Table 1).

PRIMARY END POINT

The main objective of the trial was achieved, with
ligelizumab showing a dose-response relationship with respect to the achievement of complete
hives response (weekly hives-severity score of 0)
at week 12 (primary end point) in patients with
chronic spontaneous urticaria. The dose-response
curve showed a steep dose-response relationship
with a plateau starting close to the 72-mg dose
of ligelizumab (Fig. 2A); no further improvement
in response was noted with the 240-mg dose.

SECONDARY END POINTS
At week 12, a total of 30%, 51%, and 42% of the
patients treated with 24 mg, 72 mg, and 240 mg,
respectively, of ligelizumab had a complete hives
response, as compared with 26% of the patients
in the omalizumab group (Fig. 2B) and no patients in the placebo group. The response with
the 72-mg dose of ligelizumab was maintained
at week 20, with 51% of the patients having a
response, as compared with 34% of those in the
omalizumab group. A total of 45% of the patients in the group that received the 240-mg
dose of ligelizumab had a response. The response
regarding itch severity (weekly itch-severity score
of 0) showed a pattern similar to that seen with
the weekly hives-severity score. Details are provided in Figure S2 in the Supplementary Appendix.
At week 12, a total of 30%, 44%, and 40% of
patients treated with 24 mg, 72 mg, and 240 mg,
respectively, of ligelizumab had complete control
of symptoms (weekly urticaria activity score of 0),
as compared with 26% of the patients in the
omalizumab group and none of the patients in
the placebo group (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary
Appendix). At week 20, a response was observed
in 39% of the patients who received the 72-mg
dose of ligelizumab and in 40% of those who
received the 240-mg dose, as compared with
31% of those in the omalizumab group and 5%
of those in the placebo group. After the end of
the treatment phase, the median time to loss
of response in patients who had had a response

at week 20 was 3 weeks, 4 weeks, and 10.5 weeks
among patients who received 24 mg, 72 mg, and
240 mg, respectively, of ligelizumab, as compared
with 4 weeks among patients in the omalizumab
group and 1 week among those in the placebo
group.

The median (with interquartile ranges) and
mean weekly hives-severity scores are shown in
Figure 3. Patients in the groups that received the
72-mg or 240-mg doses of ligelizumab had median weekly hives-severity scores close to 0 from
weeks 12 to 20. The mean changes from baseline to week 32 in the weekly hives-severity
score, itch-severity score, and urticaria activity
score are shown in Figure S3 in the Supplementary Appendix. The single 120-mg dose of ligelizumab resulted in suppression of symptoms that
was similar to that seen with the 72-mg and
240-mg doses at week 4 and that lasted until
week 8. At week 12, the mean changes from
baseline in the angioedema activity score were
-21.1, -37.6, and —27.3 among patients treated
with 24 mg, 72 mg, and 240 mg, respectively,
of ligelizumab, as compared with —23.1 in the
omalizumab group and —23.6 in the placebo
group (Fig. $3 in the Supplementary Appendix).

SAFETY

A higher proportion of adverse events that were
considered by the investigators to be related to
treatment was seen in the groups that received
the 72-mg and 240-mg doses of ligelizumab
than in the other groups (Table 2). These results
were driven by mild or moderate injection-site
reactions (in 4% of the patients in the 72-mg
group and 7% of those in the 240-mg group) and
by mild injection-site erythema (in 2% and 6%,
respectively). All other adverse events that were
considered to be possibly related to treatment
during the trial were reported in three or fewer
patients per group, with no meaningful differences among the trial groups. Serious adverse
events were reported in 7%, 2%, and 2% of the
patients treated with 24 mg, 72 mg, and 240 mg,
respectively, of ligelizumab, as compared with
4% of the patients treated with omalizumab and
9% of those who received placebo.

The most frequently reported adverse events
(occurring in >10% of the patients overall) were
viral upper respiratory tract infection (in 20%),
upper respiratory tract infection (in 13%), and

Figure 2. Dose-Response Curve for Hives-Severity Response at Week 12 and Forest Plot of the Odds Ratios
for Response at Week 12.

Panel A shows the dose-response curve with the median of 1000 bootstrap samples; the shaded area indicates the
20th to 80th percentile. Dots with error bars represent point estimates and an asymptotic 60% confidence interval
for each dose in observed data. The active comparator was omalizumab. The weekly hives-severity score measures
the severity of hives over a period of 7 days on a scale ranging from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating greater severity. One sample with an artificial response was created in the placebo group to achieve model fit. Panel B shows
a forest plot of the odds ratios (ligelizumab vs. omalizumab) for response (defined as a score of 0 on each assessment) at week 12. The primary end point of complete hives response (weekly hives-severity score of 0) was assessed
at week 12. Secondary end points included the weekly itch-severity and urticaria activity scores. The weekly itchseverity score measures the severity of itch over a period of 7 days on a scale ranging from 0 to 21, with higher
scores indicating greater severity. The weekly urticaria activity score is a composite of the weekly itch-severity and
hives-severity scores; the scale ranges from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating greater severity. Missing data were
imputed as no response. The statistical model used logistic regression with adjustment for background medication
type and score on the Chronic Urticaria Index (CU Index); one patient was not included in the model because the
patient did not have a CU Index score at baseline.

headache (in 11%). Viral upper respiratory tract
infection was reported more frequently in the
placebo group (30%) than in the four groups that
received ligelizumab (15 to 24%) or in the omalizumab group (20%). No deaths or anaphylaxis
events were reported in any of the trial groups.

 

DISCUSSION

 

Most currently available therapies for chronic
spontaneous urticaria do not result in complete

control of symptoms in the majority of patients.
The main objective of this trial was achieved,
with a clear dose-response relationship being
observed with ligelizumab in the achievement of
complete hives response (weekly hives-severity
score of 0) at week 12 (primary end point) in
patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria. Our
trial showed that 72 mg of ligelizumab, administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks, resulted in
complete hives response in 51% of the patients,
whereas 26% of the patients treated with omaliz

umab at a dose of 300 mg, which is the dose that
has been considered to be effective in other
studies,°*! had this response.

The frequency of response according to the
weekly urticaria activity score in the omalizumab
group at week 12 was lower than in previous
studies (34 to 44%).°*! An explanation for this
finding may be that a higher percentage of patients in our trial had a positive CU Index (indicating an autoimmune type IIb component to
their chronic spontaneous urticaria), had angioedema (Table 1), and had received treatment
with elevated doses of H,-antihistamines or combination therapies. Previous studies have shown
that a positive CU Index was associated with
increased severity of chronic urticaria and that
significantly more patients with refractory chronic urticaria had a positive CU Index than those
who had had a response to H,-antihistamines.*””

In the current trial, responses according to
changes from baseline in the weekly hives-severity score, itch-severity score, and urticaria activity
score were observed as early as week 4 after receipt of the 72-mg, 120-mg, and 240-mg doses
of ligelizumab, thus indicating an onset of action within this time frame for ligelizumab. The
suppression of symptomis after the single 120-mg
dose of ligelizumab was maintained until week
8, after which symptoms returned to the level
observed with placebo. In contrast, a partial relapse of symptoms was noted with the 72-mg
dose of ligelizumab toward the end of the
4-week administration interval. These data suggest that although the 72-mg dose of ligelizumab
led to rapid control of symptoms, a dose higher
than 72 mg could potentially provide enough
drug effect throughout the administration interval to minimize relapse of symptoms and offer
sustained control of symptoms throughout the
4-week administration interval. In support of
this sustained treatment effect, the median time
to loss of complete response in patients who had
a weekly urticaria activity score of 0 at week 20
(end of the treatment phase) was greatest in the
group that was treated with 240 mg of ligelizumab (10.5 weeks) and was similar in the
groups that received 72 mg of ligelizumab or
300 mg of omalizumab (4 weeks). Previous stud
ies of omalizumab have indicated that some patients have a return of symptoms within 4 weeks
(i.e., before the administration of the next
dose).>?* Future studies will be needed to determine the dose of ligelizumab that results in a
sustained clinical response throughout the administration interval.

The percentage of patients who had at least
one adverse event was similar among the ligelizumab dose groups, the omalizumab group, and
the placebo group. Adverse events were reported
in 84%, 75%, and 74% of the patients who were
treated with 24 mg, 72 mg, and 240 mg, respectively, of ligelizumab every 4 weeks and in 88%
of the patients who received the single 120-mg
dose of ligelizumab, 73% of those in the omalizumab group, and 79% of those in the placebo
group. The higher incidence of injection-site reactions and injection-site erythema observed with
ligelizumab at the doses of 72 mg and 240 mg
than in the other groups may have been associated with differences in the administration volumes and compositions. The administration of
the 240-mg dose of ligelizumab involved two
injections of active drug (1.0 ml each), as compared with injections of one active drug (0.6 ml)
and one placebo (0.6 ml) that were used for the
72-mg dose. No cases of anaphylaxis were reported in this trial.

In conclusion, in patients with moderate-tosevere chronic spontaneous urticaria, ligelizumab
showed a clear dose-response relationship with
regard to complete hives response (weekly hivesseverity score of 0) at week 12. Ligelizumab resulted in rapid and sustained symptom control
in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria.
In this small trial, side effects or laboratory abnormalities were not dose-limiting. Larger and
longer trials are needed to establish the clinical
efficacy of ligelizumab in patients with chronic
spontaneous urticaria and its comparative pro
file with that of omalizumab.
