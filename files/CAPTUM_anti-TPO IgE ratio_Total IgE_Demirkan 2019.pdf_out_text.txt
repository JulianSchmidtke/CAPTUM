Introduction: Autologous serum skin test (ASST) is a rapid, in-vivo clinical test to detect functional autoantibodies
in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), but the rationale for its use in acute urticaria (AU) is unknown.
Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of ASST among patients with AU or CSU.

Material and methods: Treatment-naive adult (age > 18 years) patients with a diagnosis of AU (< 6 weeks’ duration) and CSU were enrolled prospectively in a cross-sectional study. Healthy age- and sex-matched subjects served
as controls. Besides a detailed history and physical examination, ASST, total immunoglobulin E (IgE), freeT3 (fT3),

freeT4 (fT4), anti-thyroglobulin, and anti-TPO levels were assessed in all subjects.

Results: Of 101 subjects, mean age was 34.35 +12.68 years and the study comprised 58.4% of females with no difference between AU (n = 27), CSU (n = 46), and control groups (n = 28). The ratio of positivity in ASST was similar between AU (25.9%) and CSU groups (21.7%), but higher than in controls (10.7%, p = 0.33 for all). The ratio of patients
with high total IgE levels (> 100 IU/ml) in AU (85.2%) and CSU (65.2%) groups was similar (p = 0.06), but significantly
higher than in the control group (10.7%) (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). The CSU group had significantly higher abnormal
thyroid test results (45.7%) than AU (14.8%) and control groups (3.6%) (p = 0.01 and p < 0.001), whereas patients
with clinically diagnosed thyroiditis were only in the CSU group (6.5%). In logistic regression analysis, there was no
relation found among the possible risk factors for ASST, even if analysed separately as AU, CSU and control groups.
Conclusions: Even though thyroid function test levels were found to be related with CSU, and total IgE was associated with urticaria, ASST was found to be of importance. This study confirms that ASST was insufficient to
demonstrate autoimmunity and acute-chronic urticaria nature. Further tests indicating auto-antibodies in AU and

 

CSU are needed.

Key words: autologous serum skin test, chronic urticaria, autoimmunity.

Introduction

Autologous serum skin test (ASST) is an intraderma
application of the patient’s serum sample to detect autoantibodies against high-affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE)
receptor, or IgE with a high sensitivity and specificity o
about 80% [1]. Positivity in ASST with an induration larger

than 1.5 mm indicates au

a ratio of up to 55.55% [2, 4-7]. Acute urticaria (AU) which
lasts shorter than 6 weeks, has identifiable aetiology only
in 50% of patients. General laboratory studies are not
indicated in AU, however etiologic examination including
ASST was shown to presume progression toward CSU [8].

adults. We hypothesized that ASST is useful to identify
aetiology not only in CSU, but also in AU.

Material and methods

This study was a prospective cross-sectional study
carried out between 2016 and 2017. It was approved by
the Local Ethical Committee of the Kirikkale University
(2016/11/08). Patients were recruited from the Departments of Dermatology and Allergy in the Kirikkale University Hospital.

The diagnosis of AU and CSU was done according
to the criteria of the European Academy of Allergy and
Clinical Immunology (EAACI) [1]. Recruitment criteria for
patients included: 1) untreated urticaria patients, 2) diagnosed by an expert with a specialty in dermatology
or allergy, 3) if the patient had a history of recurrent
wheals over 6 weeks he/she was grouped as CSU, or vice
versa, 4) the patients had no definite causes in history
such as allergic diseases, autoimmune diseases, infections, or drug allergy evidence. Exclusion criteria were:
1) identified urticaria reason such as physical, cholinergic,
vasculitis or hereditary angioedema, 2) using antihistamine within a week, steroid or immunosuppressive drugs
within a month, 3) having an exact cause of urticaria during the study follow-up, 4) pregnant or nursing women
were excluded. In AU, AST was not performed until the
symptoms completely subsided.

Clinical details of all subjects were recorded. Selected
patients were subjected to ASST and laboratory investigations. The ASST was performed with 0.5 ml of the patient’s own serum injected intradermally into the flexor
aspect of the forearm; 0.5 ml of saline was injected 3 to

 

 

 

5 cm away as a control. The test was considered positive
if the diameter of the papule after 30 min was 1.5 mm or
greater than that of the saline papule [9].

Anti-thyroglobulin, antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO),
free (f) T3, f14, and TSH tests were also performed as autoimmunity indicators in addition to total immunoglobulin (Ig) gE tests in Immunoassay Analyzer (Roche, Basel,
Switzerland). Deficiency levels of total IgE (< 100 IU/ml),
sSTSH (0.5-5 WU/ml), fT3 (2.2-4 pg/ml), f14 (0.76-1.46 ng/
ml), anti-thyroglobulin (< 40 IU/ml), anti-TPO (< 35 IU/ml)
were determined according to the manufacturer’s standards. Abnormality in thyroid tests was defined as any
thyroid test out of the normal range. A patient with clinical thyroiditis was defined as with abnormal TSH, fT3 and
fT4 levels besides high levels of thyroid antibodies.

 

Statistical analysis

The data were recorded and processed using SPSS
17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The positive rates are
expressed as percentages and were analysed using the
x? test. Numeric variables are expressed as means and
were analysed using the Student’s T-test. A p-value < 0.05
was considered significant.

 

Results

The study group was composed of adults with
a mean age of 34.35 +12.68 years, and a female dominance (58.4%) (Table 1). Patients were treatment naive
except 8.7% of the CSU group who used anti-allergic
drugs long before admission.

Rationale for the autologous serum skin test in acute versus chronic urticaria

 

Mean serum total IgE levels were significantly higher
in patients with urticaria than the control group, but were
similar between AU and CSU groups. Mean f14, anti-thyroglobulin, and anti-TPO levels in the CSU group were
higher than both AU and control groups (Table 2).

The ratio of ASST positivity was insignificantly higher in
the AU (25.9%) and CSU group (21.7%) than in the control
group (10.7%) (Figure 1). When serum test values were defined as abnormal according to normal limits, the results
were also similar as mentioned above. In logistic regression
analysis, no significant risk factor was determined for ASST
positivity even if analysed separately in groups.

Discussion

The gold standard for the diagnosis of autoimmunity in CSU is to find positivity in these three tests; ASST
positivity (auto-reactivity), bioassay positivity (basophile
histamine release assay or basophile activation indicator
expression), and immunoassay positivity (Western blot
or ELISA immunoreactivity) [2]. However, it is not a useful
method to be applied to all CSU patients in practical life,
since they need specialized laboratories.

Frequency of ASST positivity

ASST positivity in patients with CSU was reported between 4.1% and 82.1%, with different methods for positivity
criteria [1-3].|n this study, the ratio of ASST positivity was
almost one fourth of the urticaria patients and one tenth
of healthy ones. Even though these results were lower than
in some studies, similarity between urticaria and healthy
subjects was a frequent result as in other articles. For example, Taskapan et al. found that its positivity was 53% in
CSU patients, 20% in patients with allergic rhinitis/asthma,
and 56% in healthy controls [2]. Furthermore, this was one
of the first studies comparing ASST positivity among AU
and CSU patients. In PubMed search with key words of AU
and ASST, there was only one research paper published by
Magen et al. [8]. They reported ASST positivity as 63.4%
in the CSU, and 23.3% in the AU group. However, this significant difference disappeared after 7 weeks of survey.
The contrary results between the two studies may be attributed to different inclusion criteria. As we know this is
the first study with patient enrolment from two different
departments that deal with urticaria, and this side of the
study makes sense if the whole population was included.
We suggested that urticaria patients who were admitted to
the Allergy Department had a suspicion of allergy, especially
to drugs, whereas patients in the Dermatology Department
were reported to have autoimmunity in a published paper.

 

 

Reliability of ASST

In this study, ASST was found to be insufficient to
differentiate autoimmunity in patients from healthy
subjects. Actually, it has been known that ASST is not

specific for CSU. For example, Given et al. found ASST
positivity in patients with alopecia and vitiligo [10]. Its
sensitivity and specificity was reported as approximately
70-80% [11]. It has been reported that this test was deendent on histamine and mast cell response, and can
e passively transferred to healthy individuals. However,
it is controversial whether circulating immune complexes
are responsible for this response since only 50% of the
patients with CSU had autoantibodies filled up [12, 13].
Likewise, heating the serum to a certain temperature at
which IgE was inactivated, did not change the positivity of the ASST [12, 14-16]. In this case, it would not be
appropriate to consider urticaria patients with positive
ASST as autoimmune ones [17-19]. Furthermore, in some
studies, there was no relationship between ASST and
treatment response or disease course [19]. These were
the points that make the reliability of ASST doubtful.

 

 

Reproducibility of ASST

There are controversial reports advocating that the ASST
is a reproducible test [16, 20-23]. Magen et al. observed that
there was a conversion in ASST results of patients with CSU
in follow-ups as positivity to negativity or vice versa. On the
other hand, Eryilmaz et al. argued that ASST should be repeated several times to use it as a screening test for autoimmune urticaria [24]. Even though there was no follow-up
in this study, the similarity of ASST results between AU,
CSU, and healthy groups would suggest that there would
be no change if patients with AU were followed up. We
concluded that ASST was not rational in patients with CSU.
ASST shows neither diagnostic value for autoimmunity nor
reflects urticaria activity. It may be considered that ASST
does not contribute to disease management.

Thyroid function test and total IgE results

Studies suggesting the role of thyroid autoimmunity and
its relation with ASST in CSU are controversial. In some, ASST
positivity was found to be higher in CSU patients that had
thyroid autoantibodies than patients without [13, 25, 26].
Furthermore, an exact relationship in CSU patients between
having higher autoimmune disease with determined autoantibody and ASST positivity was written in guidelines [1],
even though there were opposite results advocating usefulness of ASST in showing autoimmunity [27, 28]. Finally, it was
emphasized to look at thyroid autoantibodies although there
was no significant difference of ASST between the CSU group
and the control group [29]. Likewise, this study showed that
clinically thyroiditis and/or abnormality in thyroid tests was
significantly higher in the CSU group than the AU and healthy
groups. Thus, we recommend performing routine thyroid autoantibodies and thyroid functional tests in CSU.

In this study, total IgE levels were significantly higher in
urticaria patients than in the healthy group, which made us
to think that patients of urticaria were rich of IgE levels as
a target for mast or basophile cell mediator release. However, IgE levels are found to be unimportant to differentiate
between AU and CSU patients.

 

 

Conclusions

Even though thyroid function tests were found to be
related with CSU, and total IgE was associated with urticaria, ASST was found to be of importance. This study
confirms that ASST is insufficient to demonstrate autoimmunity and acute-chronic urticaria nature. Further
research about auto-antibodies in AU and CSU is needed.
