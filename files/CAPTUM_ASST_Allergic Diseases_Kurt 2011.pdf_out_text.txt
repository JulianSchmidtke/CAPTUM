Abstract Autologous serum skin test (ASST) is mostly
used in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) to show autoreactivity. Interleukin-18 (IL-18) has also been shown to
be involved in autoimmune conditions. To investigate the
role of autoreactivity assessed by ASST in CSU and
respiratory diseases and to investigate whether this autoreactive state is related to IL-18 level or other clinical
covariates. Fifty-five patients with CSU (mean age:
40.3 + 12.3 years), 70 patients with persistent asthma
(mean age: 43.7 + 9.6 years), 21 patients with seasonal
allergic rhinitis (SAR) (mean age: 35.5 + 11.8 years) and
20 normal controls (mean age: 37.7 + 9.8) were included.
All subjects underwent a laboratory examination and skin
prick test. ASST was performed and serum IL-18 levels
were measured in all subjects. Positive response to ASST
and serum IL-18 levels were higher in CSU patients than
those with respiratory diseases (asthma and SAR)

(P = 0.034 and 0.002, respectively) and normal controls
(P = 0.004 and 0.031, respectively). Considering all
patients, IL-18 levels were higher in patients with positive
ASST (301.8 + 194.4 vs. 241.8 + 206.3 pg/ml, P =
0.036) than ASST negative patients. ASST response was
associated with disease severity in CSU (P = 0.037) and
asthma patients (P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed
that positive response to ASST was significantly associated
with diagnosis of CSU (OR: 3.13, 95% CI: 1.25-7.87) and
female gender (OR: 3.98, 95% CI: 1.19-13.38). ASST
response could be related with activity of the disease. A
positive ASST response found in respiratory diseases
patients suggests that it may occur as a result of some
inflammatory events during the diseases’ process.

Introduction

Chronic urticaria (CU), recurrent hives lasting more than
6 weeks, remains one of the diseases with unexplained
pathogenetic mechanism in spite of recent developments.
The term chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is used to
define those patients with no known cause of urticaria such
as physical factors, drugs and foods. One of the proposed
mechanisms in CU is autoimmunity occurring in approximately 40-50% of patients with CU [15]. There is evidence
for histamine releasing activity in CU due to autoantibodies
against to either IgE or high affinity IgE receptor (FceRIx)
[16]. It is suggested that these autoantibodies cause the
development of wheals with mast cell activation and histamine release in dermal mast cells. These histamine
releasing-autoantibodies directed against FceRIa or IgE

can be detected in vivo by autologous serum skin test
(ASST). Previous studies have shown that ASST was
positive in about half of the CU patients [22, 23, 25].
However, ASST is not confined to only CU patients but it
is also found in respiratory diseases such as asthma and
allergic rhinitis in which the pathogenic effect of ASST is
not known [9, 12, 25, 26].

Interleukin (IL)-18, previously named as IFN-y inducing
factor, has been shown to exert autoimmune regulatory
activity on both Thl and Th2 cytokines suggesting a
complex role on Thi and Th2 inflammatory responses [17,
29]. IL-18 has effects on IFN-y, proinflammatory cytokines
and other cytokines probably depending on the environment [11]. By these effects IL-18 exerts a Thl type
response requiring co-stimulation with IL-12, IL-15 or IL-2
and a Th2 type response without IL-12 and IL-23 [8].
Several studies have demonstrated that IL-18 activity is
increased in Th2 type diseases such as asthma, allergic
rhinitis and atopic dermatitis [2, 24, 28, 30]. IL-18 has been
suggested to have a role in autoimmune activation and
continuation by the effects on Thl/Th2 balance in synergy
with IL-12 [8]. A previous study suggested a possible role
for IL-18 which was correlated with activity of disease in
ASST positive CSU patients [27].

We aimed to investigate the role of autoreactivity
assessed by ASST in the patients with CSU and respiratory
diseases and to investigate whether this autoreactive state is
related to IL-18 levels or other clinical covariates.

Methods
Subjects

This prospective study included 55 patients with chronic
urticaria (39 women and 16 men, mean age: 40.3 +
12.3 years), 70 patients with persistent asthma (51 women
and 19 men, mean age: 43.7 + 9.6 years), 21 patients with
seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) (14 women and 7 men,
mean age: 35.5 + 11.8 years) and 20 normal controls (12
women and 8 men, mean age: 37.7 + 9.8).

All CSU patients were referred to our tertiary university
clinic reporting recurrent, transitory, itchy weals, lasting
for at least 6 weeks. Patients with physical urticaria, dermographism, vasculitis, food intolerance, allergic contact
dermatitis and other skin disorders that may affect the skin
test results were excluded. Activity of urticaria was
assessed by determining the number and size of weals at
the time when ASST was performed according to the following criteria as described by Sabroe et al. [24]:
mild = 1-10 small (<3 cm in diameter), moderate =
10-50 small weals or 1-10 large weals, and severe = >50
small weals or >10 large weals.

Patients with respiratory diseases

Patients with respiratory diseases were also included in the
study as a comparison group. With this aim, patients with
asthma and SAR were included. Persistent asthma patients
were diagnosed according to the definition of the American
Thoracic Society [1]. Patients were included if they had
documented asthma symptoms for at least one year. Atopy
was defined by relevent medical history with positive skin
prick test response to common aeroallergens. Forty asthmatics (30 women and 10 men, mean age: 45.3 + 8.9
years) were non-atopics and 30 asthmatics (21 women and
9 men, mean age: 41.7 + 10.3 years) were atopics
according to their medical history and skin prick test
results. Atopic asthmatics with sensitization to perennial
allergens were included in the study. We selected newly
diagnosed asthma patients without previous use of asthma
medication (inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting bronchodialators, leukotriene modifiers) or previously diagnosed
asthmatics that were not using using asthma medication for
at least 1 month before the inclusion period except short
acting beta 2 agonists. Asthma severity was assessed
according to GINA report as mild persistent, moderate
persistent and severe persistent [20]. We did not include
intermittent asthmatics in the present study.

SAR patients had documented historical data defined by
nasal itching, rhinorhea, sneezing, and nasal obstruction for
at least 2 years prior to the study. The diagnosis of SAR
was made on the basis of history and sensitization to pollen
allergens with skin prick test (SPT). Patients with skin tests
positive to mix of grasses, weeds and tree pollens correlated to the patient’s seasonal history were included in the
study. Allergic rhinitis patients with perennial allergen
sensitization were not included. SAR patients investigated
out of pollen season between November and March.

All patients and healthy controls denied a previous
diagnosis of cancer, autoimmune disease or infectious
disease within the previous | month. The study approved
by the local ethics committee and all subjects gave written
informed consent.

 

 

Skin prick test

Skin prick tests (SPTs) were performed by using a common
panel including Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, grass, tree and weed pollens, animal
dander (cat, dog), animal feathers and molds (including
Alternaria, Cladosporium, Aspergillus, Penicillium) allergen extracts (ALK, Spain). Positive and negative controls
were histamine and phenolated glycerol saline, respectively. A mean wheal diameter of 3 mm or greater than that
of obtained with control solution was considered as
positive.

Autologous serum skin test (ASST)

Venous blood was collected in a sterile glass tubes and
allowed to clot at room pemperature for 30 min. Serum
was separated by centrifugation at 500 g for 15 min. 50 pl
autologous serum was injected intradermally into the
patients forearm to perform ASST. Epidermal histamine
0.01 mg/ml and intradermal 0.9% sterile saline were used
as positive and negative controls, respectively. The diameter of a wheal was calculated as the mean of the two
longest perpendicular wheal diameters. ASST was considered positive when a serum-induced wheal had a
diameter 3 mm greater than that of negative control surrounded by erythema at 30 min. We considered red or pink
oedema as a positive response.

Serum IL-18

Blood samples were obtained from all patients and controls
after an overnight fast by venipuncture. Samples were
centrifuged at 2,500g for 15 min in order to separate serum
and stored at —80°C until analysis. IL-18 levels in these
serum samples were measured using a commercially
available ELISA (Bendermed Systems, Vienna, Austria).
The samples were processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The lower limit of detection of the
IL-18 assay was 9.2 pg/ml. The intra- and interassay
coefficients of variation of the assay were 6.5 and 8.1%,
respectively.

Study design

Clinical and demographic data were obtained using a
standardized interview form. A complete physical examination was performed at the first study visit. All subjects
underwent a laboratory examination including complete
blood count, blood glucose, cholesterol, urea nitrogene
and creatinine levels, liver and kidney function tests,
thyroid function tests, antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid
factor and anti-thyroid antibodies (anti-thyroglobulin,
anti-TPO and anti-TSH receptor antibody). ASST and
SPTs were applied to all subjects after the first examination. None of the patients was taking anti-leukotriens,
immunosuppressive drugs and systemic corticosteroids
within at least 1 week period before the investigation.
Second generation antihistamines were stopped 5 days
and first generation antihistamines were stopped 3 days
before skin tests. Chronic systemic disease was defined as
any other chronic organic diseases (such as diabetes,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia) other than urticaria,
asthma and rhinitis and those diseases which are not
mentionned in exclusion criteria.

Statistical analysis

 

Values are expressed as mean + SD (standard deviation).
Chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare
categorical variables between groups. The Student’s rf test
was used to compare ages between groups. Multiple
comparisons were made between groups using Anova test
and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Mann—Whitney U test was used
to compare parameters between groups. Assay performance was computed using sensitivity and specificity.
Sensitivity is the percentage of positive ASST response in
the patients. Specificity is the percentage of negative ASST
response in subjects without the disease.

Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the
independent association between the diagnosis of CSU
(reference respiratory diseases), serum IL-18 levels and the
presence of ASST for all patients. The strength of the
relationship between covariates and ASST was evaluated
by calculating odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence
interval (CI) for all the factors tested. Variables included in
the multivariable logistic regression model were selected
based on a significance test of less than 0.05 in univariate
analysis. Age and IL-18 levels were analysed as continuous
covariates. All other variables were coded as dichotomous
categorical covariates. Differences were considered as
statistically significant if P < 0.05. The data were analyzed
with SPSS computer program for Windows version 13.0.

Results

The mean age of the patients in each group was not
different from normal-controls (P > 0.05). Duration of
disease, total IgE levels, ASST response and serum IL-18
levels in each group are presented in Table 1.

All patients with CSU and respiratory diseases

The numbers of patients who had positive response to
ASST were higher in all patients when compared with
normal controls (29/146 vs. 0/20, ad = 8.24, P = 0.026).
Positive response to ASST in atopic and non-atopic subjects were not different (14/68 vs. 15/78, a = 0.04,
P = 0.84).

Duration of the disease was not different between
patients with positive and negative response to ASST
(6.7 + 6.4 vs. 6.4 + 5.9 years, P = 0.81). Fifteen patients
had doctor-diagnosed hypertension and seven patients had
doctor-diagnosed type Il diabetes mellitus. We detected
autoimmune thyroid disease in 10 patients, iron deficiency
anemia in 9 patients and hypercholesterolemia in 6 patients
as a result of laboratory investigation. The frequency of
positive response to ASST was not different between those

CSU versus respiratory diseases

Table 2 shows comparisons of atopy, thyroid autoantibodies, systemic diseases, response to ASST and serum
IL-18 levels between patients with CSU and respiratory
diseases. The frequency of thyroid autoimmunity (6/55 vs.
4/91, v = 2.19, P = 0.18) and other chronic systemic
diseases (22/55 vs. 24/91, f= 2.91, P=0.10) were
similar between those patients with CSU and respiratory
diseases. Atopy was increased in respiratory diseases
patients (vy? = 8.87, P = 0.004). Positive response to
ASST (7 = 46, P = 0.034) and serum IL-18 levels
(P = 0.002) were higher in CSU patients when compared
with those with respiratory diseases.

Sensitivity of ASST was 29.1% for CSU and 14.3% for
respiratory diseases. Specificity of the test was 100% for
each of the diseases. If we take a cut-off threshold of
1.5 mm for a positive ASST response then sensitivity
increases to 34.5% in CU and to 20.9% in respiratory
diseases. Specificity was 90% at this threshold. If we take

6 mm cut-off threshold, then sensitivity becomes 18.2 and
11.0%, respectively in CU and respiratory diseases. The
specificity was 100% at this threshold also. Sensitivity for
respiratory diseases was less than that of CU at all
threshold levels.

Patients with CSU

The numbers of patients who had positive response to
ASST were higher in CSU patients when compared with
normal controls Cm = 11.4, P = 0.004). Seventeen of
CSU patients were atopic. The frequency of positive ASST
response was not statistically different between atopics and
non-atopics in CSU (6/17 vs. 10/38, 7 = 0.45, P = 0.53).
The frequency of ASST positivity was not statistically
different between those patients with and without thyroid
autoantibodies (3/6 vs. 13/49, ¢ = 1.31, P = 0.34) and
any systemic disease (9/22 vs. 7/33, y° = 2.45, P = 0.14)
in CSU patients. CSU patients had higher serum IL-18
levels than normal controls (Table 1) (P = 0.031). Serum
IL-18 levels were not different in those CSU patients with
or without positive ASST response (295.5 + 203.7 vs.
276.5 + 94.7 pg/ml, P = 0.67).

Twenty-seven of CSU patients were classified as mild,
21 were moderate and 7 were severe. Four of 16 CSU
patients with positive response to ASST had severe disease,
8 of them moderate and 4 had mild urticaria. Positive
response to ASST was determined more frequently in
severe and moderate urticaria patients (42.8%) than those
with mild disease (14.8%) (P = 0.037). Although serum

Patients with respiratory diseases

Positive respone to ASST was not statistically different in
respiratory patients from that in controls (13/91 vs. 0/20,
7 = 5.53, P = 0.12). The frequency of positive ASST
response was not different between atopics and non-atopics
(8/51 vs. 5/40, 7° = 0.18, P = 0.77). The frequency of
ASST positivity was not different between those patients
with and without thyroid autoantibodies (0/4 vs. 13/87,
ras = 1.26, P = 1.00) and any systemic disease (3/24 vs.
10/67, ¢ = 0.09, P = 1.00). Serum IL-18 levels were not
different in non-atopic asthma, atopic asthma and SAR
patients from normal-controls (P > 0.05).

Asthmatic patients

Forty-three of patients were classified as mild, 20 were
moderate and 7 were severe. Four of 10 asthmatic patients
with positive response to ASST were severe persistent
asthmatics, 5 of were moderate persistent and 1 was mild
persistent. Positive response to ASST was more frequent in
severe and moderate asthma patients (33.3%) than those
with mild disease (2.3%) (P = 0.001). Serum IL-18 levels
were not different between severe (395.5 + 284.7 pg/ml),
moderate (196.7 + 198.1 pg/ml) and mild asthmatics
(227.3 + 236.8 pg/ml) (P > 0.05). Duration of disease
was not different between those asthmatics with positive
and negative ASST response (7.6 + 4.1 vs. 7.5 + 4.3
years, P = 0.99).

 

 

 

 

 

Multivariate analysis for the association of ASST

Table 3 shows the multivariate logistic regression analysis
in all patients. Positive response to ASST was significantly
associated with diagnosis of CSU (OR: 3.13, 95% CI:
1.25-7.87) and with female gender (OR: 3.98, 95% Ck
1.19-13.38). However, serum IL-18 level was not

647

associated with positive ASST response (OR: 1.00, 95%
CI: 0.99-1.00).

Discussion

We showed that the positive response to ASST is higher in
all the patients with CU and respiratory diseases supporting
the presence of the functional autoantibodies against to
FceRI or IgE. ASST reactivity was associated with disease
severity in CSU and asthmatic patients. Our findings also
strengthened the role of autoimmunity in CU patients
having higher levels of serum IL-18. However, multivariable analysis of the present study showed that ASST
response was associated mainly with diagnosis of CU and
female gender.

Positive response to ASST, a condition that is associated
with circulatory autoantibodies against to FceRI or IgE, has
been shown to be related with increased release of histamine in vitro [3]. Although the clinical utility is not well
known, ASST is recommended to diagnose autoreactivity
in CU patients. It seems to be a rare phenomenon in healthy
population similar to our study [23, 26]. Our results confirmed that ASST is not sensitive enough to use as a
screening test for all patients with CU, however, it has
specificity as a 100%. In the present study, comparisons in
“Results” for different threshold levels of ASST response
suggested us that in turn there may not be difference in the
pathogenesis of the ASST between urticaria and respiratory
diseases. We took a wheal diameter of 3 mm larger than a
negative normal saline control with surrounding erytema as
in some previous studies [5—7]. Widely used 1.5 mm cutoff threshold for positive ASST response was generally
adopted in order to define the statistical performance
characteristics of this test with respect to in vitro serum
basophil histamine release activity in urticaria patients. As
stated by Konstantionu and Grattan [18] use of this 1.5 mm
threshold in any other group of patients is not certain.
According to our results the use of 3 mm cut-off point
seems to be reasonable to compare ASST response in
different subject groups. We recommend the use of this
criteria to overcome a possible non-inflammatory oedema
response also. Some authors have stated that false positive
ASST response might occur as a result of generation of
factors such as bradykinin and C5a [18]. One might think

that chronic-systemic diseases cause false positive ASTT
responses through the release of some inflammatory
mediators and activation of complemant factors. The result
of the present study showing that the patients with systemic
diseases had no increased response to ASST in all as well
as in CU patients did not support the possibility of false
positive response.

The role of autoreactivity is not certain in the diseases.
Autoantibodies against FceRI or IgE have been implicated
in the pathogenesis of asthma irrespective of atopic status
[14]. Our study confirmed that the increased response to
ASST in CU and respiratory diseases occurs irrespective of
their atopic status. However, frequency of positive
response to ASST was related with disease severity in CU
and asthma suggesting autoantibodies against FceRI or IgE
might be related with disease activity.

Autoimmunity has been regarded in the pathogenesis
of CU and some autoimmune diseases including thyroid
autoimmune diseases that are associated with positive
response to ASST [4]. We found positive thyroid autoantibody response in 10 patients including 6 CU patients.
There was no statistical difference in regard to presence
of anti-thyroid antibodies between those patients with CU
and respiratory diseases. In addition, the presence of
thyroid autoantibodies or any other chronic systemic
disease might affect the occurrence of ASST response
through their inflammatory actions. However, we did not
find an increased ASST response in the patients with
thyroid autoantibodies supporting the contention that
these similar autoimmune events may mark susceptibility
to autoimmunity [21]. In the present study, chronic systemic diseases alone were not associated with positive
ASST response.

IL-18 may play a role in autoimmune regulatory activity
[17, 29]. IL-18 is produced by monocytes/macrophages and
IL-18 receptor is expressed on variety of cells including
ThI cells, naive T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells, endothelial and smooth
muscle cells [8]. Thus, IL-18 activity appears to exert a
variety of immunological effects. It is well known that Th1
and Th17 type responses have a pathogenic role in autoimmunity [8]. IL-18 exerts a Thl type response with costimulation of IL-2, IL-12 and IL-15 whereas it shows a Th
17 response with co-stimulation of IL-23 [8]. IL-18 is able
to generate Th2 responses under certain conditions and
promote allergic inflammation through the stimulation of
IL-4, IL-13 and histamine release [13]. We found that
ASST was associated with serum IL-18 levels in univariate
analysis of all patients suggesting a possible role of IL-18
on ASST response regardless of the underlying disease.
However, we did not find any association in multivariate
analysis. In addition, CSU patients had higher levels of IL18 than normal controls. Higher IL-18 levels in CU patients

may be explained by clinical severity of the disease which
could affect serum IL-18 levels as reported in a previous
study [27]. Although we found higher serum IL-18 levels
in severe disease in CU as well as asthma patients it did not
reach statistical significance. Our multiple logistic regression analysis showed that positive response to ASST was
not associated with serum IL-18 levels (OR: 1.00, 95% CI:
0.99-1.00). However, the diagnosis of CSU (OR: 3.13,
95% CI: 1.25-7.87) and female gender (OR: 3.98, 95% Cl:
1.19-13.38) were associated with positive ASST response.
Our results showing that female gender was found an
associated risk factor for ASST reactivity confirmed results
in a previous study [19]. The association of autoimmune
diseases with female gender is well described; sex hormones have been implicated in this association [10]. Our
results showed that women are more likely to develop
autoreactivity that can be assessed by ASST.

Antihistamine use may affect the skin test response. We
included only those CSU patients in whom antihistamines
could stop enough time to perform skin tests to prevent
false negative results. The limitation of the study is that the
results do not extend to those subjects who could not stop
antihistamine therapies.

In conclusion, we found that positive response to ASST
is associated with CSU and female gender. IL-18, although
increased in CSU patients, does not seem to be associated
with positive response to ASST. CSU and asthmatic
patients showed increased ASTT response when their
diseases are more severe. Whether this positive ASST
response which is more prominent in CSU is involved in
the pathogenesis of the diseases is a matter of debate.
Pathogenesis of wheal response may be in part mediated by
functional antibodies causing histamine release from mast
cells in CU. Considering that it is also found in patients
with asthma related with disease severity, it could be a
result of inflammatory events such as antigen binding of
specific IgE or direct vasoactive factors (thrombin and
kinins) during the diseases’ process.
