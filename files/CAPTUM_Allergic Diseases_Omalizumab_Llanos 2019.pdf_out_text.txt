Purpose: Patients with severe asthma are eligible for asthma-specific biologics as add-on
therapies, such as mepolizumab and omalizumab, when optimized controller therapies are
unable to control their symptoms. However, few real-world data are available to describe the
characteristics and associated economic burden of patients considered to be candidates for
mepolizumab or omalizumab therapy.
Methods: This retrospective cohort study investigated patients with asthma (212 years of
age) identified at the time of first mepolizumab or omalizumab administration (index date)
in the MarketScan™ Commercial Database. Data were collected during the 12-month period
before the index date (baseline period) for two mutually exclusive patient groups (patients
prescribed mepolizumab and omalizumab, respectively). Baseline demographics, history of
exacerbations, healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), and medical costs were investigated.

 

 

Results: In total, 413 and 1,834 patients who had been prescribed mepolizumab or omalizumab,
respectively, were identified. During the baseline period, patients prescribed mepolizumab
experienced more exacerbations (81.4% vs 57.5%, P<0.001), had higher asthma-related
HCRU for outpatient services (all P<0.01), and had higher total asthma-related healthcare costs
(US$11,000 vs US$7,400, P<0.001) compared with patients prescribed omalizumab. Allergic
rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and chronic idiopathic urticaria were more common among patients

 

 

prescribed omalizumab vs mepolizumab. In contrast, sinusitis, nasal polyps, and comorbid
COPD were more common among patients prescribed mepolizumab vs omalizumab. Prescriptions of fixed-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) with long-acting B,-agonists (LABAs) and
ICS/LABA/long-acting muscarinic antagonist triple therapy during the baseline period were
higher among patients prescribed mepolizumab vs omalizumab (80.4% vs 56.8% and 27.1% vs
14.4%, respectively, both P<0.001).

Conclusion: In the 12 months prior to initiation of asthma-specific biologics, patients prescribed
mepolizumab had a different prevalence of certain comorbidities, higher disease burden, higher

 

HCRU, and higher healthcare costs compared with patients prescribed omalizumab.
Keywords: asthma, mepolizumab, biologic, healthcare resource utilization, healthcare costs

 

Plain language summary

Why was the study done? When patients with severe asthma are unable to control their
symptoms with optimized controller therapies, such as inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), they are
eligible for additional treatment with asthma-specific biologic therapies, such as mepolizumab

or omalizumab. However, few data are available to describe the
disease symptoms and associated healthcare costs of patients eligible
for mepolizumab or omalizumab before they start either therapy.
What did the researchers do and find? This study used data
from the US MarketScan™ Commercial Database to investigate
patients with asthma who were prescribed mepolizumab (Nucala®;
GlaxoSmithKline LLC, The Navy Yard, PA, USA) or omalizumab
(Xolair®; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ, USA; Genentech Inc, South San Francisco, CA, USA) as an add-on therapy.
Patients’ baseline characteristics, frequency of asthma attacks,
healthcare utilization, and medical costs were analyzed for the
12-month period before they started treatment with mepolizumab
or omalizumab.

Patients prescribed mepolizumab experienced more asthma
attacks, had higher asthma-related healthcare utilization for outpatient services, and higher total asthma-related healthcare costs
compared with patients prescribed omalizumab. Allergic rhinitis
(allergies/hay fever) was more commonly seen in patients prescribed
omalizumab compared with mepolizumab, while administration of

medications such as fixed-dose ICSs and long-acting B,-agonists

 

was higher in the patients prescribed mepolizumab vs omalizumab.
What do these results mean? Although these findings are

reflective of the US Food and Drug Administration approved

 

indications of these therapies, they also suggest that physicians
may preferentially prescribe mepolizumab over omalizumab for
more severe and difficult-to-treat asthma cases rather than across
the full spectrum of eligible patients who could benefit from
mepolizumab therapy.

Introduction

Poor asthma control leads to heightened medical expenses,
due to increased asthma-related emergency room (ER) visits
and inpatient admissions, and lost productivity.'? In 2014,
the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project estimated that
1.9 million ER visits and >300,000 hospitalizations in the
US were related to asthma.*

Asthma severity is determined by the level of treatment
needed to control symptoms and exacerbations in both the
Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) and European Respiratory Society and American Thoracic Society guidelines.**
Moderate asthma is defined as being well controlled with
a low-dose ICS combined with a long-acting B,-agonist
(LABA),* whereas severe asthma is defined as requiring
treatment with high-dose ICS plus a second controller and/
or systemic corticosteroids.>

Asthma is a heterogeneous condition with multiple
phenotypes, including eosinophilic asthma and allergic
asthma.** Guidelines recognize that asthma phenotypes
may guide the use of add-on therapies when symptoms
persist despite optimized treatment with controller medi
cations.*° However, a notable minority of patients meet
criteria for more than one asthma phenotype,’ and presently there are no guidelines on treatment strategies for
these patients.*

Mepolizumab and omalizumab are two add-on therapies used to treat severe asthma. Mepolizumab is an IL-5
inhibitor indicated for the add-on maintenance treatment of
severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype (patients 212
years) and for the treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis
with polyangiitis (patients 218 years).’? Omalizumab is an
IgE inhibitor indicated for the treatment of moderate-tosevere asthma inadequately controlled with ICS with signs

 

of allergy (patients 26 years), and for H1 antihistaminerefractory chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU; patients 2=12
years).’ Both have well-established efficacy in asthma*?
and have been shown to reduce asthma exacerbations, ER
visits and hospitalizations, and improve health-related
quality of life (HRQoL) compared with current standard of
care.” '© However, the asthma populations included in clinical
trials with mepolizumab and omalizumab differed. Patients
in the mepolizumab trials had asthma with a history of 22
exacerbations in the previous year despite regular use of
high-dose ICS plus additional controller(s) with or without
oral corticosteroids (OCSs), and a blood eosinophil count
of either 2150 cells/pL at screening or 2300 cells/uL within
12 months of enrollment. In the omalizumab trials, patients
had moderate to severe persistent asthma for 212 months
and a positive skin test reaction to a perennial aeroallergen.
As such, the comparative efficacy of mepolizumab and
omalizumab is unclear, and no head-to-head comparisons
have been conducted to date. Indirect comparisons using
network meta-analyses have indicated broadly similar
efficacy and safety profiles in patients with severe asthma,
although population differences and high rates of outcome
heterogeneity precluded any definitive conclusions.!”'§
More recently, a single-arm study showed that patients not
optimally controlled with omalizumab who were switched
directly to mepolizumab and followed for 32 weeks achieved
clinically meaningful improvements from baseline in exacerbation rates, asthma control, HRQoL, and lung function,
with no new safety issues identified.!°°

Currently, there are a lack of definitive guidelines
for selecting between mepolizumab and omalizumab in
patients eligible for both treatments. As such, real-world
data on patients’ characteristics, burden of disease, and
healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) prior to being prescribed mepolizumab or omalizumab would be valuable for
improving understanding of current treatment patterns and

the clinical events driving prescription of these therapies.
Using real-world data derived from a large, geographically diverse employer medical claims database, this study
aimed to describe the baseline demographic and clinical
characteristics, as well as HCRU and costs, in patients with
asthma during a 12-month period prior to being prescribed
mepolizumab or omalizumab.

Methods
Study design

This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with asthma
with commercial insurance coverage identified from a US
administrative insurance database (MarketScan™ Commercial
Claims and Encounters Database; Truven Health Analytics,
Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The database contains the healthcare
experience of privately insured individuals covered under
a variety of fee-for-service, fully capitated, and partially
capitated health plans. Data are contributed by employers
and health plan organizations. Further information on this
database can be found in the supplementary materials.

Patients were identified between November 1, 2015 and
March 31, 2017 (patient identification period) at the time of
first mepolizumab or omalizumab administration (index date).
Data were examined for each patient during the 12 months
prior to, and including, the index date (baseline period);
exacerbation rates were also examined for the 3-month period
immediately prior to index. Patient assignment to treatment
groups is described in the supplementary materials.

All database records were fully de-identified and fully
compliant with US patient confidentiality requirements,
including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act of 1996. As patients could not be identified, no patient
consent was required.

Patients

Eligible patients were 212 years of age with a medical or
pharmacy claim with a Healthcare Common Procedure
Coding System (HCPCS) or National Drug Code (NDC)
indicating first administration of mepolizumab (HCPCS:
C9473, J2182; NDC: 00173-0881-01) or omalizumab
(HCPCS: J2357; NDC: 50242-0040-62, 50242-0040-01)
during the patient identification period. HCPCS is a standardized coding system used to describe specific healthcare
procedures or services provided; NDCs are universal product
identifiers for human drugs in the US. Eligible patients also
had 12 months of continuous enrollment with medical and
pharmacy benefits prior to and including the date of the

first administration of mepolizumab or omalizumab (index
date). Details on the exclusions of patients are shown in the
supplementary materials.

End points and assessments

Demographics were reported at the index date. End points
were assessed for two different periods: the baseline period
(12 months prior to and including the index date) and the
3-month period immediately prior to the index date. End
points in the baseline period included: comorbid conditions,
treatment history, any asthma exacerbation and asthma
exacerbation requiring hospitalization, all-cause and asthmarelated HCRU, and all-cause and asthma-related costs. In
addition, exacerbation rates were assessed for the 3-month
period immediately prior to the index date.

Comorbid conditions were identified using diagnosis
codes present on medical claims during the baseline period;
patients were required to have at least one nondiagnostic
medical claim with the diagnosis (ICD—9/ICD-10 codes)
during the baseline period.

Exacerbations were defined as requiring |) an outpatient
or ER visit with asthma diagnosis recorded in any position
on the claim and at least one dispensing of systemic corticosteroids (oral, intravenous, or intramuscular) within 7
days before or after the encounter or 2) hospitalization with
asthma as a primary diagnosis. Exacerbations requiring hospitalization were defined as those requiring hospitalization
with asthma as a primary diagnosis. Exacerbations within
14 days of each other were considered a single exacerbation.

HCRU included inpatient services, outpatient services, and
pharmacy services. Inpatient services were based on the presence of insurance claims occurring in an inpatient setting during
a hospitalization. All services administered during the hospital
stay are included. Outpatient services included encounters
and claims for services rendered in a doctor’s office, hospital
outpatient facility, ER, or other outpatient facility (eg, radiology services, laboratory tests, outpatient infusion). Outpatient
pharmacy services were identified by prescription claims.

All-cause and asthma-related costs were based on medical costs associated with inpatient services (including claims
associated with the admission such as hospital claims, physician claims, surgeon claims, and claims from independent
laboratories), outpatient services, and outpatient pharmacy
services. All costs were adjusted for inflation using the
Consumer Price Index and standardized to 2016 US dollars.
Further details of asthma-related and all-cause costs can be
found in the supplementary materials.

Statistical analysis

All study variables were analyzed descriptively, stratified by treatment group and presented as percentages
for categorial variables and mean (SD) or median for
continuous variables. Statistical comparisons of mepolizumab vs omalizumab were provided using appropriate
tests based on the distribution of the measure (Student’s
t-test, Mann—Whitney U test, or chi-squared test), with
statistical significance evaluated at the o=0.05 level. All
statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

Ethics approval and informed
consent

This study utilized de-identified retrospective claims data,
and as such, this study did not require institutional review
board review and approval or informed consent.

Results

Patient population and demographics

A total of 413 and 1,834 patients were included in the patients
prescribed mepolizumab and omalizumab, respectively
(Figure 1). Patient demographics at the index date are shown
in Table 1. Compared with patients prescribed omalizumab,
patients prescribed mepolizumab were slightly older, with a
greater proportion of patients 255 years, and more likely to
have an index year that was later in the patient identification
period (both P<0.001). No significant differences were found
between patients prescribed mepolizumab or omalizumab for
type of commercial insurance (P=0.174).

treatment cohorts (Table 2). The occurrence of respiratory

infections was similar in both groups (P=0.784). Compared
with patients prescribed omalizumab, patients prescribed

mepolizumab had significantly lower prevalence of allergic

rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and CIU (all PS0.002). However, a
significantly higher proportion of patients prescribed mepolizumab vs omalizumab had sinusitis, COPD, nasal polyps,

The most common asthma treatments (used by >50% of
patients) in both cohorts were OCS for acute and chronic use,
short-acting B,-agonists (SABA), fixed-dose combinations
of ICS with a LABA, and leukotriene receptor antagonists
(Table 2). The number of patients prescribed immunosuppressive therapies in the 12-month baseline period was ~1%
among patients prescribed mepolizumab and omalizumab
(supplementary materials).

Asthma exacerbations during the baseline
periods

During the 3-month and 12-month baseline periods, significantly more patients that were prescribed mepolizumab had
any exacerbation compared with those prescribed omalizumab (both P<0.001) (Figure 2A, B). The proportion of
patients who experienced exacerbations requiring hospitalization was numerically higher in the mepolizumab group
vs the patients prescribed omalizumab at 3 months and 12
months, but the differences were not statistically significant
(P=0.505 and P=0.121, respectively).

 

HCRU and expenditure during the
12-month baseline period
A high proportion of patients in both groups (>86%) had an
asthma-related outpatient office visit or pharmacy prescription
during the 12-month baseline period; however, these services
were accessed by a significantly higher proportion of patients
receiving mepolizumab compared with omalizumab (Figure
3). A comparable proportion of patients in both groups experienced an asthma-related inpatient admission or an asthmarelated ER visit (Figure 3). Similar patterns were observed
regarding the mean number of services accessed (Table 3).
A similar proportion of patients in both groups (>98%)
had an all-cause outpatient visit or pharmacy prescription
during the 12-month baseline period (Figure S1). However,
the mean number of all-cause outpatient office visits and
pharmacy prescriptions was significantly higher in patients
who were subsequently prescribed mepolizumab (Table S1).
All-cause inpatient admissions were seen in a significantly
higher proportion of patients prescribed mepolizumab, and
these patients also had a significantly longer inpatient stay

vs patients subsequently prescribed omalizumab (Figure S1
and Table S1). The proportion of patients with 21 all-cause
ER visit was significantly higher in the patients prescribed
omalizumab (43.1% vs 37.0%; P=0.025); however, the mean
number of ER visits per patient was significantly higher in the
patients prescribed mepolizumab (Figure S1 and Table S1).

The mean total asthma-related healthcare costs incurred
during the baseline period were significantly higher among
patients prescribed mepolizumab (US$11,000) compared
with patients prescribed omalizumab (US$7,400, P<0.001)
(Figure 4A). The cost categories that were significantly higher
for patients prescribed mepolizumab vs omalizumab included
outpatient costs (US$6,295 vs US$4,114, P=0.002) and outpatient pharmacy costs (US$3,044 vs US$1,909, P<0.001).
Outpatient costs for office visits and other outpatient services
were both significantly higher in the patients prescribed

mepolizumab vs omalizumab (both P<0.005). ER visit costs
were comparable between the two groups.

Similar to the asthma-related healthcare costs, all-cause
healthcare costs during the 12-month baseline period were
significantly higher for patients prescribed mepolizumab
compared with the omalizumab, including total healthcare
costs (US$34,825 vs US$25,559, P<0.001), outpatient costs
(US$18,690 vs US$14,660, P=0.020), and outpatient pharmacy costs (US$8,719 vs US$5,754, P<0.001) (Figure 4B).

We also conducted a sensitivity analysis in which patients
who had received omalizumab or mepolizumab during the
baseline period were included. Patient demographics, clinical
characteristics, asthma exacerbations, and HCRU were generally consistent with the main analysis (Figures S2 and S3
and Tables S2—S4). Although total asthma-related healthcare
costs were significantly higher among patients prescribed

Figure 4 Asthma-related (A) and total (B) healthcare expenditure during the |2-month baseline period.

omalizumab compared with patients prescribed mepolizumab
(Figure S4), this likely reflects the fact that there was a greater
proportion of patients with prior omalizumab use in the omalizumab group (who would have corresponding pharmacy costs
for biologic therapy) than the mepolizumab group.

Discussion

This study described the baseline characteristics, disease
burden, and HCRU of patients with asthma in the 12 months
prior to initiation of mepolizumab or omalizumab in a realworld setting. Overall, disease burden and HCRU in the
prior year were higher for patients who were subsequently

prescribed mepolizumab compared with those subsequently
prescribed omalizumab. These patterns were also seen in
healthcare expenditures; patients subsequently prescribed
mepolizumab had both greater asthma-related and all-cause
healthcare expenditures than those subsequently prescribed
omalizumab.

The differences observed between patients prescribed
mepolizumab or omalizumab reflect the US Food and
Drug Administration approved indications of the two
asthma-specific biologics.4*’* This difference was also
reflected in the extent of asthma medications prescribed
in the 12 months prior to mepolizumab or omalizumab

prescription. For example, a higher proportion of patients
subsequently prescribed mepolizumab vs omalizumab were
prescribed ICS-based therapy in the prior year, although it
should be noted that no information on relative dose levels
was collected. Additionally, HCRU and costs in the previous
year were much higher for patients prescribed mepolizumab
than omalizumab. This is likely due to higher numbers of
patients with uncontrolled severe asthma who experienced
exacerbations in the mepolizumab vs omalizumab cohort
(81.4% vs 57.5%, respectively). The relationship between
healthcare costs, exacerbations, and asthma control was
previously described in a UK and US database study, which

 

reported that the mean asthma-related healthcare cost per
exacerbation in patients with severe uncontrolled asthma was
almost double that found in patients without severe uncontrolled asthma (US$911 vs US$486).7! Another explanation
for the lower burden of disease among patients subsequently
prescribed omalizumab could be that ~20% of these patients
had comorbid CIU. As such, these patients may have had
milder asthma, requiring lower levels of ICS maintenance
therapy, and lower HCRU and costs.

Drivers for prescription of mepolizumab or omalizumab
to patients with severe asthma include exacerbation risk
reduction and OCS dose sparing. Randomized controlled
trials have demonstrated reductions in exacerbation rates
with mepolizumab*"” or omalizumab,'?"“ and a reduction
in maintenance OCS dose with mepolizumab, in patients
with asthma.'? An observational study and a pooled analysis
of two randomized controlled trials also suggested an OCS
dose-sparing effect with omalizumab.” In the current study,
a notable proportion of patients prescribed mepolizumab or
omalizumab had not experienced an exacerbation in the 12
months (19% and 46% of patients, respectively) or 3 months
(49% and 65% of patients, respectively) prior to prescription.
Add-on therapy use may be influenced by factors other than
exacerbation risk, such as OCS sparing effect or, for patients
prescribed omalizumab, CIU diagnosis. Moreover, treatment
decisions may have been influenced by additional clinical
information that may not be reflected in the claims database.
While OCS treatment can be useful when patients fail to
respond to controller medications,** there is the potential for
debilitating side effects with chronic use.* A previous realworld study of asthma-specific biologic therapy eligibility
in patients with severe asthma showed that mepolizumaband omalizumab-eligible populations have broadly similar
demographics but did report more frequent maintenance OCS
use in mepolizumab-eligible patients.** However, the relative
proportion of patients receiving maintenance vs short-term
OCS in this study were not recorded.

GINA guidelines recommend add-on therapies for
asthma that is uncontrolled on step 4 treatment, which
includes moderate- to high-dose ICS/LABA maintenance
treatment, medium-dose ICS/formoterol as maintenance
and reliever, and high-dose ICS plus a second controller.
Anti-IL-5 add-on therapies (eg, mepolizumab) are recommended for severe eosinophilic asthma that is uncontrolled
despite step 4 treatment, whereas omalizumab add-on
therapy is recommended for uncontrolled severe allergic
asthma with elevated IgE levels.‘ Based on these guidelines,
physicians treating patients who remain uncontrolled on
step 4 treatment may select omalizumab for patients with
an allergic phenotype and mepolizumab for those with an
eosinophilic phenotype. In the current study, comorbid
conditions associated with upper respiratory eosinophil
involvement (nasal polyps and sinusitis*>?°) as well as
other respiratory conditions (COPD) were more frequent
in the patients prescribed mepolizumab than omalizumab.
In contrast, allergic conditions (allergic rhinitis, atopic
dermatitis, and CIU) were more frequent in the patients
prescribed omalizumab. These data suggest that the
distinct GINA guidelines for severe allergic and severe
eosinophilic asthma phenotypes did influence prescription
patterns of add-on therapy. However, evidence from realworld settings shows that eosinophilic and allergic asthma
phenotypes are overlapping rather than discrete conditions,
and that a considerable proportion of patients with severe
asthma (~37%) are eligible for both mepolizumab and
omalizumab.* Similarly, a post hoc analysis of the Phase
III MENSA and MUSCA studies, which assessed the effect
of subcutaneous mepolizumab 100 mg plus standard of
care in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, found
that 27% of 936 patients included in the analysis were also
eligible for omalizumab therapy according to US prescribing criteria.?” Addition of mepolizumab was also associated
with improvements vs placebo in asthma control, HRQoL
and OCS use irrespective of prior omalizumab use.** More
recently, a prospective, single-arm study confirmed that
patients who are suboptimally controlled on omalizumab
and who switch directly to mepolizumab add-on treatment
can achieve significant improvement in exacerbation rates,
lung function, health status, and asthma control, with 77%
of patients experiencing the minimal clinically important
difference of 20.5-point reduction in Asthma Control
Questionnaire-5 score.'°° Together, these data suggest that
mepolizumab could be a suitable option for those patients
who exhibit severe uncontrolled asthma with both allergic
and eosinophilic phenotype markers and are, therefore,
eligible for both mepolizumab and omalizumab.

Limitations of this study include: first, data do not represent the entire US population, given that these data were
obtained from patients with commercial insurance in the
US and no patients insured through Medicare and Medicaid
were included. Second, during the 12-month baseline period,
the asthma severity classification of each patient was not
defined, making it difficult to determine if eligibility requirements of each asthma-specific biologic were being correctly
followed. Third, the US approval of omalizumab for severe
asthma in 2003” precedes the approval of mepolizumab*”
by 12 years, meaning that physicians have additional years
of prescribing experience with omalizumab, which could
influence prescribing habits. Fourth, some patients may not
have been receiving optimized controller therapy, which may
have impacted on asthma control and subsequent HCRU and
costs. Alternatively, the nature of the study design and data
availability may also have impacted this output. Fifth, data
on asthma-related exacerbations, HCRU, and costs may have
been influenced by nonasthma diagnoses also included on the
claim. Finally, among patients prescribed omalizumab, 21.2%
had comorbid CIU, which is also indicated for omalizumab
treatment. It is possible that some of these patients had milder
asthma, which would not warrant omalizumab treatment in
the absence of the CIU diagnosis. This would have resulted
in a lower burden of disease and thereby lower HCRU and
healthcare costs in this cohort compared with the mepolizumab cohort. In contrast, 15.3% of patients prescribed
mepolizumab had features of hypereosinophilic syndrome,
which may have been associated with more severe disease,
higher HCRU, and higher healthcare costs.

Conclusion

The results of this real-world US study show that, in the 12
months prior to prescription, patients who were subsequently
prescribed mepolizumab had a greater disease burden than
those subsequently prescribed omalizumab. Patients prescribed mepolizumab also had significantly greater prior
asthma-related HCRU and healthcare costs compared with
those prescribed omalizumab. These results suggest that physicians may currently preferentially prescribe mepolizumab
in more refractory cases of severe eosinophilic asthma, rather
than across the full spectrum of eligible patients who could
benefit from mepolizumab therapy. In addition, perceptions
about the allergic phenotype may still play a role in the
decision to prescribe omalizumab. As more experience with

 

mepolizumab is gained among treating physicians, a shift
toward mepolizumab prescription across the full range of
eligible patients with severe asthma might be seen.

Methods
MarketScan™ commercial claims and

encounters database

This database contains information about privately insured
individuals with fee-for-service, fully capitated, and partially
capitated health plans. The plans include preferred provider
organizations, point-of-service plans, indemnity plans, and
health maintenance organizations.

Assignment of patients to treatment
group

Assignment to treatment groups was hierarchical to ensure
that each patient would be included in one treatment
group. The patients administered mepolizumab during the
patient identification period were selected first regardless
of omalizumab use in that same time period; the remaining
omalizumab patients, with no evidence of mepolizumab use
during the patient identification period, were assigned to the
omalizumab treatment group. After this initial assignment,
patients prescribed mepolizumab with evidence of omalizumab use in the patient identification period were excluded.

Exclusion criteria
Patients were excluded if they did not have a diagnosis of
asthma in the 12 months prior to, or on, the index date (ICD-9

excluded if they had a chronic idiopathic urticaria diagnosis
in the absence of an asthma diagnosis in the 12 months prior
to initiating omalizumab.

Asthma-related costs

Asthma-related costs were a subset of all-cause costs calculated from claims with an asthma diagnosis in any position
on outpatient/emergency room claims and in the primary
position on inpatient claims. Costs were calculated from paid
amounts of adjudicated claims, including insurer and health
plan payments, as well as patient cost-sharing in the form of
co-payment, deductible, and co-insurance.

Results

Immunosuppressive therapy use in the
12-month baseline period

Overall, the number of patients receiving immunosuppressive
therapies (tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, interleukin inhibitors, abatacept, alemtuzumab, belimumab, canakinumab/pf,
glatiramer acetate, interferon-B-1a, interferon-B-1a/albumin
human, interferon-B-1b, peginterferon-B-1a, rituximab,
