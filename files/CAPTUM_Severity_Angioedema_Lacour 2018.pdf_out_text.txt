The burden of chronic spontaneous urticaria:
unsatisfactory treatment and healthcare resource
utilization in France (the ASSURE-CSU study)

Background: Data on the clinical burden of chronic spontaneous urticaria
(CSU) and economic consequences are lacking in France. Objectives: To
characterize the clinical and economic burden of CSU in symptomatic
patients despite treatment by analysing data of French patients from
the ASSURE-CSU study. Materials and methods: ASSURE-CSU was
an international observational study that included CSU patients with
symptoms that lasted for 12 months or more despite treatment. Disease
characteristics and healthcare resource use were obtained from medical
records. Data on disease history, health-related quality of life (HR-QoL),
and work productivity were collected from a patient survey. Results:
A total of 101 patients were analysed (76.2% female; mean age: 48.9
years) with moderate to severe disease (UAS7 score > 16) in 43.4% and
angioedema in 72.3%. The mean (S.D.) total scores of Chronic Urticaria
Quality of Life (CU-Q,oL) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)
were 37.7 (22.3) and 9.7 (6.9), respectively, thus indicating a significant
impact of the disease on HR-QoL. Mean absenteeism and presenteeism
were 6.4% and 20.8%, respectively, with a mean loss of work productivity estimated at 20.7%. The mean (S.D.) total direct cost of CSU was
€2,397 per patient per year and was mainly driven by therapies (€ 1,435)
and inpatient costs (€ 859). The indirect costs for four weeks were mainly
presenteeism (€421) and loss of work productivity (€420). Conclusion:
CSU significantly impairs HR-QoL, which increases with the severity of the disease. The direct and indirect costs for the management of
symptomatic CSU are an important economic burden.

Key words: chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic idiopathic urticaria,

rticaria is an inflammatory skin disease charac
terized by itchy wheals, angioedema, or both [1].

Histamine and other inflammatory mediators and
cytokines released by mast cells are responsible for sensory
nerve activation, vasodilatation, and plasma extravasation
[2]. Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a specific type
of urticaria, also known as chronic idiopathic urticaria, and
is defined by the spontaneous appearance of symptoms over
a period of six weeks or more [3]. There are limited data on
the prevalence on CSU, but based on results from European
studies, the prevalence is estimated at 0.5-1.0% [4].
According to recent international guidelines, the recommended first-line treatments are oral second-generation
H1-antihistamines at licensed doses [3, 5]. If the response
is insufficient within two weeks, then the dose may be
increased up to four times the licensed dose. In the systematic review and meta-analysis of Guillén-Aguinaga et
al., 63.2% of non-respondent CSU patients improved after
antihistamine up-dosing [6]. If this dose remains insufficient after four weeks, addition of another therapeutic class
is recommended; montelukast, omalizumab or cyclosporine
3].

EJD, vol. 28, n° 6, November-December 2018

The negative consequences of CSU and other forms of
chronic urticaria on health-related quality of life (HR-QoL)
and on healthcare resource utilization have been reported
in many studies [4, 7-11]. There is, however, a lack of
real-life studies, in particular, for CSU patients who are
refractory to treatment. A recent French observational study
including 1,000 CSU patients reported a significant unmet
medical need for CSU patients, even those with up-dosing
of H1-antihistamines; 51.0% of patients had an insufficient response to H1-antihistamines at the licensed dose
and 14.6% received a four-fold increased dose of whom
8.2% had an insufficient response [12].

The objective of the international ASSURE-CSU study
was to describe the burden of CSU in real-world conditions [13, 14]. For this purpose, data on disease history,
treatments, and disease activity, as well as consequences
on HR-QoL, work productivity, healthcare resource utilization, and economic burden have been recorded in six
European countries (including France) and Canada. The
data from the ASSURE-CSU study offered the opportunity
to obtain an overview of CSU in real-world conditions in
France.

Patients and methods

Study design

ASSURE-CSU (ASsessment of the economic and humanistic burden of chronic Spontaneous/idiopathic URticaria
patiEnts) was an international, observational, multicentre
study performed in seven countries (The United Kingdom,
Germany, Canada, France, Italy, Spain, and The Netherlands). The study protocol and the global results have been
recently published [13, 14].

The objectives of this observational study were to assess
the clinical and economic burden of CSU in symptomatic
patients despite treatment. For this purpose, HR-QoL,
healthcare resource utilization, absence from work, and productivity loss have been assessed. We present here, in detail,
the outcomes of French CSU patients.

The study included retrospective patient medical record
abstraction (12 months), a cross-sectional patient survey,
and a seven-day patient diary to evaluate HR-QoL and
productivity. The study procedures had no impact on the
medical care delivered to patients.

Patients aged 18 years or older were included in urticaria
specialty centres if they met the following criteria:

— aconfirmed diagnosis of CSU, defined as the occurrence
of spontaneous wheals and/or angioedema for at least six
weeks without an obvious cause [15];

— at least one treatment course with an H1-antihistamine;
— symptoms for more than 12 months, occurring at least
three days per week, and currently symptomatic despite
treatment.

The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local independent
Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was obtained
from each patient.

Data collected

Demographics, clinical data, and healthcare resource use
were obtained from patients’ medical records. Patients completed a survey in order to collect information on resource
use, not reflected in medical records, and impact of the disease on patient-reported outcomes. The patient survey also
recorded work days missed and productivity losses associated with CSU. The following patient-reported outcomes
were completed:

— the Weekly Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) is a twoitem assessment of key urticaria symptoms (wheals and
pruritus) assessed twice daily, with the average daily score
summed over seven days. This provides an evaluation of
disease activity and a change in score provides an evaluation of response to treatment [16]. The UAS7 provides an
overall urticaria activity score of 0 to 42 with higher scores
indicative of greater severity;

— the Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire
(CU-Q:0L) is a 23-item instrument designed to measure
urticaria-specific HR-QoL. Six dimensions are rated: pruritus, impact on life activities, sleep problems, limits, looks,
and swelling. A total score and six domain scores are

796

reported on a scale of 0 to 100 with higher scores indicative
of worse HR-QoL [17];

— the Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (AEQoL) is a 17-item instrument designed to measure the
quality of life for patients with angioedema. Four domains
are explored (functioning, fatigue/mood, fears/shame, and
nutrition). The score of each domain and the total score vary
from 0 (no alteration of quality of life) to 100 (maximal
alteration);

— the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a
dermatology-specific 10-item instrument, which assesses
patients’ perception of the impact of their skin disease on
different aspects of their HR-QoL over the previous week.
The items of the DLQI include symptoms and feelings,
daily activities, leisure, work or school, personal relationships, and side effects of treatment. Each question is scored
on a four-point Likert scale. Higher scores indicate greater
impairment of patient’s quality of life [18];

— the EuroQol 5 Dimensions 3 Levels (EQ-5D-3L)
is a standardized measure of health status. It comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities,
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension
has three levels: no problems, some problems and extreme
problems. The responses are converted into a single utility
index value: | represents full health and 0 represents death.
In addition to the descriptive scale, the EQ-5D-3L includes
a visual analogue scale (VAS) that corresponds to patient
ratings of their current health (from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the best imaginable health state and 0 the worst
imaginable health state);

— the productivity of employed subjects was assessed using
the six-item Work Productivity and Activity Impairment
Questionnaire: Specific Health Problem (WPAI-SHP) version 2.0 [19]. The WPAI-SHP was administered at the
completion of the seven-day diary. The WPAI-SHP has four
subscales, which include “absenteeism”, “presenteeism”,
“work productivity loss”, and “activity impairment”. The
scores for these subscales are expressed as impairment percentages. Higher scores reflect greater impairment and less
productivity.

Statistical analysis

The analysis was essentially descriptive and no formal
hypothesis was tested. Mean values, standard deviations
(S.D.), medians, and ranges were calculated for continuous
variables whereas counts and percentages were calculated
for categorical variables. Analyses were performed using
SAS software version 9.3 or higher (SAS Institute, Inc.,
Cary, North Carolina, US).

For the direct cost calculations, costing algorithms were
used to assign 2014 unit costs from published sources
[20]. Indirect costs for workdays missed and lost productivity related to CSU were calculated by the human capital
approach using specific average wage and hours worked per
country [21].

2015. A majority of patients were female (76.2%) with a
mean age at enrolment of 48.9 years (table /). The mean
duration from diagnosis to enrolment was 64.6 months
(median: 25 months). At the time of diagnosis, the severity
of the CSU had been rated as moderate to severe by the
physician for 79.2% of patients.

The most frequent comorbid conditions present at inclusion were allergic rhinitis (16.8%), asthma (11.9%), and
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (10.9%) (table 2).

The mean (S.D.) UAS7 score was 16.1 (10.4) and 43.4% of
patients had a score rated > 16 by the patient in the prospective seven-day period after inclusion, thus indicating that the
disease severity was moderate to severe.

Consequences of CSU on health-related quality
of life and daily life

The mean (S.D.) total score of the CU-Q20L questionnaire
was 37.7 (22.3) (table 3). The most affected domains were
“pruritus” (62.9), “sleep problems” (43.8), and “looks”
(38.8). As expected, the impact on the urticaria-related quality of life increased with the UAS7 scores (figure 1A). Thus,
patients with the highest UAS7 scores (28-42) achieved 84
for “pruritus” score.

The mean (S.D.) total score of the DLQI questionnaire
was 9.7 (6.9) with 43.9% of patients achieving a DLQI
score >10, indicating a very large to an extremely large
effect of the skin disorder on quality of life (table 3). The
most affected domains were “symptoms and feelings” (3.3),
“daily activities” (2.1) (both scored from 0 to 6), and “work
and school” (1.9) (scored from 0 to 3).

The mean (S.D.) EQ-5D-3L utility score was 0.62 (0.31)
and mean (S.D.) score of VAS was 63.9 (22.8), thus indi

of patients), “anxiety/depression” (71.4%), and “usual
activities” (34.3%).

CSU patients with angioedema and impact on
quality of life

CSU-associated angioedema episodes were reported in
medical records for 73 patients (72.3%), including in the
past 12 months for 55 (75.3%) of these patients. The
mean (S.D.) number of episodes in the past 12 months
was 28.7 (59.6) (median: 11.0). Among the 99 patients
who completed the patient survey, 80 (80.8%) experienced
angioedema, including 75 (75.8%) in the past 12 months.

Among CSU patients who reported angioedema in the
past four weeks (n = 50), angioedema significantly affected
HR-QoL with respect to all domains of the AE-QoL
questionnaire (mean total score: 56.1), in particular,
“fears/shame” (70.8) and “fatigue/mood” (49.0) (table 3).
The impact on these domains was higher for patients with
higher UAS7 scores (figure 1B).

When patients with CSU-associated angioedema were
asked to quantify their symptoms (from 0 to 10), the mean
(S.D.) scores of intensity were 7.2 (2.2) for swelling, 7.5
(2.7) for itching, and 6.2 (3.4) for pain. When they experienced an angioedema episode, 54.7% reported that they
took a medication prescribed by their physician, 25.3%
applied ice to the affected areas, 17.3% went to the emergency department, and 6.7% took an over-the-counter
medication, whereas 17.3% did nothing.

Consequences of CSU on professional life and
work productivity

Among the 57 employed patients, nine (16.1%) missed at
least one work hour due to CSU in the past seven days witha
median number of hours missed of 3.5 (interquartile range:

2-35). During this period, mean (S.D.) absenteeism and presenteeism were 6.4% (23.1) and 20.8% (23.4), respectively.
The consequence was a mean loss of work productivity estimated at 20.7% (24.2). Among the nine patients who missed
at least one work hour, the main reasons were angioedema
(n=5) and itching (n=3).

Treatment of CSU

Almost all patients (91.1%) received second-generation
H1-antihistamines in the past 12 months, whereas 38.6%
received leukotriene receptor antagonists (figure 2). Of note,
about one patient out of four (26.7%) received sedative H1antihistamines. Other treatments received for CSU in the
past 12 months were oral corticosteroids (16.8%; median

798

duration: 108 days), immunosuppressants (14.9%), or antiIgE (5.0%). Combinations of treatments were frequent:
multiple H1-antihistamines (57.4%), H1-antihistamines
plus any other class (27.7%), or H1-antihistamines plus
leukotriene receptor antagonist (14.9%).

Use of healthcare resource related to CSU

At least one CSU-related visit to a healthcare professional
was recorded in patient files in the past 12 months for
69.3% of patients, with a mean (S.D.) of 2.7 (2.4) visits.
Among specialists, dermatologists (47.5% of patients) were
the most frequently visited.

Admissions to the emergency room were reported for
15.8% of patients and inpatient hospital stays for 26.7%

was related to diagnostic testing (45.8%).

According to the patient survey, the most frequent healthcare visits in the past three months were for family
doctors (49.5% of patients; mean: 2.7 visits), dermatologists (22.2%; 2.1 visits), alternative medicine practitioners
(22.2%; 3.8 visits), and allergists (19.2%; 1.6 visits).

Direct and indirect costs of CSU

Direct and indirect costs of CSU per patient and per
year were calculated based on medical record abstraction
(table 4). The mean (S.D.) total direct cost was €2,397
and was mainly driven by therapies (€ 1,435) and inpatient
costs (€859).

The indirect costs over a four-week period were mainly
driven by presenteeism (€421) and work productivity loss
(€420).

Discussion

Our national analysis of the data from the international
ASSURE-CSU study offers quantitative information on the
burden of CSU in France in real-life conditions. This is, to
our knowledge, the first study which reports both the impact
of CSU on HR-QoL and the economic consequences of this
debilitating skin disease in France. One of the strengths of
the study is the recruitment of patients in urticaria specialty
centres and the combination of data from medical records
and data reflecting the perception of CSU by patients.

Demographics and characteristics of French patients
included in our analysis were comparable to the data
for the global cohort and from other studies [14, 22-25].

eases) are frequently reported for CSU patients [26-29].
Thus, rates of allergic rhinitis as high as 40-50% have
been reported in CSU patients [27, 28]. Only 16.8% of
French patients had allergic rhinitis. This rate is, however,
lower than the prevalence of allergic rhinitis in the French
adult population [30]. The rate of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis
was clearly higher than the prevalence of this autoimmune
disease in the French population (10.9%; in the global
cohort: 6.7%). For the other allergic and autoimmune diseases, the numbers of patients were too low to compare. In
the recent observational ETNA study performed in France
based on 1,259 chronic urticaria patients (including 1,001
CSU patients), allergic rhinitis was reported in 23.7% o
CSU patients and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis in 3.5% [12].
The presence of angioedema has frequently a negative
impact on QoL due to pain or alteration of the physical
aspect related to oedema [31]. In the literature, rates o
CSU-associated angioedema from 33% to 55% are reporte
[23-26, 32]. In the French cohort, 72.3% of patients had an
angioedema reported in medical records, including 54.5%
in the past 12 months. In the patient survey, 75.8% o
patients reported having experienced angioedema in the
past 12 months. These rates were higher than those reporte:
in the global cohort (58.5% and 41.0% for medical records
and 65.8% for the patient survey, respectively). The reasons
for these higher rates of angioedema in French patients are
unclear.

Almost half of the patients had moderate to severe CSU an
all scores of HR-QoL (DLQI, CU-Q 0L, AE-QoL) were
clearly impacted by skin disease; this impact increased with
the severity of the disease. Overall, the QoL scores of the
French cohort were comparable to the global cohort, except
for the percentage of patients who reported moderate to
extreme problems in the “anxiety/depression” dimension
(EQ-5D-3L utility score), which was higher than that for
French patients (71.4% versus 47.4% in the global cohort).
Overall, almost all patients (>90%) received the recommended treatment for CSU, namely second-generation

CSU refractory to Hl-antihistamines, as add-on therapy
to second-generation H1-antihistamines [3]. In the past 12
months, 5.0% of patients were treated with omalizumab,
but the more extensive indication of this product for CSU
was approved by French authorities in October 2015, after
the end of this study. Therefore, future studies will be use

ful to evaluate the role of this new therapeutic class in CSU
treatment.

The economic burden of CSU in France remains largely
unexplored. A previous study more than 10 years ago evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a Hl-antihistamine based
on the results of two placebo-controlled trials [33]. Our
approach was different since we evaluated the indirect and
direct cost of patients engaged in real-world healthcare.
Thus, we report that 15.8% of CSU patients were admitted to the emergency room and 26.7% were hospitalized
(including for diagnostic testing) in the past 12 months.
The CSU symptoms contributed to a significant loss of
productivity, mainly due to presenteeism (one out of five
patients was impaired at work). Overall, the burden of CSU
for patients and society appears to be heavier than generally considered. Our results are in line with a French study
that compared the impact of different skin diseases (chronic
urticaria, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis) on HR-QoL and
concluded that severe impairment of chronic urticaria was
often underestimated [34].

This study has some limitations. Only patients who were
symptomatic for at least 12 months despite treatment were
recruited. As a consequence, study patients were not representative of the general population of CSU patients. Another
limitation was that the patient survey was dependent on
patient memory. Nevertheless, biases related to indirect
costs were limited since data necessary for calculating
absenteeism, presenteeism, and work productivity loss were
prospectively recorded after completion of a seven-day
diary. For the retrospective medical record review, some
data may have been missing in medical records. Since direct
cost evaluations were based on medical records, the direct
costs could have been underestimated.

In conclusion, CSU has significant impairment on HR-QoL
which increases with the severity of the disease. The direct
and indirect costs of symptomatic CSU are a significant
economic burden. ll
