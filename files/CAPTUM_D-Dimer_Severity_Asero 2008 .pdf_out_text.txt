Severe chronic urticaria is associated with elevated plasma levels

of D-dimer

Background: Patients with chronic urticaria (CU) frequently show signs of
thrombin generation as a result of the activation of the extrinsic pathway of
coagulation and signs of fibrinolysis as shown by slightly increased mean
D-dimer plasma levels. Here, we studied patients with severe CU to see whether
the activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis parallels the severity of the disease.
Methods: Eight consecutive patients with severe exacerbations of CU and 13
with slight CU were studied. Plasma prothrombin fragment F; ,2 as well as
D-dimer were measured by ELISA. Serum histamine-releasing activity was
assessed by basophil histamine release assay. Seventy-four normal subjects were
used as controls.

Results: In patients with severe CU, median levels of both D-dimer (11.20 nmol/
1) and F; +2 (592 pmol/l) largely exceeded those found in patients with slight CU
[D-dimer: 2.66 nmol/l (P = 0.001) and F, +2: 228 pmol/l (P = 0.003)] and in
normal subjects [D-dimer: 1.41 nmol/l (P = 0.0001) and F, +>: 159 pmol/l

(P = 0.0001)]. Sera from 25% of patients with severe CU and 31% of those with
slight CU, but from none of normal subjects, showed in vitro histamine-releasing
activity. D-dimer and Fj +2 levels were significantly correlated each other

(r = 0.64, P = 0.002) and with CU severity score (r = 0.80-0.90, P = 0.0001),
but no correlation was observed between serum histamine-releasing activity and
coagulation parameters or severity score.

Conclusions: Severe exacerbations of CU are associated with a strong activation
of coagulation cascade and fibrinolysis. Whether this activation is the cause of
CU or acts as an amplification system is still a matter of debate.

Chronic ordinary urticaria (CU) has long been considered
as a ‘mysterious’ disorder and has been often ascribed to
anxiety or intolerance to foods, food dyes and food
additives. It is now clear that in a substantial proportion
of cases CU is an autoimmune disorder caused by
histamine-releasing autoantibodies directed against the
alfa subunit of the high affinity IgE receptor (anti-FceRI)
or against IgE (anti-IgE) (1, 2). These autoantibodies can
be demonstrated in vivo by intradermal injection of
autologous serum (ASST), which is commonly used in
clinical settings, and in vitro by a functional assay
employing basophils from normal donors (as a satisfactory immunoassay for anti FceRI and anti-IgE antibodies
is not available) (3, 4). The pathomechanism remains
elusive in those cases of CU in which ASST is negative
and no histamine-releasing autoantibodies can be demonstrated. Indirect evidence of the possible involvement
of the coagulation cascade in CU came from the
observation that the proportion of skin test-positive
patients rises substantially if autologous plasma is

injected instead of autologous serum (about 80%
vs 50%). Elevated plasma levels of prothrombin fragment
F, +2, suggesting thrombin generation were detected in
CU patients (5), and recent findings showed that this is
the result of the activation of the tissue factor pathway of
coagulation cascade (6). In animal models thrombin has
been shown to increase vascular permeability (7, 8) both
directly, acting on endothelial cells (9), and indirectly,
inducing release of proinflammatory mediators by mast
cells (8, 10, 11), and to generate CSa in the absence of C3,
thus bypassing the whole first part of the complement
cascade (12). Furthermore, in outpatients with slight to
moderate CU, mean D-dimer plasma levels were significantly higher than in a group of age- and sex-matched
normal controls, although only in very few cases D-dimer
levels exceeded the normal range (6). In this study,
D-dimer and F,+ 2 plasma levels were measured in a
selected population of patients with particularly severe
CU to see if the activation of the coagulation cascade is
related to the severity of the disease.
Methods
Patients

Eight consecutive adults (M/F 3/5; mean age + SD 47 + 22)
admitted to the Dermatology Clinic or to the Allergy Unit of the
Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, University of Milan, Italy, because
of severe exacerbations of CU were studied. CU was diagnosed on
the basis of a history of continuous or recurrent hives with or
without angioedema for more than 6 weeks (9). Physical urticarias
and other possible causes of urticaria (food and drug allergy, bacterial infections and parasitoses) were excluded on the basis of
clinical history and appropriate investigations (i.e., physical tests,
skin prick tests and/or specific IgE determinations, search for bacterial foci and parasites). Urticarial activity was estimated according
to the number of wheals present at the time when blood samples
from our patients were collected as previously described (10): 1-10
small (<3 cm in diameter) wheals grade 1 (slight); 10-50 small
wheals or 1-10 large wheals grade 2 (moderate); >50 small wheals
or > 10 large wheals grade 3 (severe); virtually covered with wheals
grade 4 (very severe). Based on this scale of disease activity, eight
patients were considered as having a severe disease (two of them
were almost completely covered with wheals) and 13 as having a
slight to moderate disease when they were first visited and when
blood samples for in vitro studies were drawn. At the time of blood
collection the patients were not assuming any medication. Sodium
citrate-anticoagulated plasmas and sera from patients and from 74
normal subjects were stored into plastic cones at —20°C until in vitro
assays were carried out. The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, and all subjects gave
their informed consent before participation.

Prothrombin fragment;,2 measurement

Prothrombin fragment F,.2. was measured by a sandwich
ELISA (Enzygnost F;+.; Behring Diagnostics GmbH, Frankfurt,
Germany) (13, 14) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Intraassay and inter-assay CVs were 5% and 8% respectively.

D-dimer measurement

D-dimer levels were measured by ELISA (Zymutest D-dimer;
Hyphen BioMed, Neuville-sur-Oise, France) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of
variation were 10% and 15% respectively.

Basophil histamine release assay

A leucocyte suspension from a normal blood donor was prepared
by dextran sedimentation of peripheral venous blood, anticoagulated with 0.01 M EDTA, and mixed with 6% dextran in saline
solution (Plander 70, Fresenius Kabi Italia, Isola della Scala,
Verona, Italy) and 30 mM dextrose (Sigma Chemicals, St Louis,
MO, USA). The cells were allowed to settle for 60-90 min at room
temperature. Then leucocyte-rich plasma was aspirated and centrifuged at 300 g for 15 min at 4°C, and the cell button was washed
twice in Tyrode’s buffer, pH 7.4, containing (mM) 140 NaCl, 5.5
dextrose, 2.7 KCl, 0.36 NaH2PO,, and 12 NaHCO3. Leucocytes
(with about 7 x 10* basophils) were resuspended in 100 yl volume
of Tyrode’s buffer with 1.8 mM CaCl, and 0.5 mM MgCh, and
incubated with 100 ul of the serum under examination, making a
final volume of 200 pl. After incubation for 40 min at 37°C, the
reaction was stopped by addition of 800 pl of ice-cold buffer solution and centrifugation at 1000 g for 10 min at 4°C. After centri

fugation, the supernatants were aspirated, mixed with an equal
volume of 6% HCIO, and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min at 4°C.
Histamine concentration in the supernatants was measured by an
automated fluorimetric method, according to Ruff et al. (17).
Spontaneous histamine release was evaluated by measuring histamine concentration in the supernatant of unstimulated cells, incubated for 40 min at 37°C. Total histamine content was obtained by
adding 100 pl of 6% HCIO, to 100 ul of cell suspension. Net histamine release was calculated as percentage of total histamine
content, after subtraction of spontaneous release. A 5% release cutoff value was used. Sera were tested with leucocyte suspension from
one normal donor whose basophils were previously shown to release
30% of total histamine content on challenge with an optimal dose of
goat polyclonal anti-human IgE (10 pg/ml; Sigma Chemicals).

Statistical analysis

Data are reported as median and interquartile range (25th and 75th
percentiles). Differences between groups were evaluated by
Mann-Whitney nonparametric test. Correlation was evaluated by
Spearman’s rank test. Significance level was set at P < 0.05.

Results

Plasma D-dimer levels were significantly higher in
patients with severe CU [median and interquartile range
11.20 nmol/l (5.68-86.13 nmol/l)] than in patients with
mild disease [2.66 nmol/l (1.21—5.00 nmol/l)] and in
normal subjects [1.41 nmol/l (0.96-1.62 nmol/l)] (P =
0.001 and P = 0.0001 by comparison with positive and
negative controls respectively) (Fig. 1). Similarly, in
patients with severe disease, F,, 2 plasma _ levels
[592 pmol/l (530-1744 pmol/l)] largely exceeded those
found both in patients with slight urticaria [228 pmol/l
(180-420 pmol/l); P = 0.003] and in normal subjects
[159 pmol/l (123-196 pmol/l); P = 0.0001] (Fig. 2). The
correlation between the severity score of single patients
and individual plasma levels of D-dimer and F; +. is
shown in Fig. 3.

In one patient we had the opportunity to measure
plasma levels of D-dimer and F, +2 during an episode of
severe exacerbation of the disease and at remission after
1 week of therapy with steroids, antihistamines and low
molecular weight heparin. At remission we observed a
dramatic reduction of plasma levels of D-dimer (from
110.18 nmol/l to 0.64 nmol/l) and F; +2 (from 603 pmol/l
to 160 pmol/l). Another patient who showed very high
plasma levels of D-dimer (575.45 nmol/l) and F,+2
(1998.61 pmol/l) was checked again after 1 year during
disease remission obtained with steroids and antihistamines, and also in this patient, we found a dramatic drop
in plasma levels of both D-dimer (2.06 nmol/l) and F; +2
(116.78 pmol/l) (Fig. 4).

release was similar in patients with severe or mild CU
(P = NS). In the 21 patients with CU, D-dimer and F, ,>
levels were significantly correlated (r = 0.64, P = 0.002),
whereas coagulation parameters were not correlated with
serum histamine-releasing activity [neither D-dimer (r =
0.054; P = 0.815) nor Fi +2 (r = 0.087; P = 0.707)].

Discussion

In previous studies we observed an activation of coagulation cascade via the tissue factor pathway in most
outpatients with mild to moderate CU (5, 6). We
interpreted the light increase of plasma D-dimer levels
found as the result of a minimal activation of fibrinolysis
(6). In this study, we found significantly elevated fragment F,,, and D-dimer plasma levels, which are wellknown markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis activation,
ina selected group of patients with severe exacerbation of
CU, showing that in this subset the coagulation cascade
may be activated, up to the production of fibrin as a
result of the generation of thrombin. As experimental
data have demonstrated the vasopermeability effect of
thrombin (7, 8), its generation should be considered
relevant to the pathophysiology of the disease. This is

further supported by the dramatic drop of D-dimer and
F, +2 plasma levels which were extremely high during an
acute phase of severe CU and perfectly normal after
remission (Fig. 4).

Although direct evidence is still missing, thrombin
could be involved in CU not only because it increases
vascular permeability but also because it can induce mast
cell degranulation, a phenomenon that is crucial to
the pathophysiology of CU (7, 8, 10). Whether this

phenomenon is the cause of the disease or acts simply as
an amplification system is still to be defined. It is
conceivable that autoantibodies and activation of the
coagulation cascade act synergistically in some patients.
It is notable that, although serum histamine-releasing
activity was significantly higher in CU patients than in
normal subjects, only two of eight (25%) patients with
severe CU and four of 13 (31%) patients with mild CU
had evidence of circulating histamine releasing factors as
shown by the basophil assay. While these proportions are
in line with those found in our previous studies (16), they
further suggest that mechanisms of histamine release
other than autoantibodies may be operating in CU. The
fact that both F,,,. and D-dimer plasma levels were
increased in patients with severe CU, and to a lesser
extent in patients with mild CU, but were not correlated
with histamine-releasing activity of patients’ sera suggests
that activation of the coagulation cascade and serum

histamine-releasing autoantibodies might both separately
contribute to the pathomechanism of CU. The relative
weight of coagulation factors and that of histaminereleasing autoantibodies seem to vary from one patient to
another suggesting that multiple mechanisms are involved
in CU.

Although our study considered a relatively small
number of patients, our data also provide the rationale
for the evaluation of anticoagulant therapy in large
populations of CU patients as to date the efficacy of
heparin and warfarin in the treatment of CU has been
assessed only in scattered reports (17, 18).
