The Effect of Omalizumab on Hematological and Inflammatory Parameters in Patients
with Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria

Abstract:

Purpose: The mechanism of action of omalizumab in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is
not exactly known. In previous studies, D-dimer which is a fibrin-degradation product and
interleukin-31 which has a role in inflammation were found to be decreased in patients with
chronic urticaria (CU) treated with omalizumab. However, to our knowledge, there is no
study on the effects of omalizumab on the ratio of neutrophil to lymphocyte (NLR) and the
ratio of platelet to lymphocyte (PLR) which are inflammatory parameters in patientsywith
CSU in the PubMed database. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effeets of omalizumab
on hematological and inflammatory parameters in patients with CSU!

Materials and Methods: A hundred six CSU patients treated.withomalizumab were
evaluated retrospectively. Complete blood count (CBC),and,C*reactive protein (CRP) levels
before treatment and at the third month of treatment were recorded. NLR and PLR were
calculated from the CBC results. CBC parameters, RP levels, NLR and PLR of the patients
before treatment and at the end of third.month of treatment were compared.

Results: There was a significant decrease’in white blood cell count, platelet count, neutrophil
count, CRP level, NLR and.PER and a significant increase in mean platelet volume and
eosinophil count withyomalizumab treatment in CSU patients (p<0.05). Basophil count
increased; but there was no statistically significant difference (p=0.293).

Conclusion: This study shows that omalizumab has not only anti Ig E effect; but also it may

has inhibitory effects on inflammation and coagulation in CSU patients.
Further prospective studies are warranted in order to evaluate the effect of omalizumab on
hematological and inflammatory parameters and correlation between omalizumab response
rate and these inflammatory parameters in CSU patients.

Introduction:

Urticaria is a common group of diseases characterized by pruritic wheals‘and/or
angioedema. If the symptoms last more than 6 weeks, it is called as chronic urticaria (CU)'.
CU is divided into 2 groups; chronic inducible urticaria (CIU) and chronic spontaneous
urticaria (CSU)! 3. Pathogenesis of CU is not exactly elucidated; but various mechanisms
such as autoimmunity, inflammation and coagulation may play roles’.

C-Reactive Protein (CRP) is a sensitive,systemio,marker of inflammation. It was high
in patients with CU and correlation with disease activity were reported in previous
studies® ~ ° . The platelet count, mean_platelet Volume (MPV), the ratio of neutrophil to
lymphocyte (NLR) and the ratio of platelet to lymphocyte (PLR) can be obtained from the
complete blood count (CBC). which are cheap and easily accessible. Activation of coagulation
cascade in patients with*CUshas been reported. There is a close relationship between
coagulation and inflammation?*. MPV is an important marker of platelet reactivity and is an
indicator of inflammation"®. In the literature, platelet count and MPV have been evaluated in
patients with urticaria and there are conflicting results! '*. In recent years, NLR and PLR
have been used as inflammatory markers in many diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis,

familial mediterranean fever, psoriasis and as prognostic factor in oncological
diseases'® ~ '9

. To our knowledge, there is no study evaluating these inflammatory markers
in patients with urticaria in the PubMed database.

Omalizumab is used as a second-line therapy in the antihistamine-resistant CSU’”?.
The mechanism of action of omalizumab in CSU is not exactly known?°. A decrease in Ddimer levels which is a fibrin-degradation product and in interleukin-31 (IL-31) levels which
have a role in inflammation, in CU patients treated with omalizumab have been reported?!’”.
To our knowledge, our study is the first study on the effect of omalizumab on NLR and PLR
in patients with CSU

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of omalizumab on hematoldgical.and

inflammatory parameters in patients with CSU.

Materials and Methods:

Local ethics committee approved the study protoéolA total of 252 CSU patients
treated with omalizumab in our dermatology department, between 2013 and 2017 were
evaluated retrospectively.

A total of 106 patients, 76 women and.30 men, who received at least 3 doses of 300
mg/month subcutaneous omalizumab and had available CBC before treatment and at the end
of third month of treatment,(before taking the fourth dose of omalizumab), were included in
the study. Patients with active infection, hepatic disease, malignancy, hematologic disease and
on immunosuppressive, iron-containing, platelet function affecting and other treatment of
urticaria except antihistamines were excluded. CBC parameters [erythrocyte, hemoglobin,
leukocyte, platelet, neutrophil, lymphocyte, eosinophil, basophil and monocyte counts, red
cell distribution width (RDW), platelet distribution width (PDW), MPV] and CRP levels were
recorded. NLR ( was calculated as the neutrophil count divided by the lymphocyte count) and

PLR (was calculated as the platelet count divided by the lymhocyte count) were obtained
from the CBC results. CBC parameters, NLR, PLR and CRP levels of the patients before
treatment and at the end of third month of treatment were compared. All patients included in
the study had hemogram parameters before treatment and at the end of third month of
treatment, whereas 39 had CRP levels before treatment, 26 of them had CRP levels at the end
of third month of treatment.

Erythrocyte and platelet counts by impedance method and leukocyte subgroups by
laser optics method had been measured on LH 750 analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA,
USA). The CRP test had been performed on NFL BN-II (Dade. Behring, Siemens) device by
immunonephelometric method.

IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0 software was used for the data analyses.(Continuous data

 

was presented as mean + standard deviation and median. Categorical ‘data was presented in
percentage. The Shapiro Wilk test was used to search the normal distribution compliance of
data. Dependent sample t test was used to compare peergroupswith normal distribution. The
Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test was used to compare peerygroups that were not in compliance
with normal distribution. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for variables that
were not in conformity with normal distribution in determining the direction and size of the
relationship (correlation) between variables. p<0.05 value was accepted to be statistically

significant.

Results:

Seventy six of 106 patients (71.7%) were female and 30 patients (28.3%) were male.

 

The mean age of the patients was 45.02+12.50 (min:19, max:78). There was a statistically
significant decrease in WBC count, platelet count, neutrophil count, CRP level, NLR and

PLR, and an increase in MPV and eosinophil count with omalizumab treatment in CSU
patients (p <0.05). Basophil count increased; but there was not statistically significant

difference (p=0.293) (Table 1).

Discussion:

The pathogenesis of CU is complex and not exactly elucidated. Various mechanisms
such as autoimmunity, inflammation and coagulation are thought to to be involved in
pathogenesis of CU*.

Second generation H1 antihistamines are used as first-line therapy in the CU.
Omalizumab is used as a second-line therapy in the antihistamine-resistant CU}"s
Omalizumab is a recombinant DNA-derived humanized immunoglobulin(Ig) GPK
monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to human Ig E. The mechanism of action of
omalizumab in CSU is not exactly known. Omalizumab bindseireelgE with high affinity and
prevents binding of allergen specific Ig E to the low affinityIg‘E receptor (FcERI). It does not
bind to Ig E on the cell surface. It reduces free dg E levels; a decrease in free Ig E levels leads
to a decrease in FcERI receptors on basophils and mast cells. Apart from this mechanism, it is
thought that it decreases the activity ofdg G,autoantibodies against FcERI, Ig E and Ig E
autoantibodies against autoantigensy(thyroperoxidase, ds DNA). Omalizumab also reverses
the basopenia, corrects the-basophil Ig E receptor function, decreases the abnormal intrinsic
Ig E activity and inhibits coagulation that plays a role in the etiopathogenesis of CSU?°.
Yalcin et al reported that D-dimer levels decreased in CU patients treated with omalizumab”'.
In another study, IL-31 levels that play an important role in the initiation of chronic skin
inflammation, were decreased in patients with CSU successfully treated with omalizumab”.
These studies demonstrate that omalizumab may have inhibitory effects on inflammation and

coagulation in CU patients.
Thrombin is a potent agonist of platelets that plays a role in the pathogenesis of
urticaria and induces activation of platelets”*. Platelets establish an important link between
inflammation, thrombosis and atherosclerosis, and release many mediators that are important
for these processes. MPV is an important marker that shows platelet reactivity and is an
indicator for inflammation!®. Relationship between high MPV values and increased disease

4925,

activity in some inflammatory diseases have been reported**’?’. However, there are

conflicting results in studies evaluating MPV levels in CU patients'®” '*

. In our study, there
was a Statistically significant increase in MPV values with omalizumab treatment. The effect
of omalizumab on MPV values should be confirmed with further prospective studies)

Alicja Kasperska-Zajac et al reported that platelet counts were significantly higher in
patients with moderate CSU compared with mild CSU and control group, and also platelet
counts and CRP levels are correlated'*. It has been suggestedthat platelets may play a role in
pathogenesis of CSU. In our study, we found significant/deerease in the platelet counts with
omalizumab treatment. Our results support theanhibitory, effect of omalizumab on platelets in
the treatment of CSU.

Chronic urticaria is associated withthe inflammatory response accompanied with mast
cell activation. CRP is a sensitive’systemic marker of inflammation. It has been shown that
CRP levels are high in patients with CU and correlated with activity of CU® ~ ° . In our
study, a significant decreasein CRP levels with omalizumab treatment in patients with CSU
has been found. Furth@rmore, we found a significant decrease in WBC and neutrophil counts
with omalizumab treatment in our study. NLR and PLR are markers of the systemic
inflammatory response and may be used in monitoring inflammation. They can easily be
calculated by parameters obtained from CBC. They have been used as inflammatory markers
in many diseases and as prognostic factor in various oncologic diseases in recent

15 - 19

studies . To our knowledge, there is no study evaluating NLR and PLR in patients with
CU in the PubMed database. In our study, a significant decrease in NLR and PLR with
omalizumab treatment has been found. This supports that omalizumab may have antiinflammatory effects in CSU patients.

Lorenzo et al. reported that eosinophil count was significantly higher in patients with
acute urticaria and symptomatic CU than control group?®. However, we found an increase in
eosinophil counts with omalizumab treatment in CSU patients. Eosinophil counts may
increase reactively with omalizumab treatment. Generally, during active disease period,
basopenia is seen in CSU patients due to basophil migration into skin. Basopenia reverses
with treatment or regression of urticarial lesions?’?”. Similarly, in our study ther@\was,an
increase in basophil counts with omalizumab treatment but this increase was not Statistically
significant.

There are limitations of our study. There was not detailed clinical findings, severity of
disease and response to omalizumab treatment of patientS due to retrospective design.

In conclusion, there was a significant decrease in, WBC count, platelet count,
neutrophil count, PLR, NLR and CRP levéhand a significant increase in MPV and eosinophil
count with omalizumab treatment in patients with CSU. Our study shows that omalizumab
has not only anti Ig E effect, but it also'may has inhibitory effects on inflammation and
coagulation in CSU patients, Further prospective studies are warranted in order to evaluate the
effect of omalizumabon hematological and inflammatory parameters and correlation between
response rate to omalizumab and these parameters in CSU patients. These parameters may be

used in monitoring response rate to omalizumab.
