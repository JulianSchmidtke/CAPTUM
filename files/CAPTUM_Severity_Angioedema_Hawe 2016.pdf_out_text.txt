Abstract

Objectives To obtain utility estimates suitable for use in
economic models for chronic spontaneous (idiopathic)
urticaria (CSU).

Methods Patient-level data from three randomized clinical trials—ASTERIA I, ASTERIA II and GLACIAL—
were analysed. Health states were derived from the Urticaria Activity Score over 7 days (UAS7); higher scores
denote greater activity. The health state score ranges were
urticaria free: 0; well-controlled urticaria: 1-6; mild urticaria: 7-15; moderate urticaria: 16-27; and severe urti

caria: 23-42. The mean EQ-SD utilities were calculated for
each health state. A mixed model was used to predict the
EQ-5D according to UAS7 health states in a pooled data
set containing all treatment arms and time points from the
three trials. Pooled trial data were validated through visual
comparisons and interaction terms. Fixed and random
effects for trials and patients were included, along with the
following covariates: UAS7 health state at baseline (moderate or severe); presence of angioedema at baseline and
during follow-up; duration of CSU; number of previous
CSU medications; visit; current treatment; and patient age
and sex.

Results There was a consistent improvement in EQ-5D
utilities as urticaria activity decreased. The mean utilities
ranged from 0.710 (severe urticaria) to 0.780 (moderate
urticaria), 0.829 (mild urticaria), 0.862 (well-controlled
urticaria) and 0.894 (urticaria free). Sensitivity and subgroup analyses confirmed the robustness of the results.
Conclusion The results suggest that EQ-SD utility scores
increase with decreasing urticaria activity. EQ-5D utility
scores enable the health-related quality of life of CSU
patients to be compared with that of patients with other
diseases.

Key Points for Decision Makers

 

Although an increasing amount of knowledge is
available about the health-related quality of life of
patients with chronic spontaneous (idiopathic)
urticaria, no health state utilities have been
established for this condition. Utilities are key data
for economic models used in making reimbursement
decisions in many countries.

This paper presents utilities for different levels of
disease activity of chronic spontaneous urticaria.
This information will be valuable for future costeffectiveness models. Utilities measured by generic
measures, such as the EQ-5D, allow for healthrelated quality-of-life comparisons between different
disease areas.

Evaluation of these utilities provides robust results
for health technology assessment bodies to evaluate
the cost effectiveness of treatments for chronic
spontaneous urticaria and quantification of health
gains by calculation of quality-adjusted life-years.

1 Introduction

Chronic spontaneous (also known as idiopathic) urticaria
(CSU) is defined by the current European Academy of
Allergy and Clinical Immunology/Global Allergy and
Asthma European Network/European Dermatology Forum/
World Allergy Organization guidelines as the occurrence,
for 6 weeks or longer, of itchy hives (wheals), angioedema,
or both, due to known or unknown causes [1].

At any one time, up to | % of the population have
chronic urticaria [2], and CSU represents approximately
two thirds of these cases [3]. Published data quantifying the
burden of the condition are limited [4] but indicate that
chronic urticaria can have a substantial impact on patients’
health-related quality of life (HRQoL), their ability to
perform daily tasks and their mental health [1, 5, 6].

The activity of CSU is assessed by evaluating the signs
(hives) and symptoms (itch) of the disease with a daily
diary of the Urticaria Activity Score (UAS). Daily average
UAS scores over 7 days are summed to a weekly UAS7
score. Changes in UAS7 scores provide a good measure of
treatment efficacy, and improvements in UAS7 scores are
reflected in significant improvements in HRQoL [7].

The use of the generic, preference-based EQ-5D
instrument for measuring health utilities in economic
evaluations is well understood. Within this study, the threelevel version of the EQ-5D was used [8], which generates

4 Adis

E. Hawe et al.

243 health states valued by the general population using the
time trade-off method [9]; a five-level version has since
been developed [10] but was not available when the data
for these analyses were collected.

To our knowledge, there is no published information on
the relationship between health states based on disease
activity [11] and utility values in patients with CSU. The
objective of the current study was to investigate the relationship between disease activity levels and the associated
utility estimates in CSU, as derived from the EQ-5D, and to
provide suitable utility value estimates for use in economic
models.

2 Methods
2.1 Data

For the present analyses, patient-level data came from three
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3
clinical trials of omalizumab for the treatment of patients
with CSU with inadequate control from the standard of
care: ASTERIA I (N = 318) [12], ASTERIA II (N = 322)
[13] and GLACIAL (N = 335) [14]. Treatment was
administered once every 4 weeks for 24 weeks in the
ASTERIA I and GLACIAL trials, and once every 4 weeks
for 12 weeks in the ASTERIA II trial. All three trials had a
follow-up period of 16 weeks with no active treatment (see
Fig. A-1 and Table A-1 in the Electronic Supplementary
Material).

2.2 Measures

The UAS is a validated daily diary [15], which has two
components: the itch severity score and the hives score.
Patients filled in the diary twice daily over the entire period
of the trials. The UAS7 is a weekly composite score,
derived by summing daily average UAS scores over
7 days. The UAS7 is used to determine disease activity and
response to treatment [1]. UAS7 scores range from 0 to 42,
with higher scores reflecting greater urticaria activity (more
severe itch and a larger number of hives). The UAS7 was
selected as the primary endpoint for this analysis because it
covers the key symptoms and signs of the disease.

UAS7 scores from the three trials were categorized into
five urticaria health states: urticaria free (UAS7 = 0), wellcontrolled urticaria (UAS7 = 1-6), mild urticaria
(UAS7 = 7-15), moderate urticaria (UAS7 = 16-27) and
severe urticaria (UAS7 = 28-42) [11]. Two of these health
states (urticaria free and well-controlled urticaria) were
endpoints for the clinical trials. Patients were required to
have a UAS7 score of 16 or higher to be included in the
trial, and this was considered by medical experts and
EQ-S5D Utilities in Chronic Urticaria

regulatory agencies as the threshold of moderate to severe
urticaria, therefore a score of 16 was considered the lower
threshold of the moderate urticaria health state. In addition,
on the basis of clinical expertise, a score of 28 or higher
was considered severe for reimbursement purposes and by
the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
[16]. Thus, the remaining UAS7 scores (7-15) were used to
define the mild urticaria health state. UAS7 scores for
every week were available, but scores reported in the 7
days prior to baseline and every study visit were used in the
analysis. Study visits were conducted every 4 weeks after
baseline until week 40 in the ASTERIA I and GLACIAL
trials and until week 28 in the ASTERIA II trial.

The EQ-SD is a generic, standardized instrument used as
a measure of health outcomes across many diseases. The
measure can describe the effect of different health states on
HRQoL. It consists of five questions, each asking about a
particular dimension: mobility, self-care, usual activities,
pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression [8]. The EQ-5D
allows comparison of HRQoL across diseases and facilitates calculation of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
The version used in these three clinical trials, the EQ-5D3L, has three levels of response for each question, evaluating the respondent’s current status: no problems, some
problems or extreme problems. A single index value for
health states (called a utility) can be calculated from the
combination of responses to the five questions [9]. The
maximum utility value is 1 (perfect health), and 0 corresponds to death. In some instances, the utility can be less
than 0, indicating a health state that is considered worse
than death. As per the trial protocols, in the ASTERIA I
and GLACIAL trials, the EQ-5D data were collected at
baseline and at weeks 12 and 40; in the ASTERIA II trial,
the data were collected at baseline and at weeks 12 and 28.
The EQ-5D index score was constructed using UK population—based weights [9].

2.3 Analyses

Descriptive statistics were considered for the baseline
characteristics for each trial, including patient age and
sex, duration of CSU and other key variables. For
descriptive statistics, continuous variables were presented
as means, standard deviations (SDs) and ranges; categorical variables were presented as counts and percentages. The mean utilities were calculated for each of the
five UAS7 health states by trial and visit. There was no
imputation of missing data.

Because the analyses at the individual trial level and
individual time points resulted in inconsistent utilities, with
variability in the relationship of utilities to disease activity,
data from the individual trials and individual time points
were pooled to increase the sample size and generate more

523

reliable estimates, and mixed-effects regression models
were tested to estimate utilities. A linear mixed-effects
model was used to predict EQ-5D utilities for each UAS7
health state on the basis of pooled data from the three trials.
The validity of pooling the three trials was considered
through visual comparisons and interaction terms to assess
differences in the relationship between health states and
utilities among the three trials. Random effects for trials
and patients were included, along with the following
covariates as fixed effects: UAS7 health state at baseline
(moderate or severe), presence of angioedema at baseline
and during follow-up (a binary variable indicating the
presence of 1 or more days with angioedema in the 7 days
prior to each of the visits included in the model), duration
of CSU, number of previous CSU medications, visit,
treatment, and patient age and sex (see Eq. A-1 in the
Electronic Supplementary Material). Interaction terms
between the duration of CSU and the UAS7 health state
and between the presence of angioedema and the UAS7
health state also were considered in the models.

A parsimonious model was selected using an elimination stepwise procedure—a combination of backwards
elimination, in which covariates that were not significant
were sequentially removed from the model according to
their P values (P < 0.05), and forward inclusion, in which
those variables that had been previously removed were
considered for inclusion on the basis of their P values. The
UAS7 health state was forced into the model to ensure it
was always a predictor. The results of the models with
nonsignificant covariates are not shown, as those models
were an intermediate step. Consistency was observed in the
selection of variables on the basis of their significance
across the sensitivity analysis and primary analysis. No
significant evidence was found that those variables that
were not retained in the final model were predictive of
utilities. The model fit was examined by comparing margins over visits, health state, presence of angioedema and
trial against the observed values. Margins, or marginal
effects, are post-estimation statistics calculated from predictions of a previously fit overall model. Margins were
compared with observed group values across visit, health
state and trial (because of small subgroups across all
covariates). Margins were plotted against a line of best fit.

The primary analysis considered angioedema in the
7 days prior to the EQ-5D utility value. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted, which considered the covariates
angioedema at baseline and angioedema between 4 and
12 weeks (the latter was a secondary efficacy endpoint of
the studies) with and without the 28-week data from
ASTERIA IL.

Further sensitivity analyses were conducted to confirm
the robustness of the results by evaluating the impact on
utilities of including covariates that were not significant in

4 Adis
524

one model but were significant in alternative models. This
allowed evaluation of the stability of the utility estimates.

In addition, subgroup analysis was conducted to further
explore possible differences in the relationship between
UAS7 health state and utilities in (1) those patients who
had angioedema at baseline and those who did not;
(2) those patients who had angioedema at any time during
follow-up and those who did not (regardless of their
baseline angioedema status); and (3) those patients who
were in the severe health state (UAS7 28-42) at baseline
and those who were in the moderate health state at baseline
(UAS7 16-27).

All analyses were performed using Stata 13 software
(StataCorp; College Station, TX, USA).

3 Results

The baseline characteristics of patients in the ASTERIA I
(N = 318), ASTERIA Il (N = 322) and GLACIAL
(N = 335) trials were consistent, with similar age distributions, sex distributions and durations of CSU (Table 1).
The mean (SD) UAS7 scores ranged from 30.7 (6.8) to
31.1 (6.6), and the mean (SD) EQ-5D score ranged from
0.68 (0.27) to 0.73 (0.24).

Calculation of utilities for each UAS7 health state
revealed inconsistent utilities for individual treatment arms
and at individual time points, with improved response not
always equating to an increase in the utility. For example,
at 12 weeks in GLACIAL, the utilities for those who were

severe at baseline were 0.9 for those with mild urticaria and
0.86 for those with well-controlled urticaria (see
Tables A-3, A-4 and A-S in the Electronic Supplementary
Material). This was likely due to the very small numbers of
patients in each UAS7 health state.

Pooling of trials to increase the overall sample size,
examining utilities across all visits and taking into account
angioedema at any point in the trial resulted in more
consistent utilities for each health state. The final model
(see Table A-2 in the Electronic Supplementary Material)
included only the significant covariates of the assessment
point (visit) in the trial and angioedema in the 7 days prior
to the visit; study and patient were included as random
effects. In the pooled analyses of all trials, treatment arms
and time points (Fig. 1), patients with greater CSU activity
were observed to have lower EQ-5D utilities (0.710 for
severe urticaria, 0.780 for moderate urticaria, 0.829 for
mild urticaria, 0.862 for well-controlled urticaria and 0.894
for urticaria free), and with each improved UAS7 health
state, there was an incremental increase in the utility. A
comparison of the predicted values with the observed data
did not suggest any issues with the model fit and indicated
that the model accurately predicted the underlying data (see
Figs. A-2 and A-3 in the Electronic Supplementary
Material).

All comparisons between EQ-SD utility values, except
for well-controlled urticaria versus urticaria free and for
well-controlled urticaria versus mild urticaria, showed
significant differences between health states at P < 0.005.

As seen in the primary analysis of all patients and all
time points, consistent utilities were observed in the sensitivity analyses (Table 2); patients with more severe CSU
had lower EQ-SD utilities; and with each improved UAS7

health state, there was an incremental increase in the utility. Sensitivity analysis 1, which also included angioedema
between weeks 4 and 12 as a covariate and omitted
28-week data from ASTERIA II, provided very similar
results, typically differing only at the third decimal place
(Table 2). This also was true for sensitivity analysis 2,
which considered all time points and also included
angioedema between weeks 4 and 12 as a covariate
(Table 2).

The results of the subgroup analyses showed a pattern similar to those of the primary and sensitivity
analyses, with EQ-5D utilities increasing with decreasing urticaria activity in all subgroups (Table 3). Overall,
the presence of angioedema at both baseline and during
follow-up decreased utility in all health states, with the
exception of angioedema during follow-up in patients
with mild and well-controlled urticaria. The utilities of
each health state were similar whether the angioedema
was present at baseline or during follow-up. While the
interaction between the health state and angioedema on
utilities was not significant, the largest impact of the
presence of angioedema was observed in the severe
health state. Similarly, greater CSU activity at baseline
decreased the overall utility in the majority of health
states.

4 Discussion and Conclusion

The results presented here demonstrate that when sample
sizes are sufficient (that is, by pooling of trials, treatment
arms and time points), consistent EQ-5D utilities for differing levels of disease activity can be obtained. Thus, in
contrast to analyses that have focused on treatment arms
within a single trial, the pooled trial and treatment arm
analyses demonstrated that EQ-5D utilities increase with
decreasing urticaria activity. The robustness of the results
was confirmed by the sensitivity and subgroup analyses.
When the presence of angioedema 7 days prior to a visit
was examined at various time points, there were some
slight changes in utilities but the general pattern held: the
better the CSU health state, as measured by the UAS7, the
greater the EQ-5D utility, indicating a greater preference
for less active CSU health states. This pattern was also
demonstrated in the subgroup analyses. Overall, lower
utilities were generally seen in each health state with
greater baseline disease activity and in the presence of
angioedema.

These analyses document an evaluation of utilities
associated with the activity of CSU. The clinical impact of
CSU, especially on patients’ HRQoL, is immense,
demonstrated particularly by lower physical and mental
components scores on the SF-36 and higher rates of

depression, anxiety and sleep difficulties in patients with
CSU than in those without the disease [4]. In addition,
evaluation of EQ-5D utility scores is of great importance,
as it allows comparison of HRQoL across diseases and
enables calculation of QALYs, which are used in economic
models. QALYs are essential components of health technology assessments, which support decision making in
health care resource allocation.

As with any study, there were potential limitations to
this work. First, the version of the EQ-5D used in these
three clinical trials was the EQ-5D-3L, and there may be
some question about whether it is sensitive enough to
capture differences between patients’ preferences for one
health state versus another. The five CSU health states
showed consistent differences in utilities, and so for each
successively improved CSU health state, the EQ-5D utility
increased from one health state to another—by between 3
and 9 % in the final model. However, sensitivity often is a
criticism of the EQ-5D-3L. While there was a clear relationship between the CSU health state and EQ-5D utility in

4 Adis

the present case, it is possible that the EQ-5D-3L may not
be sufficiently sensitive to capture the full impact of
CSU—for example, for patients in the severe UAS7 health
state, the utility was 0.710, which may be higher than
would be expected for this subgroup. The recently developed EQ-5D-5L [10] provides measurement properties
superior to those of the EQ-5D-3L. The second limitation
was that the EQ-5D scores were calculated on observed
data. The results may not completely reflect the health
utilities of all trial patients, particularly those with more
severe disease activity.

A third potential question can be raised about the
validity of the CSU health states themselves. However,
other work [7, 11] has shown that the five health states, as
defined here in our models, can discriminate significantly
between patients in terms of their Dermatology Life
Quality Index scores, sleep interference and interference
with daily activities. Thus, any concerns about the validity
of these health states should be minimal. Further validation
work is ongoing.
EQ-S5D Utilities in Chronic Urticaria

It is essential that health economic researchers and
health technology assessment bodies have the latest information in order to determine the cost effectiveness of
treatments. In the present case, we now have important
information that can assist in determination of the cost
effectiveness of CSU treatments and can aid decision
makers in their consideration of the reimbursement for
such treatments.

The results of these analyses document the utility
associated with the severity of CSU health states and
suggest that the EQ-5D utility score increases with
decreased disease activity. Overall, lower utilities were
generally seen in each health state with greater baseline
disease activity and in the presence of angioedema.
