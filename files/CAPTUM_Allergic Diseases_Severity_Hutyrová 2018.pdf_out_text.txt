Introduction: Omalizumab is indicated for the treatment of severe allergic asthma (SAA) and chronic spontaneous
urticaria, although a number of studies have confirmed the effectiveness of this therapy also for other IgE-mediated
diseases.

Aim: To assess the impact of anti-lgE therapy on SAA and comorbid IgE-mediated allergic diseases in patients
treated with omalizumab for SAA enrolled in the CAR (Czech Anti-IgE Registry).

Material and methods: Three hundred and ten patients with SAA treated with omalizumab were enrolled in the
CAR. Two hundred and twenty-nine individuals were evaluated after 12 months of omalizumab treatment for
asthma control test (ACT), examination of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), forced expiratory volume in 1s

(FEV,), the use of systemic corticosteroids, side effects of treatment and clinical effect of omalizumab on allergic
comorbidities (allergic rhinitis, chronic urticaria, atopic dermatitis and food allergy).

Results: After 12 months of treatment with omalizumab, patients experienced a significant improvement of ACT
and FEV, reduction of FENO, use of systemic corticosteroids for asthma exacerbations and dose of maintenance
oral corticosteroid therapy. The positive effect of treatment with omalizumab was observed in 82.2% of patients
with allergic rhinitis, in 85.7% of patients with chronic urticaria, in 82.1% of patients with atopic dermatitis, and in

67.3% of patients with food allergy.

Conclusions: In the CAR registry, patients with SAA treated with omalizumab showed a significant positive effect
of anti-lgE therapy not only on the asthma control, but also on allergic comorbidities.

Introduction

Omalizumab (Novartis, Switzerland; Genentech, USA)
is a recombinant humanised lgG1 monoclonal antibody
that selectively binds to the CH3 domain of free immunoglobulin E (IgE) and prevents it from binding to the
high affinity receptor FceRI on the cell membrane of mast
cells, basophils and antigen presenting cells [1, 2]. This
leads to reduction in free serum IgE, down-regulation of
FceRI on the cell membrane of key inflammatory cells
with a consequent blockade of the allergic cascade, antigen presentation to T-lymphocytes, production of Th2
cytokines and other mediators, reduction in the number
of eosinophils in peripheral blood and tissues [1, 2]. These

 

mechanisms ultimately reduce a pathological allergic immune response and inflammation.

Omalizumab is indicated for treatment of severe allergic asthma (SAA) and chronic spontaneous urticaria,
but several studies confirm a positive effect of this therapy also on other IgE-mediated allergic diseases [3, 4].
The use of omalizumab in the treatment of other allergic
diseases is still considered to be an off-label therapy.

Aim
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of

anti-lgE therapy with omalizumab on SAA and other allergic comorbidities (allergic rhinitis, chronic urticaria,

atopic dermatitis, food allergy) in the group of patients
treated with omalizumab for SAA.

Material and methods
Patients

Three hundred and ten patients with SAA treated
with omalizumab as a part of a normal clinical practice were enrolled in the Czech Anti-IgE Registry (CAR)
in 10 specialized centers in the Czech Republic between
2006 and 2015. The study was designed as a retrospective-prospective, multicenter, non-interventional, observational study. The patients, enrolled in the CAR, were
retrospectively evaluated for clinical conditions in the last
year before the initiation of the omalizumab therapy. All
patients fulfilled GINA criteria for severe asthma, their
asthma was classified as allergic with proven allergy to
perennial airborne allergens, and had = 2 moderate to
severe asthma exacerbations in the last year before the
initiation of the omalizumab treatment [5]. The patients
were evaluated by physicians after 16 weeks of treatment with omalizumab as responders or non-responders on the basis of global evaluation of asthma control.
The therapy with omalizumab was discontinued in the
non-responders.

From a total of 310 patients enrolled in the CAR, 229
individuals were evaluated after 12 months of administration of omalizumab. The following was assessed after 12 months of the treatment: asthma control (asthma
control test —- ACT™), examination of fractional exhaled
nitric oxide (FENO), forced expiratory volume in 1s
(FEV,), the use of systemic corticosteroids (maintenance
treatment and bursts of corticosteroids due to asthma
exacerbations), side effects of the treatment and clinical effect of omalizumab on allergic comorbidities (allergic rhinitis, chronic urticaria, atopic dermatitis and
food allergy). Evaluation of comorbidities has been carried out on the basis of history and subjective assessment of the patient’s physician. The course of disease
was assessed by four categories: 1) free of symptoms,
2) improvement, 3) no change, and 4) worsening of
symptoms. Not all of the followed parameters were
available in all patients.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Statistical analysis

Categorical variables are described by an absolute
and relative frequency in the groups of patients. For the
description of the continuous variables, methods of descriptive statistics with calculation of average, median
and range (minimum—maximum) were used. The Wilcoxon paired test was used for a comparison of continuous
variables. The level of statistical significance was considered to be p < 0.05. The analysis was performed by
the statistical program SPSS 22.0.0 (IBM Corporation,
2013).

Results
Patient baseline characteristics

A total of 310 patients were enrolled in the study. Overall, 187 (60.3%) patients were women and 123 (39.7%)
patients were men. The average age of the patients at
baseline was 44 years (median: 43 years, range: 8-78
years). The average value of total IgE levels was 350 IU/
ml, median 239 IU/ml and range 16-2303 IU/ml. Two hundred and twenty-eight patients (75.0%, n = 304) received
maintenance oral corticosteroid (OCS) therapy, and the average daily OCS dose (prednisone) was 10.2 mg (median:
5 mg, range: 0-100 mg) at baseline. The patients were
dosed 150-1200 mg/month of omalizumab according to
heir weight and IgE levels. The mean values of FEV, were
66% (median: 67%, range: 10-120%, n = 309) at baseline.
Distribution of FEV, values among patients was the following: > 80% — 60 (19.4%) patients, 60-80% — 140 (45.3%) paients, 40-60% — 77 (24.9%) patients, < 40% — 32 (10.4%)
patients. Baseline FENO values were available in 221 individuals with mean 51 ppb, median 37 ppb and range
0-290 ppb. There were measured FENO values = 25 ppb
in 80 (36.2%) patients, 25-50 ppb in 62 (28.1%) patients,
51-75 ppb in 34 (15.4%) patients, 76-100 ppb in 14 (6.3%)
atients, and > 100 ppb in 31 (14.0%) patients. The mean
ACT was 12 points (median: 12 points, range: 5-24) at
aseline (n = 295). Initially, in 269 (86.8%) patients alergic rhinitis, in 86 (27.7%) patients atopic dermatitis, in
81 (26.1%) patients food allergy, and in 17 (5.5%) patients
chronic urticaria were reported (n = 310).

 

 

 

 

Effect of omalizumab on asthma

From a total of 310 patients enrolled, 52 (16.7%) paients discontinued the therapy after 16 weeks because
ey were identified as non-responders by their physicians. The values of ACT, FEV, and FENO at baseline and
2 months after the initiation of omalizumab therapy are
resented in Table 1. After 12 months of treatment with

malizumab, a significant improvement in ACT score,
FENO, FEV, versus baseline was seen. A statistically
significant reduction in the use of systemic corticosteroids for asthma exacerbation was found from baseline
0 month 12 (p < 0.001) (Figure 1). After 12 months of
e omalizumab treatment, a daily OCS dose was significantly decreased (mean 5 mg, median O mg, range:
0-65 mg after 12 months vs. mean 10.2 mg, median
5 mg, range: 0-100 mg at baseline, n = 224, p < 0.001).
inety-two (41.1%) patients discontinued OCS treatment
during 12 months of omalizumab therapy.

Adverse effects of omalizumab

Adverse events occurred in 38 (12.9%, n = 295) and 16
(7.0%, n = 229) patients after 4 and 12 months of therapy, respectively. The most common adverse effects were
headache, nausea, dysphonia, fatigue, weight gain and
paresthesia. In 11 (3.5%) patients, adverse effects resulted in discontinuation of therapy with omalizumab. There
were no serious adverse events.

Discussion

In the present study we have evaluated the effect of
omalizumab in patients with severe allergic asthma included in the CAR registry after 12 months of treatment.
It is a well-documented fact that treatment with anti-IgE
monoclonal antibody provides significant benefits for patients with SAA [6]. This treatment significantly improves
symptoms and quality of life, it reduces the rate of asthma exacerbations, asthma hospitalizations and doses of
systemic and inhaled corticosteroids [7]. The results of
this study have confirmed a significant improvement of
asthma control (measured by ACT) and respiratory functions (FEV,), significant decrease of FENO and overall use
of systemic corticosteroids (maintenance corticosteroid
treatment and corticosteroid bursts due to asthma exacerbations) after 12 months of treatment with omalizumab. The therapy with omalizumab was discontinued
in 16.7% of enrolled patients, who were identified as

non-responders by their physicians after 16 weeks of
treatment. The therapy was well tolerated and only in
3.5% of patients the treatment was terminated due to
adverse effects.

Apart from assessing the asthma control, we have
also focused on the effect of omalizumab on comorbidties of allergic etiology — allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, food allergy and chronic urticaria. Omalizumab is
nowadays approved also for the treatment of chronic
spontaneous urticaria, but the effectiveness of omalizumab has also been studied in other diseases [4, 7].
The most common comorbidity in our group of SAA patients was allergic rhinitis present in 86.8% of individuals. The positive effect of treatment with omalizumab
was observed in 82.2% of patients with allergic rhinitis
after 12 months of therapy (improvement in 63.5% of
patients, complete remission in 18.7% of patients). The
ficacy of omalizumab on allergic rhinitis has been
shown in numerous studies. Meta-analysis of 11 studies
involving 2,870 patients with moderate-to-severe allergic rhinitis, who were treated with omalizumab due to
an inadequate compensation of the disease despite the
standard treatment, showed a statistically significant reduction in the daily nasal symptom severity score (-0.67,
p < 0.0001), in daily nasal rescue medication score and
improvement of quality of life [8].
In patients with severe asthma and periodic allergic
rhinitis treated with omalizumab, there has been shown
a reduction of symptoms (nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea,
ching, sneezing), resolution of turbinate hypertrophy,
reduction or elimination of symptomatic drug use [9].
Series of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
(RDBPC) multicenter studies have shown that the combination of allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) with
omalizumab significantly improves the tolerance, safety
and efficacy of SIT in patients with allergic rhinitis and
asthma [1, 10, 11].

Other comorbidities, followed in patients enrolled in
the CAR registry, were chronic urticaria and atopic dermatitis. In our patients with SAA and chronic urticaria, efficacy of omalizumab after 12 months of treatment was seen
in 85.7% of patients (improvement in 50% of patients,
complete resolution in 35.7% of patients), which corresponds with the literature data. Chronic spontaneous
urticaria is the only skin disease, for which omalizumab
therapy is currently approved. The effectiveness of antiIgE therapy for this diagnosis has been demonstrated in
several RDBPC studies involving almost 1,200 patients
[12, 13]. In these studies, different doses of omalizumab ranging from 75 mg to 600 mg with treatment duration up to 24 weeks were examined. 300 mg of omalizumab administered every 4 weeks has shown to be the
most effective and it resulted in a significant reduction
of symptoms (pruritus), number of urticarial wheals, it
improved the quality of life of patients and decreased the
dose of antihistamines. Complete resolution of urticaria

was reported in 34-44% of patients, complete or nearly
complete resolution of the symptoms was observed in
52-66% of patients treated with 300 mg of omalizumab every 4 weeks [12].

The role of omalizumab in the treatment of atopic
dermatitis is not as clear as in chronic spontaneous urticaria. Although atopic dermatitis is associated with high
serum IgE levels, the role of IgE in pathogenesis of this
disease has not been completely explained. Atopic dermatitis occurs even in patients without any evidence of
atopy, in which non-lgE-mediated pathogenetic mechanisms occur. In our patients from the CAR registry, an imrovement of atopic dermatitis was reported in 46.3% of
atients and 35.8% of patients had no symptoms of skin
disease after 12 months of treatment with omalizumab
(overall positive effect in 82.1% of patients). Published
studies with anti-IgE treatment in atopic dermatitis reorted ambivalent results. Some of them have shown
he benefit of treatment with omalizumab in atopic dermatitis [14-16], while others have not confirmed its eficacy [17, 18]. Our data are similar to results of a recen
meta-analysis of 26 studies encompassing 174 patients
with atopic dermatitis. This meta-analysis reported positive clinical effects of omalizumab ranging from mild
improvement to complete remission in 74.1% of patients
19]. Another meta-analysis of 15 studies investigating the
effect of omalizumab in atopic dermatitis discovered an
excellent clinical response in 43% of patients, 27.2% had
a satisfactory response and in 30.1% of patients there
were no changes or symptoms worsened [20]. Multivariate logistic regression showed that an excellent clinica
response was significantly associated with serum IgE
levels of less than 700 IU/ml compared to patients with
igh serum IgE concentrations. A possible reason for the
ailure of anti-lgE therapy in these studies is the low dose
of omalizumab that “inactivates” the IgE by immune comlex formation and depends on the ratio of molecules
of omalizumab and IgE [20, 21]. A new approach in the
reatment of atopic dermatitis with very high IgE serum
levels could therefore be a combination of extracorporeal IgE immunoadsorption with anti-lgE monoclonal antibody [21]. This treatment was applied in the study of Zink
et al. in 10 patients with severe atopic dermatitis with
serum IgE > 3500 kU/L. Patients underwent the immunoadsorption within 2 to 4 consecutive days, depending on
he baseline level of total IgE, followed by an adminisration of 450 mg of omalizumab every 2 weeks for 24
weeks. In all patients, the levels of free IgE decreased
with the improvement of symptom severity score [21].
Another reason for lack of efficacy of therapy with omalizumab in atopic dermatitis might be complex immune
dysregulation caused by non-lgE-mediated pathogenic
mechanisms. Patients with the primary disorder of the
skin barrier with filaggrin gene mutations are less likely to
benefit from treatment with omalizumab compared with
patients with mutations in other genes [22].

From all the allergic comorbidities in our SAA patients,
the least efficacy of omalizumab therapy was observed in
patients with food allergy. Positive effects of omalizumab
were seen in 67.3% of patients after 12 months of treatment. 27.6% of patients reported improvement and 39.7%
of patients had complete remission of symptoms of food
allergy. In comparison with other monitored diseases, there was the highest proportion of individuals (31%)
with no change in symptoms during treatment with omalizumab in patients with food allergy. A possible explanation
could be the ineffectiveness of omalizumab with food allergy mediated by non-lgE mechanisms. So far no effective treatment of food allergies was available except for
elimination diet and symptomatic treatment of allergic reactions. In recent years, the possibility of using oral immunotherapy (OIT) to achieve tolerance to food allergens was
studied [23-27]. Omalizumab is one of the most promising
adjunctive therapies for food allergy. The allergens studied
in omalizumab-enabled OIT trials include peanuts, cow’s
milk, eggs, or mixes of multiple foods [25]. Results from
several studies suggest that omalizumab allows the use
of more efficient rapid dose-escalation protocols for OIT.
Omalizumab reduces the frequency and severity of adverse reactions induced by OIT, and increases the allergen
tolerance threshold [25-27].

 

 

Conclusions

 

 

Data from the Czech Anti-IgE Registry confirm the “real-life experience” from other countries with omalizumab
treatment in patients with SAA. In the present study, a significant improvement in asthma control, lung functions,
reduction of exacerbations and overall use of systemic
corticosteroid were demonstrated after 12 months of
omalizumab treatment. Furthermore, positive effects of
omalizumab have been proven on allergic comorbidities in
the majority of patients with SAA. Most patients with allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, chronic urticaria and food
allergy experienced improvement or complete remission
of symptoms of these diseases. Except for SAA and chronic
spontaneous urticaria, the use of omalizumab in the treatment of other allergic diseases is still considered off-label
therapy. Patients with severe forms of other allergic diseases, inadequately controlled with standard therapies,
may also significantly benefit from omalizumab treatment.
Therefore, it is necessary to verify the efficacy of omalizumab in further RDBPC studies with larger groups of patients with allergic diseases. As the results are ambiguous
in some disorders, defining subgroups of responders and
finding predictors of therapeutic response to omalizumab
may be useful in these diseases.
