The burden of chronic urticaria:
French baseline data from the international
real-life AWARE study

Background: The AWARE study is an ongoing international study of
patients with chronic urticaria refractory to H1-antihistamines. The aim
of this study is to evaluate the burden of disease and the use of healthcare
resources in real-life conditions. Objectives: To analyse the baseline data
of French patients included in the AWARE study. Materials & Methods:
AWARE is a prospective, non-interventional, international study that
includes adult patients who have had chronic urticaria, refractory to at
least one H1-antihistamine, for at least two months. Results: Ninety-four
patients (mean age: 47.9 years; 71.3% women) with chronic urticaria
(50.0% spontaneous only, 9.6% inducible only, and 40.4% both) were
included in French centres. The median duration from diagnosis was
three years and angioedema was present in 31.5% of patients for the
past six months. In 63.8% of cases, the patients received at least one
treatment for urticaria (H1-antihistamine for 66.0%). Chronic urticaria
was poorly controlled (UCT score <12) in 88.9% of patients and quality of life was severely impaired (mean DLQI score: 8.6). The use of
healthcare resources was significant with frequent visits to general practitioners (80.8% of patients; mean: 8.1 visits). However, more than half
of patients had not previously consulted a dermatologist. Conclusion:
These baseline data of French patients in the AWARE study show that
patients suffering from chronic urticaria, refractory to H1-antihistamines
for a median of three years, are insufficiently treated and that their quality of life is impaired. Despite the significant use of healthcare resources,
access to specialised consultations remains insufficient.

Key words: chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic inducible urticaria,
angioedema, H1-antihistamines, quality of life

The impact of chronic urticaria on patient quality of life and
healthcare consumption has been reported in many studies
[2, 11-15]. However, these data were obtained from spe
more than six weeks [1]. Based on recent European studies, the prevalence of chronic urticaria is reported to be
0.5-1% [2]. The wheals are associated with angioedema in
33% to 55% of patients [3-7]. Angioedema can sometimes
be painful [8].
Chronic urticaria can be spontaneous (due to unknown
causes), induced by physical triggers (e.g. cholinergic,
cold, heat, delayed-pressure, solar, and dermographic
urticaria) or occur after contact through immunological
or non-immunological mechanisms [9]. Spontaneous and
inducible urticaria can coexist in the same patient [8].

In order to control the symptoms of chronic urticaria,
international guidelines published in 2014 recommend, as
first-line treatment, the use of an oral second-generation
(non-sedating) H1-antihistamine at licensed doses [1, 10].
If the response is insufficient within two weeks, the doses
can be increased up to four times. If the response remains
inadequate after an additional one to four weeks, additional
treatment with montelukast, omalizumab or cyclosporine is
recommended [1].

cialised centres whose patients were frequently severely
ill, thus limiting the interpretation of results. The burden
of chronic urticaria remains unknown due to the lack of
real-life data. The AWARE (A World-wide AntihistamineRefractory chronic urticaria patient Evaluation) study is
an international study designed to prospectively evaluate
disease burden, treatment schedules, and use of clinical
resources for patients with chronic urticaria refractory to
H1-antihistamine. Here, we report the baseline data of the
patients included in the French centres.

Patients and methods
Type of study and objectives

AWARE is an international (12 European countries) noninterventional study that includes adult patients (> 18 years)
with a confirmed diagnosis of chronic urticaria (for at
least two months), which is refractory to at least one H1antihistamine.

At the inclusion visit, a retrospective record of data from
the previous 12 months was documented and a prospective
two-year follow-up was subsequently initiated.

Before inclusion in the study, the patients received from
the physician written information on the objective of the
study and the conditions for participation. Written informed
consent was obtained from each patient.

The primary objective of the study is to correlate patientreported outcomes (recorded prospectively) with the
different therapeutic options that have been prescribed. The
objective of the interim analysis reported in the present article is to document patient characteristics, pharmacological
treatments, burden of chronic urticaria, and consumption of
healthcare resources in the French cohort.

Data collected and patient-related outcome

Data recorded at the initial visit (upon inclusion in the study)
included demographics, history, and characteristics of the
disease (time of diagnosis, type of chronic urticaria, presence and duration of angioedema, presence and duration of
wheals, comorbidities, pharmacological treatment, and utilisation of healthcare resources related to chronic urticaria
during the previous year).

Questionnaires assessing both the impact on quality of life
and disease activity were completed at each visit in order
to evaluate:

 

— Patient satisfaction with current treatment using a visual
analogue scale (VAS) graded from 0 (not at all satisfied) to
10 (very satisfied).

— The control of urticaria (over the last four weeks) using
the Urticaria Control Test (UCT); a retrospective four-item
questionnaire. The total score varies from 0 (uncontrolled
disease) to 16 (completely controlled disease).

— Patient quality of life using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI); a 10-item questionnaire that evaluates
the impact of a skin disease on daily life over the last seven
days according to different domains (Symptoms and Feelings, Daily activities, Leisure, Work and School, Personal
relationships, and Treatment). The total score varies from 0
(no effect at all on patient life) to 30 (extremely large effect
on patient life).

— The quality of life in patients with angioedema using
the Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (AE-QoL).
This includes 17 questions covering four domains (Function, Fatigue/Mood, Fears/Shame, and Nutrition). The score
for each domain and the total score vary from 0 (no impairment of quality of life) to 100 (maximal alteration of quality
of life).

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was only descriptive and no hypothesis
was tested. Data were analysed using SAS software version
9.2 (SAS Institute; Cary, North Carolina, USA).

included in 25 French centres (following consultation with
15 hospital dermatologists for chronic urticaria and 10 private practice dermatologists) from February 2015 to July
2015. All patients met the selection criteria.

The mean age of patients was 47.9 years and 71.3% were
women (fable 1). The median duration of the disease from
diagnosis was three years; 50.0% of patients had spontaneous urticaria only, 9.6% had inducible urticaria only, and
40.4% had both.

Wheals were present within the last six months in 78.9%
of patients and for most patients (80.3%), their individual
duration did not exceed 24 hours (table 1). Angioedema was
present within the last six months in 31.5% of cases with
a mean total duration of 23.8 days; intensity was severe in
17.9% of patients, moderate in 50.0%, slight in 25.0%, and
negligible in 7.1%.

The most frequent types of inducible chronic urticaria were
dermographism (26.6%) and delayed-pressure urticaria
(16.0%) (table 2).

The most frequent comorbidities were allergic rhinitis (19.1%), arterial hypertension (12.8%), and anxiety
(11.7%) (figure 1).

Drug regimens and utilisation
of healthcare resources

Sixty out of 94 patients (63.8%) were receiving at
least one treatment for urticaria at the inclusion visit.
The most frequent treatments were non-sedating H1antihistamines (66.0%), montelukast (12.8%), and sedating
H1-antihistamines (10.8%) (figure 2).

Between the onset of symptoms and the inclusion visit,
80.8% of patients visited a general practitioner, with a mean
of 8.1 visits (table 3). About a quarter of patients were
admitted to an emergency department (with a mean of 3.6
admissions). Only 43.8% of patients visited a dermatologist
or an allergologist, and 24.7% visited a specialised urticaria
centre.

The burden of disease: disease severity
and quality of life
The mean (SD) UCT score was 6.4 (3.6) and 88.9% of

patients had an UCT score < 12, indicating insufficiently
controlled urticaria for most patients (table 4). These results

EJD, vol. 29, n° 1, January-February 2019

are consistent with the mean score of satisfaction with the
treatment assessed using the VAS that was only 4.7 (10
being maximal satisfaction).
The mean DLQI score was 8.6 with a “moderate effect on
patient life” (score: 6-10) for 31.8% of patients, a “very
large effect on patient life” (score: 11-20) for 33.0%, and
n “extremely large effect on patient life” (score: 21-30)
for 2.3% [16]. In patients with angioedema, the domains,
Fatigue/Mood and Fears/Shame (questionnaire AE-QoL),
were the most impaired due to angioedema symptoms
(table 4).
Sick leave related to urticaria was reported in 11.0% of
patients (with a mean duration of 2.2 weeks).

Discussion

Once fully analysed, the prospective international AWARE
study will provide us with valuable real-life data on H1antihistamine-refractory chronic urticaria. These data will
help us to correlate the evolution of chronic urticaria with
the different treatments. The interim analyses reported in

this article relate to baseline data of the French cohort. Inclusion criteria were not restrictive, allowing an overview of the
characteristics of chronic urticaria, its impact on quality of
life, therapeutic management, and utilisation of healthcare
resources.

The baseline characteristics of the French patients are consistent with the data from other studies [2-7, 10, 12, 17] as
well as baseline characteristics of the German and Scandinavian patients of the AWARE study [18, 19]. Our patients
had a mean age of 47.9 years and there was a majority of
women (71.3%); the median BMI (close to 25 kg/m?) indicates that a large proportion of patients were overweight.
In the German and Scandinavian patients of the AWARE
study, 20.2% and 24.0% had chronic urticaria that was

52 —

both spontaneous and inducible, respectively [18, 19]. In
our cohort, this percentage was higher, with 40.4% of the
French patients showing an association with both types of
chronic urticaria.

Angioedema frequently has a negative impact on patient
quality of life because of the associated pain and alteration of physical appearance [20]. Moreover, the anxiety
resulting from angioedema frequently leads to admission to
an emergency department where this disorder is often illdiagnosed. Based on our analysis, angioedema was reported
in about a third of patients, which is comparable to the
results of the German and Scandinavian patients of the
AWARE study (46.1% and 32.9%, respectively) [18, 19],
as well as other studies in which angioedema rates varied

EJD, vol. 29, n° 1, January-February 2019
from 33% to 55% [3-7]. In French patients, angioedema
appeared to negatively impact quality of life, as assessed
by the AE-QoL score, more particularly for the domains,
Fatigue/Mood and Fears/Shame.

Chronic urticaria is frequently associated with atopic disorders (asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis)
or auto-immune diseases [3, 21-23]. Thus, some studies
have reported that up to 40-50% of patients with chronic
urticaria also had allergic rhinitis [21, 22], whereas only
19.1% of our patients reported allergic rhinitis (18.2%
of the German patients and 16.5% of the Scandinavian
patients of the AWARE study). These results are comparable to the prevalence of allergic rhinitis in the French
adult population and do not suggest an increased prevalence in this cohort [24]. Due to the low sample size, the
results for the other allergic and auto-immune disorders
are only described descriptively. However, the prevalence
of asthma in the French patients (3.2%) is lower than that
in the German (12.0%) and Scandinavian patients (19.6%)
[18, 19].

Psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression are
classically associated with chronic urticaria; 25 to 30% of
patients suffer from anxiety and 11 to 21% from depressive disorders [2, 25-28]. In our French cohort, psychiatric
disorders were reported with lower rates; 11.7% for anxiety disorders and 3.2% for depressive disorders. Psychiatric
disorders were reported also at relatively low rates in the
German (9.5% for anxiety and 4.7% for depression) and
Scandinavian patients (3.2% and 4.4%, respectively) in
the AWARE study. According to the German authors, the
rates reported in their cohort were slightly higher than the
prevalence in the general German population [18]. However, it is difficult to draw any conclusions because the
prevalence of psychiatric disorders is highly dependent on
definition and methods of evaluation. Thus, the AWARE
study did not include psychometric scales for the measure
of anxiety and depression, but relied only on reports from
patients and dermatologists within a non-interventional
setting.

At the inclusion visit, only 63.8% of patients were receiving pharmacological treatment for urticaria and half of them
were taking non-sedating H1-antihistamines. Dose escalation of antihistamines and treatment combinations were not
analysed in this baseline report and will be further analysed
during the prospective follow-up phase.

Chronic urticaria was insufficiently controlled in almost
nine patients out of 10 (88.9% with UCT <12) and patient
satisfaction with the treatment was low (4.7 on the VAS
scale). These results are comparable with the German (75%
and 5.4, respectively) and Scandinavian (75.6% and 6.1,
respectively) patients in the AWARE study. It is noteworthy that we used the UCT rather than the Urticaria Activity
Score (UAS) given that it is a retrospective and easy-to-use
patient-reported outcome; the UCT allows a more global
evaluation that takes into account angioedema status.

The quality of life scales (DLQI and AE-QoL for
angioedema) provided evidence of the negative impact of
inadequately treated chronic urticaria. The impaired quality
of life was nevertheless limited as shown by the mean total
score of DLQI (8.6) which was comparable to the scores
reported for German (8.3) and Scandinavian (7.7) patients.
However, a significant proportion of the lives of patients was
heavily disturbed by this insufficiently controlled disease
that had a median duration of three years from diagnosis; for

EJD, vol. 29, n° 1, January-February 2019

33.0% of patients, chronic urticaria had a “very large effect
on patient life” (score: 11-20) and for 2.3%, an “extremely
large effect on patient life” (score: 21-30). In addition, the
insufficient control of chronic urticaria was responsible for
frequent admissions to emergency departments (24.7% of
patients from the onset of symptoms; 3.6 admissions on
average) and visits to the general practitioner (80.8%; 8.1
consultations on average). These data confirm that patients
with chronic urticaria use a significant level of healthcare
resources, as recently demonstrated by the survey of Balp
et al. in five European countries [11, 12]. We note, however, that a majority of patients in our cohort did not benefit
from a visit to a dermatologist/allergologist or to a specialised urticaria centre, although the disease had a median
duration of three years.

The main limitations of this study are common to all noninterventional studies with patient-related outcomes and
retrospective data based on patient recall. Another limitation is the study sample size that made the subgroup
analysis for infrequent events, such as associated disorders, difficult. Despite these limitations, there is an overall
consistency between the main results and those from other
published AWARE studies and other studies with French
patients [29, 30].

In conclusion, the baseline data of the French cohort of the
AWARE study provides evidence that most patients suffering from H1-antihistamine-refractory chronic urticaria
for a median of three years are insufficiently treated and
dissatisfied with their treatment. Despite their impaired
quality of life and significant healthcare resource utilisation, access to specialised consultations for patients remains
low. The prospective data from the AWARE study will provide an initial analysis and allow for a comparison of the
different therapeutic options and their impact on symptoms
and quality of life at the end of the two-year follow-up
period. Ml
