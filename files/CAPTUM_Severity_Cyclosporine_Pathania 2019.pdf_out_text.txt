ARTICLEINFO ABSTRACT

Keywords: Background: Literature on the efficacy of azathioprine in antihistamine refractory chronic spontaneous urticaria
Refractory chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is limited.

Cyclosporine

Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of azathioprine with respect to cyclosporine in the treatment of
refractory CSU.

Methods: In this prospective, randomized, active-controlled, non-inferiority study, 80 patients of refractory CSU
were administered either cyclosporine (group A, n = 40) or azathioprine (group B, n = 40) for 90 days and
followed up for further 90 days. The treatment efficacy was assessed every 15th day using urticaria activity score
(UAS7) and outcome scoring scale (OSS). Serum IgE levels, autologous serum skin test (ASST) and autologous
plasma skin test (APST) were additionally measured at baseline and 90th day.

Results: Primary end point (>75% reduction in UAS7 at 90th day) was achieved by 31/40 (79.5%) patients in
group A and 32/40 (80%) patients in group B (proportion difference —0.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] of
difference -17.13 to 18.09; point estimates favoring B, CIs demonstrating non-inferiority). At 180th day, >75%
reduction in UAS7 was maintained in 19/40 (47.95%) patients in group A and 24/40 (60%) patients in group B
(proportion difference —12.5%, 95% CI of difference -9.00 to 32.46, point estimates favoring B, CIs demonstrating
non-inferiority). Thus, the number of patients who could maintain >75% reduction in UAS7 at 180th day reduced
significantly in group A (proportion difference 30%, 95% CI of difference 8.78 to 47.77), but not in group B
(proportion difference 20%, 95% CI of difference -0.10 to 38.10). The values of mean UAS7 significantly
decreased from 28.70 + 4.42 and 28.88 + 4.25 at baseline, to 5.56 + 5.12 and 7.0 + 4.48 at 90th day in group A
and B respectively (group A, mean difference —23.27, 95% CI of difference -25.33 to -21.22; group B, mean
difference —21.87, 95% CI of difference -23.78 to -19.96). It increased significantly to 9.98 + 5.46 in group A at
180th day (mean difference 4.55, 95% CI of difference 2.98 to 6.12), but not in group B (mean UAS7 180th day
7.88 + 5.53, mean difference 0.88, 95% CI of difference -0.82 to 2.57). The reduction in number of patients
having positive ASST post-treatment was significant in group A, whereas reduction in IgE levels was more significant in group B.

Conclusion: The present study concludes that azathioprine is not inferior to cyclosporine in the treatment of refractory CSU, and it can be a valuable adjunct, especially in resource poor settings.

Introduction

According to recent EAACI/GA7LEN/EDF/WAO, guideline (European
Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Global Allergy and
Asthma European Network, European Dermatology Forum, World Allergy Organization),'* second-generation H1 antihistamines (AH1) are
the first line treatment options for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU).
Non-response to AH1 is common’ and almost 10-50% of patients do not
respond adequately to even 4-fold increased doses of AH1 and end up
requiring repeated courses of oral corticosteroids to control disease
exacerbations.*° As per the EAACI/GA*LEN/EDF/WAO guideline, a
treatment option for such patients includes the addition of omalizumab,
the availability of which is limited due to high costs.” Cyclosporine is the
next line treatment option for these patients, but its use is restricted
owing to high costs (especially in resource poor settings) and associated
adverse effects.” Azathioprine was found to be beneficial in cyclosporine
resistant CSU in 2 patients’ (in a dosage of 150 mg/day) and also
responded fairly in autologous serum skin test (ASST) positive CSU in a
prior placebo-controlled study (in a dosage of 50 mg/day).° In the
absence of any previous study, we attempted to compare azathioprine
with cyclosporine (an established agent in the management of antihistamine refractory CSU) in this prospective, active-controlled, non-inferiority study.

Methods
Study design

This randomized, prospective, comparative study was conducted at the
urticaria clinic of a tertiary care center in North India, which is a Global
Allergy and Asthma European Network (GALEN) recognized center for
urticaria management. Sample size of 40 per arm (allocation ratio, r = 1)
was calculated using a non-inferiority trial design; using a power of 80% (B
= 0.2), type 1 error (alpha at two sided 95% confidence intervals) = 0.025,
and a non-inferiority margin (delta) of —0.2 (20% loss of effect).° The
non-inferiority margin was derived from the previous placebo-controlled
randomized controlled study of cyclosporine (with a confidence interval
of 6.6-18.8 for UAS7 reduction for cyclosporine [sandimmune preparation, 4 mg/kg], and —3.3-7.9 for placebo).'° All consecutive chronic
spontaneous urticaria (CSU) patients with active disease presenting from
June 2016 to July 2017 were screened (n = 610) to include 80 patients
who satisfied the following inclusion-exclusion criteria (excluded chronic
inducible urticaria [CINDU], n = 140; CSU not fulfilling other inclusion
criteria, n = 305; declined to participate, n = 85).

Inclusion criteria

1. Patients of CSU having active disease with duration >6 months
(arbitrarily chosen; in absence of any valid definition for refractory
urticaria) and

2. Refractory CSU arbitrarily defined for present study as failure to
respond to 4-fold increased doses of standard 2nd generation AH1
(levocetirizine) prescribed for at least 3 continuous months and
requiring repeated short-term courses of oral corticosteroids, at least
one such course per month.

Exclusion criteria

CINDU, urticarial vasculitis, acute urticaria and anaphylaxis,
angioedema without wheals, pregnancy and lactation, underlying hepatic and renal disease and malignancy.

All recruited patients signed an informed written consent. The institute ethics committee approved the study (NCT03250143, trial registration number CTRI/2017/08/009213, both documents are being
submitted in supplementary files). The overall study design is depicted in

Fig. 1. Flowchart depicting the basic study design.

As per the EAACI/GA*LEN/EDF/WAO guideline, we uniformly start
our patients having CU on recommended doses of AH1 (example, levocetirizine 5 mg), and sequentially increase the dose every week, until
adequate clinical response is achieved or maximum dose is reached (4
times recommended dose). When a patient presents with acute exacerbation while still taking the maximum doses of antihistamines, a short
course of oral prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/day for 5-7 days) is administered. A non-response to four-fold dosages of antihistamines is subsequently followed by the addition of phototherapy, cyclosporine,
methotrexate or omalizumab, based on the patient's clinical profile and
affordability. Since ours is a tertiary care center, we see quite a few
antihistamine refractory patients who have usually endured CSU for
more than 6 months, or even more, and are on maximal licensed dosages
of antihistamines at the time they present to us. After confirming their
current and previous treatments, such patients are directly managed by
the addition of various immunosuppressants to their antihistamine
regimen.

Previous treatments

Apart from AH1 and oral corticosteroids, patients had received
leukotriene receptor antagonists (n = 12) and methotrexate (n = 4).
During a washout period of 1 month before inclusion in the present
study, all treatments except AH1 (preferably levocetirizine) were
discontinued.

Randomization and treatment

Forty random, single and double-digit numbers from 1 to 80 were
extracted from computer-generated random number tables and assigned
to a particular treatment arm (MSK). Eighty opaque brown-paper
Y.S. Pathania et al.

envelopes, each containing a paper slip with a particular number and
corresponding treatment arm, were prepared to conceal the allocation
sequence from both patient and randomizing investigator. These envelopes were arranged in a stack randomly. Eligible and consenting patients
were randomized, in accordance with the particulars that the envelope
on their sequence contained. The process of recruitment was performed
by investigator DP. Patients in group A were administered cyclosporine
(microemulsion form), whereas those in group B received azathioprine.
Cyclosporine was started at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day, whereas azathioprine
was started at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (both administered in 2 divided
doses, e.g., azathioprine 25 mg twice a day, cyclosporine 100 mg and 50
mg in morning and evening, respectively). Also, all patients were uniformly started on oral levocetirizine 10 mg/day, which was maintained
throughout the treatment and follow-up period.

Baseline investigations

Comprehensive physical examination, complete hemogram, renal
and hepatic function tests, urine microscopic examination, chest X-ray,
serological tests for HIV, Hepatitis B and C, serum IgE levels, and thyroid
function tests including thyroid autoantibodies were carried out in all
patients prior to inclusion in the study. Serum IgE levels above 100 IU/ml
were considered as raised (as per standardized chemiluminescence immune assay). Autologous serum skin test (ASST) and autologous plasma
skin test (APST) were performed at baseline using standard guidelines,"
and they were considered positive if the average diameter of wheal
induced by serum and plasma, respectively, was greater than 1.5 mm in
comparison to the diameter of wheal induced by normal saline. All female patients were counseled regarding the need of employing 2
methods of contraception to avoid conception during treatment and 3
months thereafter and to disclose urgently if they developed amenorthoea. Regular urine pregnancy tests (UPTs) were not advised, though
one UPT was performed 15 days prior to starting treatment.

Assessment and follow-up

The total study period for each patient was 180 days, divided
equally between treatment and follow-up (90 days each). Urticaria
activity score (uas)!? and outcome scoring scale (oss)!* were used to
measure the frequency and severity of the disease and response to
treatment (Table 1). Complete hemogram, and renal and hepatic
function tests were performed every 2 weeks for the first month and
monthly thereafter. Monitoring of blood pressure was regularly performed with cyclosporine.

UAS7 is the standard urticaria disease activity measuring score.'*
Patients were instructed to write down the number of wheals and
severity of itching they experienced in their daily urticaria diary on a

daily basis. At every 15th day, UAS7 (derived by adding itch and wheal
score as written in the patient's diary for last week, range 0-42), and OSS
(range 1-5) were calculated. At the completion of treatment (90th day),
serum IgE levels, ASST and APST were repeated. Subsequently, patients
were followed up every 15th day for 90 more days (using UAS7 and OSS
at every follow-up). The follow-up of all patients was completed by
January 2018. Since the standard chronic urticaria related quality of life
score (CU-QoL) has not been validated in either Hindi or Punjabi (the
national language and vernacular language of our region, respectively),
for the purpose of present study patients were asked at the end of study
period to subjectively grade cyclosporine and azathioprine as a treatment
option for their CRU on scale of 0-10, with 0 being the worst and 10
being the best (defined as the patient satisfaction score).

Study end-points

Primary end-point
Number of patients achieving >75% reduction in their UAS7 at 90th
day (end of treatment) compared to baseline.

Secondary end-points

1. Change in mean UAS7and OSS from baseline to 90th (end of treatment)and 180th day (end of follow-up) within group A and B.

2. Percentage of patients showing improvement on basis of OSS scoring.

3. Change in ASST, APST and IgE levels from baseline to 90th day within
group A and B.

4. Comparison for the above mentioned parameters between group A
and B.

5. Patient global assessment using patient satisfaction score at 180th day
for group A and B.

Relapse
Relapse was defined as return of UAS7 to the baseline value.

Statistical analysis

The statistical analysis was carried out using Statistical Package for
Social Sciences (SPSS for Windows). Normality of the quantitative data
was assessed using Kolmogorov Smirnov test and their descriptive data
was presented by Mean + SD or median/interquartile (IQR) range,
depending upon the distribution of the data (normal/skewed). Two-sided
95% confidence intervals were determined for all parameters, and all
statistics were performed at a significance level of p = 0.025.

Secondary end points

Change in UAS7 (Table 3)

Within group analysis. The values of mean UAS7 significantly
decreased from 28.70 + 4.42 and 28.88 + 4.25 at baseline, to 5.56 +
5.12 and 7.0 + 4.48 at 90th day in group A and B respectively (group A,
mean difference —23.27, 95% CI of difference -25.33 to -21.22; group B,
mean difference —21.87, 95% CI of difference -23.78 to -19.96). It
increased significantly to 9.98 + 5.46 in group A at 180th day (mean
difference 4.55, 95% CI of difference 2.98 to 6.12), but not in group B
(mean UAS7 180th day 7.88 + 5.53, mean difference 0.88, 95% CI of
difference -0.82 to 2.57). Within group A this increase was statistically
significant at all the follow-up visits; whereas in group B this increase was
not statistically significant at any of the follow-up visits (Fig. 2a).

Comparison between groups. The mean UAS7 was not significantly
different in groups A and B at 90th day (mean difference —1.57, 95% CI
of difference -3.72 to 0.57; point estimate favoring A, CIs demonstrating
non-inferiority) and 180th day (mean difference 2.10, 95% CI of difference -0.35 to 4.55; point estimate favoring B, CIs demonstrating noninferiority). At 180th day, >75% reduction in UAS7 was maintained in
19/40 (47.95%) patients in group A and 24/40 (60%) patients in group B
(proportion difference —12.5%, 95% CI of difference -9.00 to 32.46,
point estimate favoring B, CIs demonstrating non-inferiority). The
number of patients who could maintain >75% reduction in UAS7 at
180th day reduced significantly in group A (proportion difference 30%,
95% CI of difference 8.78 to 47.77) but not in group B (proportion difference 20%, 95% CI of difference -0.10 to 38.10).

Change in OSS (Table 3)
Within group analysis. The mean OSS significantly increased from
2.85 + 1.04 and 2.70 + 0.91 at 15th day to 4.23 + 0.70 and 4.05 + 0.59

World Allergy Organization Journal 12 (2019) 100033

at 90th day (mean difference 1.40, 95% CI of difference 1.06 to 1.74 in
group A; mean difference 1.35, 95% CI of difference 1.06 to 1.65 in group
B); and decreased to 3.59 + 0.78 and 3.87 + 0.79 at 180th day in group A
and B respectively (group A, mean difference —0.68, 95% CI of difference
-0.89 to -0.45; group B, mean difference —0.18, 95% CI of difference
-0.41 to 0.06, Fig. 2b).

Comparison between groups. The values of OSS between the groups did
not differ significantly when compared at 90th day ([group A, IQR 4-5,
median 4], [group B, IQR 4-4.0, median 4], Mann Whitney test; median
difference 0.00, 95% CI of difference 0.00 to 0.00) and 180th day ([group
A, IQR 3-4, median 4], [group B, IQR 3-4.0, median 4], Mann Whitney
test, median difference 0.00, 95% CI of difference -1.00 to 0.00). Number
of patients achieving clearance, marked improvement, moderate
improvement, minimal improvement and no improvement, as graded
through OSS, are presented in Table 3.

Effect on ASST and APST

The number of ASST positive patients in group A decreased significantly from 16/40 (40%) at baseline to 2/40 (5%) at 90th day (Mc Nemar
test, proportion difference 5%, 95% CI of difference 17.15 to 50.82); and
that in group B decreased from 12/40 (30%) to 6/40 (15%) at 90th day
(proportion difference 15%, 95% CI of difference -3.45 to 32.35). In both
group A and B, 2 patients had positive APST at baseline, and both turned
negative at the end of treatment (proportion difference 5%, 95% CI of
difference -4.48 to 16.50, Table 3).

Effect on serum IgE levels

In group A, the median levels of serum IgE decreased significantly
from 91.35 IU/ml (<100 IU/ml; IQR 50.27-248.75 IU/ml) at baseline to
72.5 U/ml (IQR 40.5-147.5) at the 90th day (median difference —27.65,
95% CI of difference -64.35 to -10.10, Hodges-Lehman median difference). In group B, the median levels of serum IgE decreased significantly
from 243.0 IU/ml (IQR 78.27-654.0 IU/ml) at baseline to 164.15 IU/ml
(IQR 60.0-515.0 IU/ml) at the 90th day (median difference —88.57, 95%
Cl of difference -209.50 to -28.70, Hodges-Lehman median difference).
The reduction in serum IgE levels was more significant in group B than A,
but the values at baseline were also significantly higher in group B than
A, Table 3.

Relapse
Relapse was noted in one patient in group A.
Mean patient satisfaction score

It was comparable at 180th day, being 7.5 in group A and 7.2 in group
B (p 0.979, mean difference 0.30).

Adverse effects

Nausea and heartburn were experienced by 3 patients on initiating
cyclosporine and responded adequately to rabeprazole. Abdominal pain
and mild vomiting were experienced by 2 patients on initiating azathioprine, but responded to antiemetics. No hepatic, renal or hematological
adverse effects were observed. All patients completed the study and there
were no dropouts.

Discussion

CSU can have a dreadful effect on quality of life, especially when
antihistamine resistant.'‘ Cyclosporine has been previously evaluated in
the treatment of resistant urticaria in very low (<2 mg/kg/day), low
(2-4 mg/kg/day) and moderate (4-5 mg/kg/day) dosages.'°!°17 A
recent meta-analysis suggested 3 mg/kg/day as a reasonable starting

dosage of cyclosporine in resistant urticaria, a dose that was employed in
the present study.'® Moreover, cyclosporine has proved quite safe in
CRU,!°”° with no adverse effects being noticed even after 5-10 years of
therapy at low doses.”! There are only 2 prior publications stating the
efficacy of azathioprine in CU. A placebo-controlled study by Bhanja
et al.,° found low-dose azathioprine (50 mg/day) to be effective in a
cohort of ASST positive CSU patients and the remission lasted till 36
weeks. Azathioprine was also employed successfully in 2 patients having
resistant urticaria who had failed high-dose cyclosporine.”

In the present study, we compared low-dose cyclosporine with low
dose azathioprine using a non-inferiority design, and the primary end
point (>75% reduction in UAS7 at the end of treatment) was achieved by
77.5% patients in group A and 80% patients in group B (comparable to
66-73% response to low-moderate dosages of cyclosporine at 12 weeks,
as suggested previously'*). Clinically meaningful minimum important
difference (MID) for UAS7 has been previously defined between
9.5-10.5.”” In the present study, the reduction observed in UAS7 at 90th
day when compared to baseline was 23.3 and 22.3 in cyclosporine and
azathioprine groups, respectively (Tables 2 and 3), and it was comparable to that obtained with omalizumab in prior studies.” Patients in
both groups were able to achieve a significant reduction in their mean
UAS7 at 90th day (end of treatment), after which UAS7 started rising

gradually in both groups indicating increase in disease activity. The rise
was significantly more in group A, and it became significant as soon as 30
days after stopping cyclosporine. A similar trend was observed with OSS,
and it rose significantly in both the groups with treatment, only to reduce
again in post treatment. The reduction was statistically significant in
group A, and was seen as early as 30 days after discontinuation of
cyclosporine. Although the patients achieving azathioprine also experienced mild increase in the disease activity after discontinuation of
treatment, it was not significant. Overall, >75% reduction in UAS7 was
maintained in 19 and 24 patients in groups A and B, respectively, during
follow-up (as compared to 31 and 32 at 90th day respectively). Therefore, in the cyclosporine group, a statistically significant reduction was
observed in the number of patients who could maintain >75% reduction
in UAS7 at 180th day. Regarding the primary end-point, the point estimate favored azathioprine, whereas CIs demonstrated non-inferiority.
Regarding the secondary end-point, point estimate of the difference in
the mean “UAS7 reduction” favored cyclosporine at 90th day and
azathioprine at 180th day; whereas the CIs demonstrated non-inferiority.

Relapse was noticed in 1 patient, who had achieved good initial
control with cyclosporine. Azathioprine is known to cause myelosuppression and hepatitis, whereas cyclosporine can cause nephrotoxicity
and hypertension. In the present study, adequate monitoring was
Y.S. Pathania et al.

routinely performed, and both agents were found to be safe, and serious
adverse effects warranting the discontinuation of treatment were not
noticed. This can be attributed to low doses of cyclosporine and azathioprine employed (comparable to prior study on azathioprine®). Both
agents rendered antihistamine-resistant disease adequately responsive to
antihistamines for the intended study duration and scored comparably on
global patient satisfaction score at the end of the study.

Positive ASST and raised serum IgE levels are traditionally considered
a marker of chronic and severe disease. The reduction in the number of
patients having a positive ASST was significantly greater with cyclosporine, as seen in a prior study.'° Both azathioprine” and cyclosporine
have been found to reduce the levels of serum IgE levels in atopic
dermatitis”* and CU’° respectively, though the results with cyclosporine
in atopic dermatitis are conflicting.”° The exact mechanism for this is not
known; though cyclosporine has also been shown to reduce the levels of
IL-5 post-treatment in CSU.'” We observed that the reduction in IgE
levels was more significant in patients receiving azathioprine, but the
same cannot be overemphasized because the baseline serum IgE levels
were significantly higher in azathioprine arm and values were lesser than
100 IU/ml in the cyclosporine arm. Moreover, repeated measurements of
serum IgE levels are not recommended by current guidelines and should
not be used as a surrogate marker to assess the degree of response to
treatment.

Limitations

1. Thiopurine methyl transferase levels could not be carried out because
of affordability issues.

2. Longer follow-up duration could have better ascertained the efficacy
and relapse rate.

3. One of the perceived limitations of the current study is the lack of a
placebo group. However, withholding a potentially effective treatment in patients having severe refractory chronic spontaneous urticaria could not be ethically justified. Although lack of placebo arm
does not allow us to definitely exclude the possibility of spontaneous
remission (regression to the mean, as the patients are simply cured with
time’), the strict inclusion criteria and the severity and duration of
disease in our cohort (mean disease duration > 5 years, mean
continuous treatment duration > 2 years, and baseline UAS7 >28)
exceeded the time window normally associated with spontaneous
remission.

4. We have not objectively measured angioedema severity score and CUQoL questionnaire in our patients.

Conclusion

The present study concludes that low-dose azathioprine is not inferior
to low-dose cyclosporine in the treatment of antihistamine refractory
CSU, and it can be a valuable adjunct in the treatment of patients who are
intolerant to cyclosporine or have affordability issues, especially in
resource poor settings.
