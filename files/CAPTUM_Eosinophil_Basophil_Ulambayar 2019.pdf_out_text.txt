ABSTRACT

Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is also known as histamine releasing factor
as it has the ability to activate mast cells. To investigate the role of [CTP in the pathogenesis
of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), we evaluated serum level of TCTP and effect

of TCTP on basophil and mast cell degranulation. TCTP levels in the sera from 116 CSU
patients and 70 normal healthy controls (NCs) were measured by ELISA. CD203c expression
on basophils from CSU patients and B-hexosaminidase release from Laboratory of Allergic
Disease 2 mast cells were measured upon stimulation monomeric and dimeric TCTP. Nonreducing Western blot analysis was used for detecting dimeric TCTP. No difference was
observed in serum TCTP levels between CSU patients and NCs (p=0.676). However, dimeric
TCTP intensity on Western blot was stronger in CSU patients than in NCs. TCTP levels were
higher in patients with severe CSU (p=0.049) and with IgG positivity to FceRIa (p=0.038).

A significant positive correlation was observed between TCTP and eosinophil cationic
protein levels (Spearman's rho=0.341; p=0.001). Both basophil and mast cell degranulation
were significantly increased after stimulation with dimeric TCTP, but not with monomic
TCTP. The ability of TCTP to activate basophil and mast cells is dependent on dimerization,
suggesting that the inhibition of [CTP dimerization can be a therapeutic option for CSU.
Association between TCTP levels and the presence of IgG to high affinity Fc epsilon receptor
Ialpha subunit in CSU patients indicates that autoimmune mechanisms may be involved in
the dimerization of TCTP.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is characterized by wheals and/or angioedema lasting
for more than 6 wk, with no definite extrinsic cause (1). The prevalence of chronic urticaria
(CU) has been found to range between 0.3%-11.3%, and the rate of hospitalization due to

urticaria appears to be increasing (2). Accord:

ing to a 5-year nationwide epidemiological study

in Korea, the overall ratio of CU among all urticaria patients was, on average, 23.5% (3).

Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP), also known as p23, fortilin, and histamine

releasing factor, is a multifunctional protein widely expressed in almost all eukaryotic

organisms (4). Previous reports have shown that intracellular TCTP expression is dependent

on calcium concentrations and microtubule binding protein (5,6). In allergic disease,

extracellular TCTP, which is observed in nasal

and bronchoalveolar lavage and skin blister

fluids, exhibits the capacity to induce histamine release from basophils (7). Indeed,
recombinant TCTP has been found to enhance IL-4, IL-13, and histamine release from IgE
sensitized human basophils (8,9). Also, other immune cells involved in allergic disease,

such as eosinophils, B cells, bronchial epithe

ial cells, and T cells, appear to be at least

partly regulated by TCTP (10-13). While some studies have suggested that the role of TCTP
in basophil activation is dependent on IgE (14), Wantke et al. (15) demonstrated that TCTP

exerts a stimulating effect via its specific rece
it does not bind with IgE (9,14). Notwithstan

ptor on the surface of human basophils and that

 

ing, a recent study reported that both serum

TCTP levels and specific IgE Ab against TCTP were increased in CSU patients (16).

The activating mechanism of TCTP has not been fully elucidated in CSU. Kim et al. (13),
however, demonstrated that dimerization of TCTP is essential for its cytokine-like activity

in OVA-induced airway inflammed mice and atopic dermatitis-like NC/Nga mice in vivo (17).

In the present study, we sought to compare TCTP levels in CSU patients and normal healthy

controls (NCs) and to investigate whether monomeric and dimeric TCTP have different

effects on basophil and mast cell activation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Clinical characteristics of the study subjects
We enrolled 70 NCs and 116 CSU patients who had urticaria symptoms for at least 6 wk
(Table 1). Disease activity of CSU was assessed using urticaria activity score (UAS), which

evaluates wheal characteristics, pruritus status, and symptom duration. Total scores ranged

from 0-15, with higher scores indicating higher disease activity (18). The patients with UAS

213 has been classified into severe CSU (19). For assessing basophil activation, peripheral

blood was collected from 24 CSU patients for whom antihistamine medication was

withdrawn for at least 5 days before collecting their blood samples. The study was approved
by the Institutional Review Board at the Ajou University Medical Center (AJIRB-BMRMDB-17-221, AJIRB-GEN-SMP-13-108). Each patient provided written informed consent.

Autologous serum skin test (ASST), atopy, total IgE, and other
autoantibodies measurements

ASST was performed and interpreted according to appropriate guidelines (20). Atopy was
defined as a positive result to at least one allergen on skin prick tests with common inhalant
allergens (tree mixture, grass mixture, mugwort, ragweed, cat fur, dog fur, Dermatophagoides
pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, and Alternaria spp.) (Bencard, Bretford, UK). Total IgE
and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) levels were measured by the ImmunoCAP system
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Anti-thyroid autoantibodies (ATAs), including anti-thyroglobulin and thyroid microsomal
antibodies, were detected by radioimmunoassay (BRAHMS Aktiengesellschaft, Hennigsdorf,
Germany). To measure IgG to high affinity Fc epsilon receptor I alpha subunit (FceRIq) in
sera from CSU patients and NCs, we performed rapid dot-blot immunoassay as described
previously (21).

Measurement of TCTP in serum

Serum TCTP concentrations were determined by ELISA (MyBioSource Ltd, San Diego,
CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Both intra-assay and inter-assay
coefficients of variation (%) were less than 15%, and the sensitivity of the kit was 1 ng/ml.

Purification of recombinant TCTP protein

Recombinant monomeric and dimeric TCTP used for stimulation was purified in an
Escherichia coli system, as described previously (13). Briefly, pRSET A/TCTP or Del-N11 TCTP
was transformed to E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS, and the cells were grown in Luria-Bertani
medium containing 100 g/ml of ampicillin and 34 pg/ml of chloramphenicol. The preculture medium was diluted and cultured until reaching an ODgo0 of 0.6-0.8. IPTG was
added to induce recombinant protein, and then, the cell pellets were stored at -70°C or used
directly. Cell pellets were disrupted by sonication, and supernatants containing soluble
proteins were purified with HisPur™ Cobalt Resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, eluted proteins were loaded onto a HiTrap
QHP column (GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ, USA), which was equilibrated with buffer A
(20 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl; pH 7.4). Proteins were separated by AKTA FPLC
systems (GE Healthcare) and eluted with buffer B (20 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl; pH
7.4) at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min. The eluted fractions were screened by SDS-PAGE
and Coomassie blue staining. The purity of the proteins was 85%-98% and no other bands
were observed visually except target protein (Supplementary Fig. 1). Samples containing
monomeric or dimeric TCTP were collected, desalted with PBS, concentrated using Vivaspin
500 (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany), and stored at ~70°C until ready for use. To reduce
lipopolysaccharide contamination, final proteins were additionally purified with EndoTrap
(Cambrex, Walkersvile, MD, USA).

Western blotting for detecting dimerized TCTP in sera from CSU patients and
NCs

Serum was diluted 2X Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. After centrifugation,

the supernatants were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE in non-reducing condition and

electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). Membranes
were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% BSA/TBS-T. The primary Ab against TCTP
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) was diluted 1:1,000 with blocking buffer and
incubated overnight at 4°C with the membrane. After washing three times with TBS-T, the
membranes were incubated with a goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugated secondary Ab (BioRad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were
washed again, visualized with ECL plus reagent (SurModics Inc., Eden Prairie, MN, USA), and
detected by a LAS-3000 CCD camera (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan).

Basophil activation test
CD203c expression on the surface of basophils was measured by flow cytometry (22). Whole

 

blood was collected in acid citrate dextrose tubes, and red blood cells were lysed with red
blood cell lysis buffer (0.154 M NH,Cl, 10 mM KHCO,, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2~7.4). After
washing with PBS, resuspended cells were stimulated by recombinant TCTP protein at
different concentrations (4 to 32.5 ug/ml) for 2 h at 37°C. After incubation, the cells were
washed with PBS and stained by phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human CD203c (Beckman
Coulter, Marseille, France), FITC-conjugated anti-human CD123 (BD PharMingen, San
Jose, CA, USA), and allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-human human leukocyte antigen
(HLA)-DR (BD PharMingen) or isotype-matched controls on ice in the dark for 30 min. After
washing once with PBS, the cells were analyzed on a FACS Canto II flow cytometer (Becton
Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA). Basophils were identified as CD123* HLA-DR populations.
The percentage of cells expressing CD203c was evaluated by comparing TCTP stimulated
basophils with non-stimulated (resting) basophils.

Measurement of B-hexosaminidase release from Laboratory of Allergic
Disease 2 (LAD-2) cells

LAD-2 mast cells were kindly provided by Dr. Arnold Kirshenbaum (National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD, USA). The release of B-hexosaminidase from
LAD-2 cells was measured as previously described (23). Cells were treated by monomeric and
dimeric TCTP (50 to 200 ug/ml) with or without simultaneous biotinylated-IgE (100 ng/ml;
BioPorto Diagnostics, Hellerup, Denmark) overnight sensitization, followed by 30 min of
stimulation with streptavidin peroxidase (100 ng/ml) or calcium ionophore A23187 (1 1M) in
HEPES buffer containing 0.4% BSA at 37°C. Total B-hexosaminidase was obtained by lysing
LAD-2 cells in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The supernatants were collected and incubated
with an equal volume of p-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-B-D-glucosamide in citrate buffer (pH 4.5,
40 mM citric acid/20 mM Na,HPO,'7H,0) for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by adding
0.4 M glycine buffer, and signals were read at 405 nM. The percentage of degranulation was
calculated as 100*(OD stimutatea~ OD non-stimulated) (OD total sates

 

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 20 for Windows (SPSS Inc.,

 

Chicago, IL, USA). Data are presented as a meantstandard deviation or as a median
(interquartile range) value when variables were not normally distributed. A multiple
regression model was applied to determine the variables most predictive of circulating TCTP
concentrations as logarithm (log)-transformed values among those known to be associated
with TCTP, including age, gender, atopy status, IgG to FceRIa positivity, disease severity, and
serum ECP level. Pearson correlation analysis identified associations among the continuous
parameters. The p-values <0.05 were considered indicative of statistical significance.

RESULTS

Serum TCTP levels in CSU patients and NCs

Median levels of serum TCTP in CSU patients (34.4 [2.93-242.9] ng/ml) were not different
from those in NCs (37.5 [1.19-195.7] ng/ml, Fig. 1A). We attempted to differentiate dimeric
from monomeric TCTP in the sera from CSU patients and NCs using non-reducing Western
blot analysis. In doings so, we identified separate bands of higher and lower molecular
weights. The bands located in a position of higher molecular weight were regarded as
dimerized or oligomerized TCTP (Supplementary Fig. 2), which are conformationally
modified. Relatively higher signal intensity for dimeric bands was noted for the sera from 4
patients with CSU, while the sera from NCs showed higher signal intensity for monomeric
TCTP bands (Fig. 1B). However, we could not quantitatively analyze dimeric and monomeric
TCTP amounts (Supplementary Fig. 3).

Correlation of serum TCTP levels with clinical characteristics of CSU

The median level of serum TCTP was higher in atopic CSU patients than in non-atopic patients
(40.5 [25.5-65.0] ng/ml vs. 29.0 [12.0-61.0] ng/ml, respectively, p=0.019, Fig. 2A). However,
no difference in TCTP levels was observed regarding to ASST positivity (38.8 [22.1-65.0] ng/ml
vs. 30.4 [19.1-56.3] ng/ml, respectively, p=0.429). Patients with positive IgG to FceRIa
autoantibody had significantly higher serum TCTP levels than patients with negative IgG to
FceRIo autoantibody (50.1 [25.4-73.7] ng/ml vs. 31.4 [19.5-64.1] ng/ml, respectively, p=0.03,
Fig. 2B). Serum TCTP levels did not differ according to the presence ofATA, anti-nuclear Ab,
or angioedema among CSU patients. Regarding therapeutic responses to antihistamine,
serum TCTP levels tended to be higher in refractory CSU patients than in patients responsive
to antihistamines, although statistical significance was lacking (40.5 [22.2-77.1] ng/ml vs.
31.0 [19.4-56.0] ng/ml, p=0.141). However, a significant difference in serum TCTP levels

was noted between severe and non-severe CSU patients (41.1 [28.0-70.4] ng/ml vs. 30.2
[19.4-54.3] ng/ml, p=0.049, Fig. 2c). Log-transformed serum TCTP levels were negatively
correlated with age (r=-0.244; p=0.008), whereas they had a positive correlation with logtransformed ECP in CSU patients (r=0.346; p=0.002). No significant correlation was found
between TCTP and total IgE levels in CSU patients (data not shown).

With the results of univariate analyses, we performed multiple regression analysis to identify
predictors of serum TCTP levels in patients with CSU. Significant positive correlations

DISCUSSION

The present study demonstrated that dimeric TCTP can induce basophil activation and
mast cell degranulation, while monomeric TCTP has no influence on basophils/mast cells.
Even though the median levels of TCTP were not different between CSU patients and NCs,
more intense bands of higher molecular weight reflective of the dimerized form of TCTP on
Western blotting were noted in CSU patients than in NCs.

TCTP is ubiquitously expressed in all eukaryotic organisms and tissues; however, expression
levels thereof vary among cell or tissue types. TCTP has been reported to be involved in

the pathogenic mechanisms of asthma, immune responses to parasitic infections, atopic
dermatitis, and CU (14,16,17,24). Kim et al. (13) revealed that TCTP conformationally changes
via intermolecular disulphide bonding into its dimerized form in order to confer its cytokineike activity. Thus, while TCTP might be present in normal conditions, sturctural modification
may occur in an allergic enviroment rich in oxidants or endogenous and exogenous proteases
that can induce dimerization of TCTP (13). Interestingly, mast cells release proteases, including

 

tryptase and chymase, during degranulation, and studies have shown that serum tryptase

levels are elevated in CU and associated with symptom occurrence and increased corticosteroid
requirement (25,26). In addition, an imbalance in reactive oxygen species and antioxidants has
been found to worsen allergic inflammation including CSU (27,28). We observed higher TCTP
levels in CSU patients with IgG autoantibody against FceRIa in the present study. Accordingly,
we presummed that the autoimmunity represented by the positivity of IgG to FceRIa could
affect the dimerizing process of TCTP. Nevertheless, because the receptor for dimeric TCTP on
basophils and mast cells has not been identified, the exact pathway of action for TCTP in the
activation of basophils and mast cells remains to be elucidated. The crystal structure of human
TCTP comprises a disulphide-linked dimer that confers an IgE binding site for degranulating
mast cells (29). A recent study also detected higher levels of serum specific IgE Ab against TCTP
in CSU patients (16), which supports our hypothesis that activation of TCTP may be associated
with the autoimmune mechanism of CSU pathogenesis. TCTP has been found to play a role in
immediate hypersensitivity by interacting with the Fab region of immunoglobulin and in mast

 

cell activation in an Fe receptor-dependent manner (24). Moreover, prior studies demonstrated
that different signal transduction events are initiated by TCTP on basophils in TCTP responders

and non-responders (10). Therein, TCTP was found to prime basophils through FceRIa or
another adapter molecule that is distinct from IL-3 in TCTP non-responders, whereas TCTP
induced secretion directly in TCTP responders (10). Based on our findings that dimeric, but
not monomeric, TCTP could induce degranulation of peripheral basophils from CSU patients,
we suspect that the dimerizing process might occur less in TCTP non-responders than in TCTP
responders inducing greater degranulation, despite similar total TCTP levels.

Kashiwakura et al. (24) reported that active TCTP interacts with immunoglobilins by its NH2terminal 19-residue peptide and H3 region with Fab region and crosslinking IgE to induce
degranulation of mast cell via FeeRIa receptor. However, we found no significant difference

in mase cell degranulation upon dimeric TCTP stimulation with or without IgE sensitization

in the present study. To eliminate the controversy regarding whether TCTP dependently

or independently activates mast cells via IgE (15), the exact activating pathway needs to be
elucidated. A recent study demonstrated that dimeric TCTP induces IL-8 production in bronchial
epithelial cells via the activation of adaptor protein 1 by phosphorylating MAPKs and the NF-kB
pathway, which are also involved in mast cell activation, in a linker of activation of T cell (LAT)dependent manner, thereby generating proinflammatory cytokines (30,31). Meanwhile, FceRIa.
aggregation has been found to lead to LAT phosphorylation through the phosphorylation of Syk,
Akt, MEK, and ERK upon exposure to TCTP in TCTP-responders (10,31). Consistent with these
results, we speculate that dimeric TCTP may induce basophils/mast cells degranulation via the
same signaling pathway. However, the lack of quantification of dimeric and monomeric TCTP
levels in the present study is the major limitation to overcome. We just suggested the possible
difference in the distribution of monomeric and dimeric TCTP from CSU patients to NCs visually
and it is supported by results of ex vivo and in vitro experiments.

The release of proteases, leukotrienes, lipid mediators, and histamine from mast cells
contributes not only to tissue inflammation but also to recruitment of eosinophils (32). Mast
cells are also sources of IL-5, TNFa, and eotaxin, all of which elicit eosinophil recruitment
and stimulation in urticarial lesions (32,33). ECP, a typical marker of eosinophil activation,

is known to be an indicator of disease severity in CU patients (34). Indeed, in the present
study, we suggest that urticaria severity and serum ECP levels might be significant predictors
of TCTP in patients with CSU. ECP has been shown to be concurrently expressed with VEGF
in the lesional skin of CSU patients, and increases in VEGF have been observed in the plasma
of CSU patients in association with urticaria severity (35). Accordingly, we presume that
there may be a direct link between TCTP dimerization and ECP or basophil/mast cell-induced
eosinophil activation that leads to more severe urticaria.

In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that dimerization of TCTP is important for
activation of basophils and mast cells in CSU. Atopic status and the presence of autoantibody
against FceRIa were found to be associated with enhanced dimerization of TCTP. In light of these
results, we deemed that dimeric TCTP induces basophil activation and mast cell degranulation
leading to eosinophil activation and increased urticaria severity in CSU. Accordingly, inhibition of
TCTP dimerization may be a potential therapeutic option for CSU patients.
