Purpose: Chronic urticaria (CU) has a substantial impact on the quality of life. Little clinical data on the prognosis of CU has been reported. This
study aimed to investigate the control status and remission rate of CU and to explore potential predictors of good responses to the treatment during
a 6-month treatment period. Methods: A total of 75 patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) were enrolled from 3 university hospitals in
Korea. Urticaria control state was classified into 2 groups: group | (remission and well-controlled) and group II (partly and uncontrolled). CU-specific
quality of life (CU-OoL) and the urticaria activity score (UAS) were measured before and after the treatment. Autologous serum skin test (ASST), and
anti-nuclear and anti-thyroid antibodies were measured at the enrollment into the study. Aspirin intolerance was confirmed by an oral provocation
test. Results: Of 59 patients completing the study, 21 (35.6%) arrived at well-controlled status and only 2 (3.4%) achieved remission, whereas 26
(44.1%) remained at partly controlled status and 10 (16.9%) were at uncontrolled status. Mean changes in CU-Qol (36.5+2.7 vs 20.6+4.3,

P=0.017) and UAS (-7.9+0.8 vs -3.0+1.0, P=0.001) were significantly different be

een groups | and Il. The presence of serum autoantibodies

 

and aspirin intolerance had no influence on the control of urticaria in this study. However, ASST positivity was identified as a significant predictor of
CU control in multivariate analysis (QR=6.106, P=0.017). Conclusions: The proportion of CSU patients that achieved remission or a well-controlled state was 39% for the 6 months of stepwise treatment. Longer observations are necessary to assess the exact prognosis of CSU. ASST results may be a useful parameter for predicting a better response to treatment and both UAS and CU-Ool are helpful to monitor therapeutic re

INTRODUCTION

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common skin disorder defined by
recurrent wheals and itching for at least 6 weeks. Previous studies have revealed a point prevalence of 0.1%-1.0% in the general population.'* CU has major detrimental effects on the quality
of life, with frequent sleep deprivation and psychiatric comorbidity.’ It also has a large impact on society in terms of direct
and indirect health care costs, as well as reduced performance
at work and in personal life.*

Regarding the pharmacological treatment of CU, recent
guidelines recommended a stepwise approach;** however, previous results on the prognosis of CU are variable. CU has generally been recognized as a non-life-threatening and transiently
symptomatic disease, with an average duration of 2 to 5 years.°

Although few studies have evaluated the duration of CU, in 70%
of patients, it persists for 1 year.”*In fact, more than 11% of CU
patients have urticaria symptoms for more than 5 years.’ However, it is likely to occur longer in more severe cases.’ Factors
predicting therapeutic response and disease severity are limited. Genetic factors related to mast cell activation and the overproduction of histamine and leukotriene have been suggested
to contribute to disease development and clinical heterogene

ity.'° Angioedema, severe CU, and anti-thyroid antibodies have
recently been identified as being associated with longer disease
duration." In addition, since the correlation between a positive autologous serum skin test (ASST) and the presence of
anti-FceRIa and anti-IgE antibodies was reported,” investigators have attempted to demonstrate the utility of ASST as a biomarker for identifying a distinct subgroup of CU patients or for
predicting treatment responses. However, to date, the association between ASST positivity and clinical course of CU has been
inconclusive.”"* This study was designed to evaluate the prognosis of a 6-month stepwise treatment and to determine predictors for control status in patients with CU.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Subjects

We performed a prospective observational study on 75 CSU
patients (24 males and 51 females, age 19-69 years, mean age
40.5 years) who were followed in the outpatient Allergy Clinic of
3 university hospitals, including Ajou University Hospital, Severance Hospital, and Wonju Severance Christian Hospital in
South Korea from November 2011 to March 2013. Inclusion criteria were patients aged = 19 years and having almost daily urticaria symptoms, such as wheals and itching, for at least 6 weeks.
Patients with other chronic skin diseases and those with clinical
evidence of urticarial vasculitis or inducible (physical stimuli or
cholinergic or exercise) urticaria were excluded. Each patient
submitted a written informed consent form at the time of enrollment, and the Institutional Review Board approved the study. A
stepwise treatment according to the recent guidelines’ was applied to all subjects. Our study protocol, including how to assess
urticaria control and to apply stepwise treatment, was reviewed
and accepted by all investigators before starting this study. Investigators determined the first treatment step for each subject
based on their medication history and current urticaria severity.
Step I and II treatments correspond to up to 2 and 4 tablets of
non-sedating antihistamines, respectively. The addition of leukotriene receptor antagonist to 4 antihistamine tablets was the
step III treatment. Immunosuppressive agents, including cyclosporine and oral corticosteroids, were regarded as the step IV
treatment.

Assessment of urticaria activity scores and urticaria control

CU disease activity was assessed using the urticaria activity
score (UAS), which scores wheals according to quantity, distribution range, mean diameter, and duration, in conjunction
with pruritus according to the intensity within the last week for
outpatient clinic visits, yielding a total score of 0-15."

Urticaria control state was classified into 4 categories according to our previous report: remission, well-controlled, partly
controlled, and uncontrolled.'® Remission was defined as the
absence of urticaria symptoms for at least 4 weeks without any

116 http://e-aair.org

Volume 8, Number 2, March 2016

medication. Patients who had no wheals or itching when taking
medication, but whose symptoms returned when they discontinued their medication, were deemed to have well-controlled
CU. Patients whose urticaria symptoms were reduced from the
previous visit, but not completely controlled, were classified as
partly controlled CU. Patients whose disease could not be controlled by medication were deemed to have uncontrolled CU.

The EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF/WAO guideline for the management of urticaria recommends re-evaluation of the necessity
for continued or alternative treatment every 3-6 months because of fluctuating disease activity of CU." Therefore, we assessed urticaria control state and UAS at the initial visit and in
the first, third, and sixth months after treatment, in total 4 times
during the study period. However, patients were able to see investigators, whenever they wanted to discuss changes in their
urticaria symptoms.

Autologous serum skin test

Antihistamines were withdrawn at least 5 days before blood
sampling. An intradermal autologous serum skin test (ASST)
was performed according to the method described in the EAACI/GA’LEN task force consensus report.’’ A positive result was
defined as a serum-induced wheal after 30 minutes with a diameter of at least 1.5 mm greater than that induced by saline.

Aspirin intolerance

Patients with aspirin intolerant chronic urticaria (AICU) was defined as those who had a definite history of urticaria/angioedema
development after the ingestion of aspirin and/or non-steroidal
antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and those who showed positive respones to the oral aspirin challenge test, as previously described.'* The appearance of urticaria within 4 hours without any
change in FEV1 was considered a positive result.

Assessment of atopy and measurement of total IgE, CRP, antinuclear antibody (ANA), and anti-thyroid antibody

Atopy was defined as a positive skin test response to at least 1
common inhalant allergen, including pollens, animal dander,
mold, and house dust mites (Allergopharma, Reinbek, Germany).

Total IgE levels were measured using the ImmunoCAP system
(Thermo-Fisher, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. ANA was detected using HEp-2 cells and an
indirect fluorescent antibody technique (Fluoro HEPANA test;
Medical & Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan). Anti-thyroglobulin and thyroid microsomal antibodies were detected by
radioimmunoassay (BRAHMS Aktiengesellschaft, Hennigsdorf,
Germany). Serum CRP (IBL-America, MN, USA) concentrations
were measured by ELISA using commercially available reagents.

used the full analysis set (FAS), which includes all patients who
received at least 1 dose of the assigned treatment, to describe
the study populations included in the urticaria control analysis.
Student’s ¢ test and ANOVA were used for between-group comparisons of continuous variables. Categorical variables were
compared using Pearson’s ¥” test. Mann-Whitney U and Fisher’s exact tests were applied for continuous and categorical
variables in comparison between patients with ASST positivity
and negativity, respectively. Logistic regression was used to examine the effects of various factors on remission or well-controlled CU. The generalized estimating equation was used for
examining the impact of the treatment step on urticaria control
over the study period. The UAS and CU-QolL of the patients
over the study period were examined by repeated-measures
ANOVA according to the ASST results. We used the generalized
estimating equation to evaluate the influence of baseline ASST
results on urticaria control considering treatment step and duration as covariates. A P value of <0.05 was considered to indicate significance. All statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS for Windows version 19.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

RESULTS

Patients

Among a total of 80 patients, 59 patients completed this
6-month prospective observational study. Of the 21 patients
who were withdrawn from the study due to follow-up loss

Prognosis of Chronic Urticaria

(n=14) and withdrawal of consent (n=2), with the exception of
those who did not take medication during the study period
(n=5), 16 were included in the statistical analysis. The baseline
characteristics of 75 study patients whose urticaria control was
evaluated at least once in the study period are shown in Table 1.
The mean age of the patients was 40.5 years, 51 patients (68%)
were female, and 21.9% of the 80 patients had aspirin intolerance. The mean duration of their urticaria symptoms was 37.9
months, and half of the patients had uncontrolled urticaria at
the time of enrollment (Table 1). Of the 63 patients whose IgG
autoantibodies, including anti-thyroid (thyroglobulin and microsomal) and anti-nuclear antibodies, were measured, 21
(33.3%) exhibited a positive result indicating the presence of any
of these 3 autoantibodies. There was no significant difference in
urticaria duration (median, minimum-maximum) before the
enrollment according to the presence of angioedema (13, 2-360
vs 12, 2-120 months, P=0.445), anti-thyroid antibodies (13,
2-240 vs 12, 2-360 months, P=0.840), and a positive ASST (6,
2-108 vs 13, 2-360 months, P=0.122). In 25.4% of patients exhibiting positive ASST results, serum CRP (0.12 £0.33 vs 0.60+0.99
mg/mL, P=0.037) was significantly lower, while peripheral basophil levels (0.82 + 1.24 vs 0.28+0.57%, P= 0.020) were significantly higher than in those with negative ASST results (Table 1).
In addition, the frequency of serum autoantibodies tended to be
increased in patients with positive ASST results (9/17, 52.9%)
than in those with negative ASST results (10/38, 26.3%), although statistical significance (P=0.071) was not reached.

Prognosis of chronic urticaria

After 6 months of prospective observation, 2 (3.4%) and 21
(35.6%) of the 59 patients were determined to have their urticaria in remission and well-controlled states, respectively (Fig.
1). On the contrary, 16.9% of the patients remained at uncontrolled state even with the same stepwise treatment. The mean
time to first well-controlled month was 4.4 months. There were
no significant differences in demographics and clinical parameters among the 4 CU control statuses (Table 2). Two patients
who achieved remission within 6 months had taken antihistamine monotherapy, while 60% of patients with uncontrolled
CU had maintained at least step III treatment, including leukotriene antagonists and/or cyclosporine. In addition, 43.2% of the

patients continuously advanced a treatment step during the
study period. However, 29.7% of the patients maintained the
treatment step at the beginning of the study, and 27.0% were
able to step down over 6 months.

The initial treatment steps of the patients were not different
between groups I and II (Fig. 2) Approximately half of patients
in either group did not have any maintenance treatment for CU
at the enrollment, while 17.4% of group I and 16.7% of group II
had been taking oral corticosteroids for more than 2 weeks.
These results may reflect the lack of awareness about that CU is

a chronic disease whose aim of treatment is a complete symptom control. None of the patients were taking cyclosporine at
the time of enrollment.

Comparison of clinical characteristics according to urticaria
control

Urticaria control state was classified into 2 groups: group I (remission and well-controlled) and group II (partly and uncontrolled). The baseline positive rate of ASST was significantly
higher in group I compared to group II (41.2% vs 11.8%, P=
0.028). Other parameters, including age, urticaria duration,
gender, atopy rate, aspirin intolerance, baseline UAS, and CUQoL were not different between the 2 groups (Table 2). The frequency (2.13.1 vs 0.7+1.8, P=0.034) and total dose (21.74
14.2 vs 5.1+43.1 mg of prednisolone equivalent dose, P=0.045)
of oral corticosteroid use for controlling urticaria exacerbation

of antihistamines, leukotriene antagonist, and cyclosporine,
were not significantly different between the 2 groups. The generalized estimating equation revealed that changes in the pro

Predictors for urticaria control

Table 3 summarizes the independent predictors of urticaria
control in the study subjects. A significant association between
ASST positivity and a better prognosis of CU was reproduced by
a multivariate analysis after the adjustment for age, gender,
baseline UAS and urticaria duration (Table 3). Changes from
baseline in CU-QolL after the 6-month treatment were significantly greater in group I compared to group II (29.9+17.3 vs

ASST results over the study period. Changes in treatment steps
are not remarkable between ASST positive and ASST negative
patients with positive and negative ASST results. Five of the 39
patients with negative ASST results received the step IV treatment in the 6th month. Among them, 1 (20%) patient achieved
well-controlled CU. Two (50%) of the 4 ASST-positive patients
receiving the step IV treatment at the last visit had well-controlled status. The generalized estimating equation demonstrated that a positive ASST (OR=2.648, 95% CI 1.256-5.583,
P=0.011) was a significant determinant of well-controlled CU
at the end of this study even after adjusting for the treatment
step (OR=0.891, 95% CI 0.709-1.121, P=0.325) and treatment
period (OR=1.232, 95% CI 1.086-1.397, P=0.001) as covariates.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we investigated remission and urticaria control
status classified as well, partly, and uncontrolled, as well as factors related to the prognosis of CU using the standard treatment
of 6 months. The CU remission rate within 6 months of stepwise treatment based on recent guidelines’ was 3.4% in the 59
patients. Regardless of their urticaria duration before enrollment in this study, 39% of the patients achieved at least wellcontrolled CU after 6 months. However, 61% of the patients suffered from wheals and pruritus, without a significant difference
in treatment pattern between the 2 groups. Considering that
43.2% of the subjects continuously advanced in treatment steps
during the study period, while 27.0% of patients were able to
tolerate a step-down of treatment, 6 months of observation is
insufficient to determine the exact prognosis of CU. The natural
course of CU is unpredictable, and reported remission rates
vary. In general, CU remission has been achieved in 11.5% to
47.4% of patients at 1 year.*°"""° However, to date, most studies
investigating the prognosis of CU were retrospective,”*”° and
they differ in terms of onset age, disease duration, and previous
treatment step at the enrollment, as well as ethnicity.’

This study suggests a potential use of ASST to predict the control status of CU over a 6-month period of stepwise treatment.
The patients with negative ASST results at enrollment showed
more severe CU in terms of higher CRP levels and more prominent basopenia, which have previously been demonstrated to
be associated with urticaria severity.”"** Additionally, we previously demonstrated a significant association of negative ASST
results with a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome, which
is a chronic, low-grade systemic inflammatory state that coexists in severe CU patients.’ However, these results that patients
with negative ASST results had more severe inflammatory conditions at the beginning of the study suggest a possible limitation in the assessment of the urticaria control under the same
standard stepwise treatment for both ASST positive and negative groups. In addition, considering that some patients who
had a longer disease duration, without statistical significance,

Prognosis of Chronic Urticaria

were included in the ASST negative-group, we could not completely exclude a potential bias in subjects selection. However,
multivariate regression analysis revealed that a positive ASST
was a significant independent predictor of urticaria control
over 6 months of stepwise treatment, whereas no significant
difference was noted in urticaria duration and disease activity.

The UAS was demonstrated to be a good parameter for predicting severe CU refractory to antihistamines in our previous
studies.'°** However, the baseline UAS in this study had no impact on urticaria control, although changes in the UAS were significantly different between groups | and IL. The frequency and
dosage of rescue steroid use during the study in CU patients
were significantly different according to their control status.
These results indicate that both UAS and CU-QoL can be useful
parameters for monitoring the treatment response or control
status in patients with CU.

Angioedema, severe CU, and autoimmunity resulting in positive ASST and anti-thyroid antibodies or hypertension have recently been identified as factors associated with a longer disease duration.®!' However, a recent systematic review revealed
no evidence to support the association between ASST positivity
and a longer duration or disease activity in CU patients.'* Even
though ASST is generally used and well established, variance in
the positivity rate and clinical association of ASST has been issued. The frequency of ASST positivity in CSU patients in this
study (25.4%) is comparable with those of previous studies,'"517°57 There are considerable heterogeneous data on the
prognostic role of ASST reactivity." Previous studies mainly investigated the association between ASST positivity and urticaria duration/disease severity. Some studies showed increased
disease activity or longer duration in ASST positive patients,""*
whereas no significant differences in severity,”’”*’*' disease
duration,”®*"*°* and quality of life scores*! between the ASSTpositive and ASST-negative patients were noted in others. However, there has been no attempt to study on whether ASST reactivity can predict urticaria control status and therapeutic response in CSU patients. Staubach et al.*' reported that ASSTpositive CU patients require more antihistamines; however,
their results were based on retrospective observation without
further steps of treatment. In this study, we demonstrated that
ASST positivity was a significant predictor of well-controlled CU
during the 6-month stepwise treatment after adjusting for urticaria duration in a multivariate regression model considering
the treatment step and duration as covariates in the generalized
estimating equation.

When we analyzed time from the onset of symptoms to enrollment in this study, the time appeared to be longer in patients having angioedema, anti-thyroid antibodies, and negative ASST results, albeit not significantly so. Additionally, the
presence of angioedema or anti-thyroid autoantibodies had no
impact on the control status of urticaria in previous studies. In
contrast, our study demonstrated that the mean UAS and CU

QoL over the study period were more favorable in patients with
positive ASST results as compared to those with negative ASST
results. However, due to the limitations associated with the
small number of patients, further prospective studies with a
longer time frame using stepwise treatment are necessary to
evaluate the clinical utility of ASST and to investigate other factors for predicting the prognosis of CU.

Since only half of the ASST-positive sera induced histamine
release from donor basophils, ASST results were suggested to
indicate the presence of vasoactive factors other than IgG autoantibodies able to activate basophils.’*’*’ Serum factors present
in CU patients are associated with ASST reactivity, and their
role in the course of disease remains to be elucidated. We speculate that patients with positive ASST results have serum factors
that enable the release of histamine and vasodilators that were
controlled by antihistamines, whereas sera from ASST-negative
patients may contain inflammatory mediators, such as CRP,
that perpetuate inflammation rather than histamine-releasing
factors. Therefore, the majority of ASST-positive patients whose
urticaria symptoms are induced mainly by histamine are expected to achieve a well-controlled state within 6 months of
treatment. Since exacerbating and triggering factors in CU patients are heterogeneous, it is unclear whether urticaria control
state assessed at the end of the 6-month period would be maintained in the long term. It is another limitation of our study not
to evaluate whether functional histamine releasability of the
sera from our study patients was different according to the
ASST results. Therefore, further studies are needed to validate
the association between ASST reactivity and the long-term
prognosis of CU.

In conclusion, a 6-month stepwise treatment approach based
on the recent guidelines induced a remission of 3.4% of patients
from urticaria, and 35.6% of the 59 CU patients were able to
achieve well-controlled status. Changes in the UAS and CUQoL from baseline levels are well correlated with CU control. A
positive ASST has been identified as an independent predictor
of well-controlled CU. However, future studies should investigate which serum factors that induce ASST reactivity in CU patients are involved in the therapeutic response.
