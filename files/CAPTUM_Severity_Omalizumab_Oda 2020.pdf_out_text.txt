What is already known about this topic? Basophil functional abnormalities such as the low-responsiveness of basophils
via high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) were reported in chronic spontaneous urticaria. Moreover, several studies reported
increased FceRI-mediated histamine release after omalizumab treatment.

What does this article add to our knowledge? Improvement of attenuated basophil responsiveness via FceRI stimu
lation in chronic spontaneous urticaria is associated with rapid clinical effectiveness, and the mechanism of action of
omalizumab might be due to improved responsiveness of newly circulating basophils.

How does this study impact current management guidelines? Changes in basophil responsiveness via FceRI stimulation in some patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria before and after omalizumab treatment suggest the importance
of basophil status as an action point of omalizumab treatment.

 

BACKGROUND: Omalizumab is effective in patients with
chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) although its mechanism of
action is poorly understood. Several studies reported that
decreased high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI)-mediated histamine
release and/or responsiveness was characteristic of basophils in
patients with CSU. However, few studies have focused on the
relationship between changes in basophil responsiveness via
FceRI after omalizumab treatment and the therapeutic effect in
patients with CSU.

OBJECTIVE: To assess basophil responsiveness via FceRI
stimulation, as well as FceRI expression and IgE binding on
blood basophils from patients with CSU before and after
omalizumab treatment and its possible association with the
clinical response.

METHODS: We analyzed 34 patients with CSU treated with
omalizumab who were categorized as fast responders (FRs)

(n = 20) and non or slow responders (N/SRs) (n = 14).

CD203c expression induced by FceRI stimulation, and IgE and
FceRI expressions on blood basophils from patients with CSU
before and after omalizumab treatment were analyzed. Basophil
responsiveness via FceRI stimulation was observed in vitro using
basophils pretreated with omalizumab.

RESULTS: FRs had increased CD203c responsiveness after
treatment with omalizumab compared with N/SRs. This
improvement of basophil responsiveness via FceRI stimulation
in FRs was not observed in peripheral blood basophils
preincubated with omalizumab in vitro, suggesting that
omalizumab does not directly affect circulating pre-existing
abnormal basophils.

CONCLUSION: Increased basophil responsiveness via FceRI
after omalizumab treatment is associated with the therapeutic
effect and mechanism of action of omalizumab. © 2020

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is characterized by the
spontaneous appearance of wheals, angioedema, or both for more
than 6 weeks and is associated with known (autoreactivity) or
unknown causes.’ Although the pathophysiology of CSU is
unclear, basophils have been increasingly recognized as having
critical roles and some investigators have described an association
between disease pathophysiology and basophil function and
number in CSU.

Several reports documented that circulating basophils from
patients with CSU released less histamine than healthy controls
(HCs) when stimulated with anti-IgE antibody or anti—highaffinity IgE receptor (FceRI) antibody.” Furthermore, reduced
CD63 expression on basophils after anti-FceRI stimulation was

reported in a subgroup of patients with CSU compared with HC
basophils.° In our previous study,” basophils from patients with
CSU had attenuated upregulation of the activation marker
CD203c against IgE and FceRI antibodies compared with
basophils from HCs, and the attenuated basophil responsiveness
in patients with CSU was associated with the severity of disease
and a relatively shorter disease duration. In addition, Huang
et al® reported that basophil nonresponders (<10% of total
histamine release to IgE) and basopenics (histamine concentrations <5 ng/mL blood leukocytes) have more severe, but shorter
disease compared with responders.

Patients with CSU have unique features related to basophil
number as well as basophil function and responsiveness in the
circulating blood. Rorsman’ first described a reduction of peripheral blood basophils in patients with CSU. Subsequently,
basopenia was reported to be correlated with urticaria
activity. ‘11 Purthermore, basophils were reported to be present
in skin lesions of urticaria at levels higher than in nonlesion
skin.'” These findings suggest that basopenia may reflect the
recruitment of basophils to skin tissues. Although basophil
migration was investigated in previous studies,'°'* the recruitment pathway remains unknown.

Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized anti-IgE monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the C3 domain of IgE,
thereby blocking the binding of IgE to high-affinity receptors on
effector cells and inhibiting IgE-mediated cellular responses.'”
Omalizumab has been approved for use in patients with CSU
who remain symptomatic despite H1 antihistamine treatment.
Although omalizumab binds to free IgE, which lowers free IgE
levels and causes FceRI receptors on basophils and mast cells to
be internalized and degraded, the mechanism of action in CSU is
not understood completely.'°’'” Several reports demonstrated
changes in basophil number and function after treatment with
omalizumab. Furthermore, the numbers of circulating blood
basophils increased after omalizumab treatment’ ® in parallel with
clinical improvement.'””?° With respect to basophil function,
Gericke et al'® reported increased anti—IgE-induced histamine
release from blood basophils of patients with CSU treated with
omalizumab compared with baseline value. In contrast, it was
reported that CD63-based basophil “releasability” by IL-3
coincubation after stimulation with anti-IgE antibody was

decreased after omalizumab treatment compared with baseline
values.*!

Many reports have described pretreatment biomarkers to
predict the efficacy of omalizumab in CSU. Palacios et al’?
reported a lack of basophil CD203c upregulation in serum,
which might reflect a lack of autoantibodies to IgE and/or FceRI
but which correlated with a higher clinical response. Similarly,
Deza et al” showed that a higher rate of positive Autologous
Serum Skin Test (ASST) was associated with insufficient therapeutic effect. Gericke et al’ showed that a positive basophil
histamine release assay or ASST as an indicator of serum
autoreactivity was predictive of a slow response to treatment with
omalizumab. In addition, baseline levels of basophil FceRI
expression were significantly lower in nonresponders to
omalizumab~’ and higher in fast responders (FRs) than in slow
responders.’ Omalizumab responsiveness was also predicted by
total serum IgE levels*® and changes in total serum IgE levels.””
Furthermore, Altrichter et al?° observed that reduced serum IL31 was associated with omalizumab responses. However, few
studies have focused on the relationship between baseline and/or
altered basophil responsiveness via FceRI, as well as IgE and
FceRI expression on basophils and the omalizumab therapeutic
effect in patients with CSU.

Therefore, the current study analyzed the expression of
CD203c via FceRI stimulation, as well as IgE and FceRI
expression on basophils from patients with CSU before and after
omalizumab treatment and its possible association with the
clinical response. Moreover, we examined these parameters as a
potential predictor of responses to omalizumab therapy. In
addition, we performed an in vitro study using FR basophils
pretreated with omalizumab whether omalizumab could affect
basophil reactivity in short-term incubation.

 

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Study population

Thirty-four patients with CSU who remained symptomatic
despite H1-antihistamines (even up to 2 times the recommended
dose in Japan) and who were treated with omalizumab were enrolled
at the Dermatological Institute of Kobe University Hospital. CSU
was defined as recurrent wheals occurring for more than 6 weeks
without an identifiable cause. Omalizumab 300 mg was injected

 

subcutaneously at least 3 times at 4-week intervals. Clinical variables
were evaluated using the Urticaria Control Test (UCT), which is an
outcome instrument to retrospectively assess urticaria control with a
recommended cutoff value of 12 for controlled disease.”? It was
reported that the UCT has a strong correlation with the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)”? and 7-day Urticaria Activity
Score (UAS7).°' UCT scores were measured at day 0, and on weeks
4, 8, and 12 of treatment (ie, before the Ist, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th
injections). Patients were categorized into FRs (n = 20) and non or
slow responders (N/SRs) (n = 14) (Figure El, available in this
article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org) (Table 1)
based. on the following criteria: FRs with UCT scores >12 up on
week 4 (Figure E2, A, available in this article’s Online Repository at
www.jaci-inpractice.org); and N/SRs with UCT scores <12 up on
week 4 (Figure E2, B, available in this article’s Online Repository at
www.jaci-inpractice.org). UAS7 could be measured in some patients,

 

and the data are presented in Figure E2, C and D (available in this
article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org). In addition,
we classified patients into good responders (GRs) (n = 26) and non

weeks but could not follow up until 12 weeks. Therefore, this
patient was excluded from the GRs versus N/PRs dataset. All study
participants provided oral consent for this study after verbal and
written explanations.

Basophil activation test

Whole blood was taken just before the first and second omalizumab administration using blood collection tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and assays were performed
within 24 hours of blood sampling. The Allergenicity Kit (Beckman
Coulter, Fullerton, CA) was modified and used for the quantification of basophil CD203c expression as previously described.” Basophils were stimulated with anti-IgE antibody (clone: E124-2-8D)
(0.1 pg/mL) (Beckman Coulter), VioBlue-conjugated anti-IgE
antibody (clone: MB10-5C4) (1.1 [ig/mL) (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), or biotinylated anti-FceRI antibody
(clone: CRA1) (16 [lg/mL) (BioAcademia, Osaka, Japan). Basophils
incubated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were used as a
negative control.

Briefly, blood was stained with reagents consisting of CRTH2FITC, CD203c-PE, and CD3-PC7 to identify basophils, and

were then mixed with the respective stimulant or PBS at 37°C for 15

 

minutes. Biotinylated antibodies against CRA1 were then coupled
with APC streptavidin (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) at 4°C for 30
minutes. Erythrocytes were lysed, and after washing twice with PBS,
cells were resuspended in 0.3 mL PBS 0.1% formaldehyde and
evaluated 500 basophils by flow cytometry (FACS verse; BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

Flow cytometry results were analyzed by FlowJo software
(FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, OR). Results of antibody stimulation were
expressed as a proportion of CD203c!"" basophils. The roportion
of CD203c* basophils was determined using a threshold defined

as the expression level above which only 5% of basophils in the

 

negative control sample fluoresced.’* Changes in basophil responsiveness via FceRI stimulation after omalizumab treatment compared
with before treatment were calculated as follows. The after/before
treatment ratio of basophil CD203c responsiveness was defined as

CD203c"8" basophil (%) stimulated with each antibody after

 

treatment/CD203ci#" basophil (%) stimulated with each antibody
before treatment.

Measurement of IgE and FceRI levels on basophils
Basophils were incubated with VioBlue-conjugated anti-IgE
antibody (clone: MB10-5C4; Miltenyi Biotec) and biotinylated antiFceRI antibody (clone: CRA1; BioAcademia) and analyzed by flow
cytometry using the same method as for IgE and FceRI levels on
basophils and FlowJo analysis using the same method as for basophil
activation after anti-lgE or CRA1 antibody stimulation. IgE and
FceRI levels were evaluated as the mean fluorescence intensity
(MFI). Changes in IgE and FceRI levels on basophils after omalizumab treatment compared with before treatment were calculated as
follows: AIgE expression (AFceRI expression): IgE levels (FceRI

levels) on basophils before treatment — after treatment.

In vitro study using basophils pretreated with
omalizumab

Whole blood obtained from 2 patients with CSU before omalizumab administration using blood collection tubes containing
EDTA was incubated for 1, 12, or 24 hours at room temperature
with 30 [g/mL omalizumab (Novartis Pharma, Tokyo, Japan).*?
Samples with/without omalizumab preincubation were measured
for CD203c expression after stimulation with anti-IgE antibody
(clone: E124-2-8D, MB10-5C4). Results of antibody stimulation
were expressed as the proportion of CD203c"8" basophils and IgE

 

levels on basophils were expressed as the MFI, and sequential
changes were investigated.

Serum total IgE levels and basophil counts

Serum total IgE measured by the IgEradioimmunosorbent test. Numbers of blood basophils (/[1L) were
assessed by an automated analyzer in the laboratory of the Kobe
University Graduate School of Medicine.

Changes in total serum IgE levels and basophil counts on baso
levels were

phils after omalizumab treatment compared with before treatment
were calculated as follows: Atotal serum IgE (Abasophil counts):
total serum levels (basophil counts) after treatment — before
treatment.

Statistical analysis

The nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-test, unpaired ¢-test, and
Fischer’s exact test were used to assess differences between GRs and
N/PRs. The Kruskal-Wallis result with the Dunn test was used for

comparing 3 groups of nonparametric variables.

RESULTS
Study population

Patients with CSU were categorized into 2 subgroups based
on UCT scores 4 weeks after omalizumab treatment. Twenty of
34 patients (58.8%) who achieved significant clinical improvement (UCT scores >12) were classified as FRs and the remaining
14 (41.1%) who did not achieve significant clinical improvement
(UCT scores <12) were classified as N/SRs (Figure E1, available
in this article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org).
The baseline clinical characteristics of these subgroups are
described in Table I. They exhibited no significant differences
regarding sex, age, disease duration, serum IgE levels, and
basophil counts. In addition, there were no significant differences
regarding the ASST positive rate in contrast to a previous
study.** There were no differences among the 2 groups with
respect to the baseline UCT, UAS7, or DLQI score. In addition,
although we divided patients with CSU into GRs and N/PRs
based on UCT scores on week 12 after treatment of omalizumab,

 

there were no differences in serum IgE and ASST when
comparing GRs and N/PRs (Table E1, available in this article’s
Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org). However, it was
noted that 1 patient among N/PRs did not have data of total
serum IgE before treatment and the patient was excluded from
the GRs versus N/PRs dataset (Table E1, available in this article’s
Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org).
Baseline FceRI
stimulation
Although several studies described biomarkers for therapeutic
responses to omalizumab,””?*"°"* few studies have focused on
basophil responsiveness via FceRI as a predictor of the thera
basophil responsiveness via

peutic response to omalizumab. Therefore, we analyzed the
baseline expression of the activation marker CD203c with or
without anti-IgE and/or FceRI stimulation in patients with CSU.
The expression of CD203c on peripheral blood basophils from
patients with CSU in the steady state without anti-IgE and/or
FceRI stimulation was similar between FRs and N/SRs
(Figure E3, available in this article’s Online Repository at www.
jaci-inpractice.org). There were no differences in the percentage
of CD203chish basophils stimulated with anti-IgE (E124-2-8D,
MB-105C4) and FceRI (CRA1) antibody between groups
(Figure 1). Thus, basophil responsiveness via FceRI stimuli did
not predict the treatment response with omalizumab.

Furthermore, we classified patients with CSU into 2 groups
based on the baseline proportion CD203cM" basophils after
anti-IgE stimulation as in the previous report” (14 nonresponders
[<10% CD203ch8" basophil] and 20 responders [>10%
CD203chie" basophil]) (Figure E4, available in this article’s
Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org). However, there
were no differences in fast or good effectiveness of omalizumab
between nonresponders and responders.

Improvement in basophil responsiveness via FceRI
stimulation after omalizumab treatment

It was previously demonstrated that blood basophil histamine
release tended to increase with anti-IgE stimulation after
omalizumab treatment compared with baseline.'® In this study,
we compared CD203c responsiveness of basophils via FceRI
stimulation with anti-IgE and FceRI antibody before and after
omalizumab treatment. The percentage of CD203ch8* basophils
stimulated with any antibody increased in many FRs but not in
most N/SRs (Figure E5 and Table E2, available in this article’s
Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org). Therefore, we
compared the after/before treatment ratio of basophil CD203c
responsiveness via FceRI between FRs and N/SRs. When peripheral blood basophils were stimulated with 3 types of antibody, the after/before treatment ratio was significantly higher in
FRs than in N/SRs (Figure 2; Figure E5, available in this article’s

 

Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org). Furthermore, the
after/before ratio was around 1.5 to 2.0 for the anti-IgE antibody
in FRs, but around 4 for the anti-FceRI antibody (Figure 2).
These data suggest that omalizumab improved basophil responsiveness via FceRI in FRs but not in N/SRs and that the
improvement effect was associated with the rapid therapeutic
response of omalizumab. However, it was needed to note that
FRs included a group with improved basophil responsiveness and
a group with no improvement, and N/SRs included some patients with improved basophil responsiveness (Figure E5, available in this articles Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.
org).

Baseline IgE and FceRI levels of basophils

Previous reports showed that the treatment effect of omalizumab may be predicted by serum IgE levels.°°*” We previously
reported that serum IgE levels were strongly correlated with IgE
or FceRI expression on basophils from patients with CSU’ and
the correlations were also observed in overall participants of this
study (Figure E6, available in this article’s Online Repository at
www.jaci-inpractice.org). Therefore, we investigated whether
baseline basophil IgE expression was associated with the therapeutic response. No significant difference in IgE and FceRI
(CRA1) expression between FRs and N/SRs was observed
(Figure 3, A and B). However, when patients with CSU were

categorized into GRs and N/PRs using the UCT score 12 weeks
after omalizumab treatment, IgE expression on basophils from
GRs was higher than that from N/PRs, whereas there was no
difference in serum IgE between GRs and N/PRs (Figure 3, G
Table El, available in this article’s Online Repository at www.
jaci-inpractice.org). However, it was noted that 1 patient
among N/PRs did not have data of total serum IgE before
treatment and the patient was excluded from the GRs versus N/
PRs dataset (Table El, available in this article’s Online
Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org). In addition, there was no
difference in FceRI (CRA1) expression between GRs and N/PRs
(Figure 3, D).

Changes in IgE and FceRI levels on basophils after
omalizumab treatment

It is widely accepted that omalizumab neutralizes free IgE and
subsequently suppresses FceRI and surface IgE expression on
circulating basophils.'’ Deza et al” reported that patients
exhibiting significant clinical improvement had a marked
reduction in the levels of basophil FceRI after 4 weeks. On the
basis of these findings, we evaluated the association between
changes in basophil FceRI and IgE levels after omalizumab
treatment and the therapeutic effect. AlgE expression (IgE levels
on basophils before treatment — after treatment) was not

different between FRs and N/SRs (Figure 4, A). In contrast to a
previous report, > there was no difference in AFceRI (CRA1)
expression between the 2 groups (Figure 4, B). However, AlgE
expression was higher in GRs than N/PRs (Figure 4, C), whereas
there was no difference in AFceRI (CRA1) expression between
the 2 groups (Figure 4, D). These data indicate a more efficient
inhibition of IgE binding on basophils in GRs than in N/PRs
after omalizumab administration.

Changes in serum total IgE levels and basophil
counts

Low serum IgE levels that increased after the start of
omalizumab treatment were associated with insufficient clinical
responses.” In addition, Saini et al!’ showed that improved
basopenia was associated with reduced clinical symptoms. Thus,
we evaluated the potential association between changes in serum
IgE levels and circulating basophil counts in the blood after
treatment with omalizumab and the therapeutic effect. When
patients with CSU were categorized into FRs and N/SRs, no
differences in Aserum total IgE and Abasophil counts were
observed between the groups (Figure 5, A and B). When patients
with CSU were categorized into GRs and N/PRs, Aserum total
IgE and Abasophil counts just tended to be higher with no
significant difference (Figure 5, C and D). However, 3 patients

Different effects of omalizumab on_ basophil
responsiveness via FceRI stimulation in vivo and
in vitro

Finally, we investigated whether the responsiveness of basophils via FceRI improved before omalizumab administration by
incubating basophils from patients with CSU with omalizumab
in vitro to clarify the mechanism of action of omalizumab.
Increased basophil responsiveness via FceRI after in vivo
omalizumab treatment was observed for cells isolated from the 2
FRs used in this study (Figure 6, A and B). However, improved
basophil responsiveness via FceRI stimulation was not observed
at any time despite pretreatment with omalizumab in vitro
(Figure 6, C and D). These data suggest that pre-existing
circulating basophils that exhibited low responsiveness via
FceRI before omalizumab administration did not have improved
function after in vitro omalizumab treatment.

DISCUSSION

Basophils have unique features and play a critical role in CSU.
It was reported that basophils from patients with CSU released
less histamine and/or exhibited low responsiveness when stimulated via FceRI compared with basophils from HCs.*’ We
recently reported that the low responsiveness of basophils via
FceRI reflected severe disease activity in CSU.” In addition to the
functional abnormalities of basophils, basopenia was correlated
with disease activity in CSU''! and the cutaneous lesion
recruitment of basophils in CSU. Although omalizumab was
effective in most patients with CSU who remained symptomatic
despite H1 antihistamine treatment, its mechanism of action in
CSU is poorly understood. In the current study, we focused on
basophils as a predictive marker of the clinical effectiveness of
omalizumab and as a component of the mechanism of action of
omalizumab. We classified and compared patients with CSU into
2 groups, FRs and N/SRs or GRs and N/PRs, based on the
clinical efficacy of omalizumab 4 or 12 weeks after treatment
with omalizumab.

First, we focused on baseline parameters before omalizumab
treatment as a pretreatment predictive marker of the clinical
effectiveness of omalizumab. Baseline CD203c responsiveness
after stimulation with anti-IgE and FceRI antibodies was not a
useful pretreatment predictive marker, which is similar for the

CD63-based report from Alizadeh Aghdam et al“ (Figure 1).
However, baseline IgE expression on basophils from GRs before
omalizumab treatment was higher than that in basophils from N/
PRs (Figure 3, C). This difference was not observed between FRs
and N/SRs (Figure 3, A). These observations suggested that
higher IgE expression on basophils might predict a significant
therapeutic effect 12 weeks after omalizumab treatment, even if

the therapeutic effect was insufficient 4 weeks after treatment. In

contrast to previous reports, there were no differences in
baseline FceRI expression on basophils between FRs and N/SRs
before omalizumab treatment (Figure 3, B). This difference may
be related to differences in the definition of treatment response.
In addition, a good predictor of N/PRs was found on surface IgE
(Figure 3, C), but not serum IgE (Table El, available in this
article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org). Howeyer, serum IgE strongly correlated with surface IgE on basophils
(Figure E6, available in this article’s Online Repository at www.
jaci-inpractice.org). The difference of results between the

previous studies that serum IgE was a good baseline

predictor of omalizumab treatment efficacy and this study may
be dependent on the small number of samples in this study.
Next, we investigated changes in basophil parameters and IgE
after omalizumab treatment to determine their contribution to
the mechanism of action of omalizumab in CSU. Regarding
changes in basophil parameters, the after/before treatment ratios
of basophil responsiveness (CD203c response) were significantly
higher in FRs compared with N/SRs (Figure 2), suggesting that
the improvement of low responsiveness in circulating basophils
via FceRI was related to the rapid therapeutic effect of omalizumab. In addition, the after/before ratio was around 1.5 to 2.0
for the anti-IgE antibody in FRs, but around 4 for the anti-FceRI
antibody. It has been reported that during treatment with
omalizumab, spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) expression increases in
peripheral blood basophils, offsetting the functional effects
mediated by the drug-induced reduction in cell surface density of
FceRI and its bound IgE.*” Basophils that recovered functionally

after omalizumab treatment might promote Syk signal more
strongly when stimulated with anti-FceRI than when stimulated
with anti-IgE.

CD203c upregulation after anti-IgE stimulation was demonstrated to be earlier than CD63 upregulation. *° In addition, Ebo
et al’ mentioned that upregulation of CD203c does not per se
indicate histamine release and CD203c is not a degranulation
marker like CD63. Thus, increased CD203c response to the IgE
concentration after treatment of omalizumab observed in the
current study does not mean an increase in histamine release.
Alizadeh Aghdam et al” reported that when CD63 expression
on basophils was used as a biomarker in the omalizumab
responder, a significant increase after stimulation of the anti-IgE
antibody was observed in nonresponders after omalizumab
treatment, contrary to no increase in responders. This difference
from our study might be due to differences in the markers between CD203c and CD63 or to the definition of responder and
nonresponder. Indeed, Alizadeh Aghdam et al’ evaluated disease
activity in 6 months. Contrary, we evaluate the effectiveness in 1
month and 3 months.

The reduction of IgE expression on basophils 4 weeks after
omalizumab treatment was larger in GRs compared with N/
PRs (Figure 4, C). Regarding the changes in serum IgE,
increased serum IgE levels 4 weeks after omalizumab treatment
tended to be higher in GRs than in N/PRs (Figure 5, C). These
differences were not observed between FRs and N/SRs
(Figures 4, A, and 5, A). Based on these results related to IgE,

the larger reduction of IgE expression on basophils and the
higher increase of serum IgE levels 4 weeks after omalizumab
treatment suggested that good clinical responses were achieved
12 weeks after omalizumab treatment, even if they were not
achieved 4 weeks after treatment. Moreover, these data imply
that omalizumab efficiently inhibited the binding of IgE to
basophils by binding to free serum IgE in GRs compared with
N/PRs, which was the cause of the increase in apparent serum
IgE levels in GRs.

Whether this improvement of basophil responsiveness by
omalizumab treatment acts directly on low responsive circulating
basophils before omalizumab treatment is an important issue
related to the mechanism of action of omalizumab in CSU.
Finally, we investigated whether omalizumab acted directly on
circulating basophils in FRs before treatment in vitro. An
improvement of basophil responsiveness via FceRI stimulation
was not observed at any time despite im vitro omalizumab
treatment (Figure 6, Cand D). These data indicate that in FRs,
the functions of pre-existing basophils that exhibited low
responsiveness via FceRI stimulation before omalizumab
treatment could not be improved. In contrast, iv vivo treatment
with omalizumab in these cases improved basophil responsiveness via FceRI stimulation and induced a rapid and good clinical
response (Figure 6, A and B). These differences between in vitro
and in vivo omalizumab treatment suggest that newly circulating
basophils, possibly from skin tissue or bone marrow, maintained
normal function in the blood under the state of low IgE binding

to their surface by the efficient formation of an immune complex
with omalizumab and serum IgE. Indeed, it was reported that the
life span of mature basophils is approximately 60 to 70 hours.*®
A recent review proposed that basophils in patients with CSU are
mildly activated, persistently release a small amount of histamine,
and are involved in the earliest stages of the cascade of CSU
pathogenesis.”

This study includes limitations about grouping. The main
focus of this study was to observe differences in basophil
responsiveness between FRs and other groups (N/SRs) at 4
weeks after treatment. However, because we considered that
the comparison of FRs and N/SRs alone was not enough to
evaluate scientific fairly, we added the comparison data of GRs
and N/PRs using another classification method. It would be
ideal if the NRs could be independent for comparison, but the
number of NRs is overwhelmingly small as in the existing reports and larger-scale research is needed for this comparison. In
addition, we used only 1 concentration antibody to stimulate
the basophils and might have missed a curve shift of basophil
reactivity.

In summary, improvement of attenuated basophil responsiveness via FceRI stimulation in patients with CSU was
associated with the rapid clinical effectiveness of omalizumab.
However, further research is needed to elucidate the role of
basophils in the mechanism of action of omalizumab in CSU.
Although this study had some limitations, including a small
number of cases, it highlights the importance of basophil status
as an action point of omalizumab in CSU.

ASST, Autologous Serum Skin Test; DLQ/, Dermatology Life Quality Index; GR, good responder; N/PR, non or partial responder; SD, standard deviation; UAS7, 7-day
Urticaria Activity Score; UCT, Urticaria Control Test.
Data are given as the mean + SD for age, UCT, and UAST; n (%) for sex, ASST positive rate; median (range) for disease duration, serum total IgE, basophil counts, and DLQI.
Statistical differences between 2 groups were analyzed by the unpaired t-test for age, UCT, and UAS7; Fisher’s exact test for female and ASST positive rate; and the MannWhitney U-test for disease duration, serum total IgE, basophil counts, and DLQI.
One patient among N/PRs did not have data of total serum IgE and basophil count before treatment and the patient was excluded from the GRs vs N/PRs dataset.
