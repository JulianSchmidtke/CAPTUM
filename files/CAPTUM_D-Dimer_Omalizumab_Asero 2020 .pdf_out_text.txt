Omalizumab is the first choice treatment for severe chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) patients who are
unresponsive to second-generation antihistamines even at higher than licensed dose (1). The drug ‘=
effective in about 85% of patients, inducing a dramatic drop in UAS7 levels. The clinical effec. ca. te very
rapid (in about 70% of patients, the so-called early or fast responders, the effect may ape... as early as 3-5
days after the first administration), or slow (in about 15% of patients, the so-called la ¢ or slow responders,
3-4 months of treatment are needed to see a benefit). The drug is ineffective in *+e 1 “maining 15% (2).
Several recent studies have shown the association between elevated baseline .>tat IgE levels and a positive
response to omalizumab, with non-responders showing significantly lover 1; E (3-5). A possible “autoallergic” pathogenesis mediated by IgE specific for self-proteins may “easonably explain a rapid response to
omalizumab in some patients with CSU (6,7). In contrast, the .eas-ns why a proportion of patients take
months to respond to the drug are less clar. This subpopul=.:+n might coincide with patients showing an
IgG-mediated autoimmune process able to activate mz st -e'ls and basophils via the high affinity IgE
receptor, either directly (by lgG-anti-FceRI) or indi: -tly \by IgG directed against receptor-bound IgE) (8,9).
In this case, the effect of omalizumab would rr iy 9" t1.2 down-regulation of IgE receptors, a process that
would take some months (10). From the cli ‘ical point of view, patients showing a rapid or slow response to
omalizumab have not been compared <o .>:. The present study investigated the clinical and selorogical

features in these two subsets of CSU pauients.

One hundred and thirty pai. ~nt. (M/F 53/77; mean age 50,6 years (range 13-89 years) with severe CSU
(UAS-7 > 30) unrespons’.e tu second generation antihistamines at any dosage and successfully submitted
to treatment with C n-.,umab 300 mg/month for at least 3 months were studied. Based on their response
to Omalizumab, , atie nts were classified as early responders (drop of at least 50% of UAS-7 from baseline
level alreadv 1 “onth after the first administration; n=108) and late responders (no appreciable clinical
effect 1.> n.unth after the first administration, but drop of at least 50% of baseline UAS-7 after 3 months of
treatn.2nt; n= 22). Age, sex, disease duration, and several baseline clinical parameters including ESR, CRP,

thyroid autoimmunity, total IgE , D-dimer, and atopic status (as assessed by SPT with a large panel of
commercial extracts of both seasonal and perennial respiratory allergens) were compared between the two
subsets. The chi-square test with Yates’ correction, the two-tailed Student’s t-test, or the Mann-Whitney
non-parametric test were used where appropriate. Probability values less than 5% were regarded a.
statistically significant. The internal review board approved the study, and all the patients sigi.>d an

informed consent to use their clinical data in an anonymous form.

The study subpopulations are compared in table 1. The two groups did not diff.~ ir, sender, mean age,
disease duration, atopic status, inflammation markers, and thyroid autoimmu. ty. |\; contrast, early
responders showed a significantly higher proportion of patients showing ele. at d (> 100 Ul/ml) baseline
total IgE (67% vs 33%, respectively; p < 0.05). Of those showing elevated tv’ 4l IgE at baseline, only 16/41
(39%) and 2/5 (40%) were atopic among early and late responder., . ~spectively. Although median total IgE
levels were much higher among early responders (181 UI/ml vs 42 !U/ml for early and late responders,

respectively), probably due to the small number of late re.1on xers the difference between the two

subgroups did not reach the statistical significance.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first st:'dy -omparing the clinical features of the two specific
subsets of CSU patients responding to anti- gE therapy, namely the early and late responders. The two
subsets of omalizumab responders were virt ially identical with the only difference of a much larger
proportion of patients showing elevat.d .gE levels in the early responders group. This observation is in
keeping with previous studies .1.>wiig the direct relationship between elevated IgE levels and the response
to anti-IgE treatment in th : ge.ere! CSU population (3-5). It is conceivable that in these patients elevated
total IgE may mirror the ore disposition to synthesize autoreactive IgE antibodies that the anti-IgE mAb
rapidly binds and .'imi- ates from the circulation. It has also been shown that omalizumab is able to bind
IgE fixed to thz..‘ch affinity receptor and to detach them (11), which leads (in a long term) to a downregulatior co. ve receptor. In patients showing a slow response to the omalizumab it is possible that this
lat’ >» mechanism of action is the most important. In effect, a very recent study seems to suggest that the
contemporary presence of IgE and lgG-mediated autoimmunity (particularly against the high affinity IgE

receptor) may slow down the clinical response to the drug (12).
