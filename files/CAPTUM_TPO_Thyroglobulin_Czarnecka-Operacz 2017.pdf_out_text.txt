Abstract

Introduction: Chronic urticaria (CU) is a skin disease caused by autoantibodies against high affinity immunoglobulin E
(IgE) receptor and against IgE. It is characterized by hives, erythematous wheals and redness present minimum
twice a week for at least 6 weeks. It is observed that there is a strong association between CU and autoimmune
diseases, such as autoimmune thyroiditis (AT).

Aim: To verify the frequency of AT in patients suffering from chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and to confirm
the coexistence of CU and AT in the Polish population.

Material and methods: One hundred and forty-eight patients with CSU were included to the study. The presence of
anti-thyroperoxydase antibodies (anti-TPO) and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (anti-Tg) was checked and thyrotropin
(TSH), free thyroxine (fT4) and free triiodothyronine (fT3) concentration was measured. Results were compared with
outcomes in a group of 35 patients with no history of skin disease.

Results: Thirty-three patients were diagnosed with AT. Frequency of elevated anti-TPO (p = 0.0045) and anti-Tg (p =
0.013) levels was much higher in patients with CU. A comparison of the current study and previous ones was conducted. In a group with CU, there was a higher risk of elevated anti-TPO (OR = 6.69) and anti-Tg (OR = 6.01) levels.
Conclusions: There is a statistically significant difference in the presence of AT between the patients with CU and
the whole population. Doctors should consider examining patients with CU for AT. Adequate therapy and guidance
for patients could be implemented at an early stage of thyroid disease and help induce remission of skin disorders.

Key words: chronic urticaria, autoimmune thyroiditis, thyroid, anti-thyroperoxydase antibodies, anti-thyroglobulin

antibodies, autoimmunity.

Introduction

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common skin disease,
which affects about 0.1-1% of the population [1]. Urticaria
affects 15-25% of people at least once in their lifetime
[2]. It is diagnosed using criteria including hives, persistent or transitory widespread erythematous wheals
with itching and redness present minimum twice a week
for at least 6 weeks [1, 3]. In about 60% of patients presenting characteristic lesions, the disorder is associated
with serological factors. It is related to higher immunoglobulin E (IgE) production and T-cell induced cytokine
production, secretion of vasoactive substances such as
histamine, prostaglandins, kinins and other proinflammatory substances [1, 2, 4, 5]. In about 55% of cases of
CU (excluding CU with known pathogenesis), the spon
taneous type is confirmed, 45% of the patients present
an autoimmune type, called chronic autoimmune urticaria. Now it is known that CU is caused by the autoimmune process with the presence in 10-40% of cases of
circulating IgG autoantibodies against the high affinity
IgE receptor (FceR1) and less commonly (in 5-10%) with
IgG antibodies against IgE or IgG antibodies linking to
34 kD @ subunit of the IgE receptor [6-8]. Those autoantibodies cause an activation of basophiles and mast cells,
secretion of histamine and infiltration of cells connected
with inflammation. Less patients have some factors that
can cause a mastocyte degranulation, but they have not
been found yet. Furthermore, in patients with chronic
spontaneous urticaria (CSU), in about 25-30% of cases,
the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies was revealed and

Hashimoto disease was diagnosed [9]. This group has
a higher frequency of DR alleles, which are connected
with autoimmunity, and is more exposed to severity of
CU [8]. Patients with CU and thyroid autoimmunity (TA)
have a higher risk of angioedema and because of that
they require specific treatment [10].

Autoimmune thyroiditis (AT) is the most common
inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland. It is proven
that Hashimoto disease is a polygenic disorder, in which
genetic, environmental and infectious factors play a role
in its pathogenesis [11].

Aim

The aim of a study was to explore the link between
the thyroid function in patients with CSU and AT by
checking the thyroid function and autoimmune processes of thyroid in patients suffering from CSU and to
compare it with the thyroid function in healthy subjects.

any thyroid disease. There were 22 women and 13 men
(63%/37%) at the age of 23 to 67 (mean: 38, median: 33,
range: 16-80). Patients with autoimmune diseases and
neoplastic diseases were excluded from the study.

The concentration of thyrotropin (TSH) (normal:
0.27-4.20 lUm/l), free thyroxine (fT4) (normal: 11.5-21.0
pmol/l), free triiodothyronine (fT3) (normal: 3.90-6.70
pmol/l), anti-thyroperoxydase antibodies (anti-TPO) and
anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (anti-Tg) was measured.
The presence of anti-TPO in concentration greater than
34 |U/ml and anti-Tg levels in titers greater than 115 |U/
ml were considered elevated. The concentration of antiTg was measured by conducting radioimmunological
tests from BRAHMS Diagnostic GMBH. Levels of antiTPO immunoglobulins was measured by RIA tests from
BRAHMS Diagnostic GMBH. Electro-chemiluminescence
immunoassay was used to check the concentration of
TSH using a set from Roche Diagnostics Switzerland. The
same assay was used to measure levels of free T3 and T4
in serum with sets from Roche Diagnostics Switzerland.

The study was approved by a local ethical committee (ethical approval number KB: 644/09) and patients
signed informed written consent.

nificant. The statistical tests were carried out with the
software Statistica 12 from StatSoft.

Results

Anti-TPO, anti-Tg, f14, fT3 and TSH concentration was
measured. Median values were 9.0 IU/ml, 16.0 |U/ml,
15.1 pmol/l, 4.8 pmol/l and 1.7 wU/ml, respectively, in
patients with CU and 8.0 IU/ml, 12.0 IU/ml, 14.9 pmol/|,
4.5 pmol/l and 1.4 U/ml, respectively, in the control
group. There is a statistically significant difference between groups as to the concentration of fT3 (p = 0.03)
(Figure 1) and anti-Tg (p = 0.003) (Figure 2). There was no
statistical difference between the concentration of antiTPO, TSH and fT4.

In the group of patients with CU, 23 of them had
elevated anti-TPO, 19 — anti-Tg, 9 had elevated both
anti-TPO and anti-Tg, 9 had an elevated concentration
of TSH, 5 had a decreased concentration of f14 and
12 — decreased fT3. Thirty-three patients were diagnosed
with AT, 24 of them were euthyroid, 5 were subclinical
hypothyroid and 4 had hypothyroidism.

There was a Statistically significant difference between groups as to the number of patients with elevated
anti-TPO (p = 0.004) and anti-Tg (p = 0.02), but there was
no statistically significant difference as to the number

 

 

 

of patients with an elevated concentration f14, fT3 and
TSH (Figure 3).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The study showed that in a group of patients with
anti-TPO > 100, there was a significantly higher percentage of patients with anti-Tg > 100. Moreover, there was
a statistically significant difference in frequency of antiTg > 100 IU/ml in the group of patients with and without
angioedema on admission (Figure 4).

Patients with CU Control group

Figure 6. Comparison of frequency of elevated anti-Tg in 4 studies [11-13]

 

Comparing 4 investigations, it was observed that CU
is connected with an increased concentration of anti-TPO
and anti-Tg (which are markers of TA). It was noticed that
there is a difference between groups as to concentration
of thyroid hormones [12-14].

A comparison of the described examination with
3 other studies, which investigated coexistence of CU
and AT, was made. There was a significantly higher likelihood of elevated levels of anti-TPO (OR = 6.65) (Figure 5)
and anti-Tg (OR = 4.89) in patients with CU than in the
control group (Figure 6). Nevertheless, there was no comparison of anti-TPO and anti-Tg levels, only a comparison of the number of patients with abnormal anti-TPO
or anti-Tg levels relative to a normal anti-TPO or anti-Tg
concentration, specific for each test and laboratory was
conducted.

 

Discussion

An association between CSU and AT has been observed since 1983, when the patient with urticaria and
thyroiditis was described by Midelfart et al. [15]. At the
same time, Leznoff et al. [16] detected elevated thyroid
microsomal antibodies (TMA) in 12.1% of CU patients
and in only 5.6% of individuals from the control group,
suspecting that CU may have an autoimmune basis [16].
After that survey, a study of 90 patients with CU, angioedema and TA was performed. The association between

 

570

CU and TA was significant, but treatment with levothyroxine did not have an influence on skin diseases [17].

In our study, we confirmed a significant difference
between CU patients and healthy subjects as to the fT3
and anti-TG concentration. Moreover, we observed that
patients with CU more frequently had an elevated concentration of anti-thyroid antibodies than individuals from
the control group. Our observations remain in compliance
with other authors’ results. In a study performed by Turktas et al. [14], the concentration of TMA and anti-Tg in
patients with CU and angioedema was measured. A statistically significant difference between the concentration
of TMA and anti-Tg in both groups of patients was found
[14]. Ryhal et al. [18] noticed that the concentration of
anti-TPO was significantly higher in patients with CU than
in the control group [18]. Also other numerous prospective
case-control studies revealed a significantly higher concentration of anti-thyroid antibodies in the group of patients
with CU than in the control group [19-21].

On the other hand, a concentration of anti-TPO, antiTg and anti-TSH-receptor antibodies was assayed by Zauli et al. [22] in patients suffering from CU with a known
cause and in CSU — the difference was not statistically
significant. In the study it was shown that TA is connected with urticaria regardless of pathogenesis.

Recent literature data suggest that CU may be associated with other thyroid gland pathologies. Four cases
of urticaria in thyroid carcinoma have been described.

Moreover, urticaria resolved after removal of tumors [23].
There were also two cases of Graves’ disease and CU.
Those patients did not respond to antihistamine drugs,
but symptoms of urticaria disappeared after corresponding treatment with anti-thyroid drugs [24].

Although the connection between CU and AT is unclear, it is known that linking of thyroid autoantibodies
to receptors of IgE on mastocytes may cause a histamine
secretion [25]. In a study conducted in 2001 by Kandeel
et al. [26], it was revealed that only patients with CSU
and AT had perivascular fibrin deposits in skin biopsies
and anti-FceR| antibodies in serum, which can lead to
secretion of histamine from mastocytes. There were no
differences in expression of selected CD and in oligoclonal T-lymphocyte subpopulation [26]. It is not proven that
anti-thyroid antibodies are the cause of CU, these are
rather co-morbid phenomena [7]. In another study it was
shown that only 10% of patients with CU and IgG antithyroid antibodies have IgE anti-thyroid antibodies, what
proves that those autoantibodies cannot be a cause of
CU [27].

Another interesting issue is the possibility to induce
remission of CU as a consequence of thyroid gland pathology treatment. Gaig et al. [28] suggest that treating autoimmune thyroid diseases with levothyroxine or methimazole can improve the results of autologous serum skin
tests (ASST) and overall condition of the patient. However,
other authors suggest that results of ASST may not stay in
compliance with TA [29], and there is no statistically significant difference in frequency of AT in patients with positive
and negative ASST [30]. If it comes to clinical implications,
umbyrt et al. [31] found that treatment using levothyroxine of euthyroid patients with anti-thyroid antibodies and
CU leads to resolution of skin lesions. Moreover, after the
treatment was stopped, urticaria returned and after introducing the treatment once again the symptoms resolved
31). In another study it was revealed that most patients
suffering from CU and TA are euthyroid and achieved the
est remissions during levothyroxine supplementation,
jowever patients with clinical or subclinical thyroid disorders have to take treatment corresponding to their disease
32]. In another study it was suggested that levothyroxine
can be an important part of treatment for patients with CU
and TA. The results of the treatment with ketotifen and levothyroxine were compared. Ketotifen treatment provided
significant relief of symptoms, but these beneficial effects
were observed only during ongoing treatment and urticaria reappeared in all patients during the drug-free follow-up
period. On the other hand, 18 of 30 patients completely
improved and 3 patients partially improved with levothyroxine treatment [33]. Although the above-described issue
was not the aim of our paper, it would be interesting to
conduct an observation on the influence of levothyroxine
on the activity of urticaria in patients presenting TA.

The connection between CU and TA is unquestioned
and there are many implications in treatment of those

diseases. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis and molecular
basis of connection is still unknown. It is very important
to find an explanation of those processes because they
may have an influence on therapy of patients with CU
and AT.
