The role of food additives in chronic urticaria (CU) is still under investigation. In this study, we aimed to explore the association
between food additives and CU by using the basophil activation test (BAT). The BAT using 15 common food additives was performed for 15 patients with CU who had a history of recurrent urticarial aggravation following intake of various foods without a
definite food-specific IgE. Of the 15 patients studied, two (13.3%) showed positive BAT results for one of the tested food additives. One patient responded to monosodium glutamate, showing 18.7% of CD203c-positive basophils. Another patient showed
a positive BAT result to sodium benzoate. Both patients had clinical correlations with the agents, which were partly determined
by elimination diets. The present study suggested that at least a small proportion of patients with CU had symptoms associated
with food additives. The results may suggest the potential utility of the BAT to identity the role of food additives in CU.

Introduction

Chronic urticaria (CU) is defined as the urticaria persisting
for more than 6 weeks. However, the etiology is frequently
deemed as unclear, as most classical investigations failed to
find the causes [1]. Although approximately one-half of CU
cases have been shown to have an autoimmune etiology, the

remaining cases have no known etiology or culprit agent de
spite thorough evaluation [1]. The literature shows that 30%
of patients believe that food might be a cause of their CU
because variations in the diet, especially those that contain
high levels of spices, seasonings, or natural histamine-like sub
 

stances aggravated their symptoms [2,3]. However, clinically
relevant allergies to foods are thought to be rare (occurring in
less than 10% of cases) in patients with CU [4].

Food additives are substances used as sweeteners, flavor

ings, coloring agents, antioxidants or preservatives [5]. There
are thousands of substances [6], while relatively few have been
implicated in the significant adverse reactions [7]. Of these,
artrazine, benzoate, monosodium glutamate (MSG), sulfite,
aspartame, nitrites, salicylate and some colorants have been
ipped as the potential culprits for adverse food reactions [5].
heir potential roles in CU pathogenesis have been suggested
by a few studies [8-13], but they are still under investigation.
he reasons for the lack of evidence could be attributed to
he practical difficulty of performing the gold standard test,
he double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC)
14,15]. In addition, the methodological issues such as incon
 

sistent inclusion criteria and the absence of a standardized
challenge protocol exist, and the outcome of the DBPCFC is
not always satisfactory [11,16,17]. The skin prick test, which
is widely used to screen sensitized allergens, is not useful for

 

 

discriminating food additives hypersensitivity [13]. Assuming
the culprit additive depends solely on the patient's subjective symptoms, which are sometimes vague and provoked by
unrelated foods. Therefore, the selection of potential culprits

can detect not only IgE-mediated responses [18-20] but also
non-IgE-mediated immediate hypersensitivity [21-26], which

 

means that it can be applied to allergic diseases of which the

 

mechanism is not clearly known. Moreover, the BAT is not time
consuming and able to examine multiple antigens at the same
time.

 

In this regards, we assumed that the BAT may be useful for
diagnosing food additives hypersensitivity in patients with CU.
The present study aimed to explore the association between
food additives and CU by the utilization of BAT.

Materials and Methods
Study Population

From October 2011 through March 2013, a total of 15 CU patients (duration >6 weeks) from the division of allergy and clinical immunology of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital
(SNUBH) were prospectively and consecutively enrolled in this
study. They were included if they reported recurrent aggravations of urticaria by various kinds of food from history including food diary but did not have clear evidence of food-specific

specialists. All patients voluntarily participated in this study, and
rovided written informed consent. This study was approved by
the institutional review board of SNUBH.

 

 

Sample Analysis

The BAT was carried out using a commercially available
Flow-CAST® kit (Biihlmann, Schénenbuch, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instruction. A total of 15 food
additives, which had been previously reported to cause hypersensitivity reactions, were tested using commercial allergens
of the CAST®"«s¢"5 (Biihlmann, Schénenbuch, Switzerland),
which included MSG, sodium nitrite, tartrazine, sodium saicylate, potassium metabisulfite, sodium benzoate, and food
colorant mix| (quinolone yellow, sunset yellow FCF, chromorope FB, amaranth and new coccine), and food colorant mix
\l(erythrosine, patent blue V, indigo carmine, and brilliant black
BN) [28].
Briefly, BAT was performed using the following steps. The
patients’ blood was processed within 2 hours after sampling in
EDTA tubes. After removing the erythrocytes, the sample was

 

reated with stimulation buffer solution. The cell suspensions
were divided into 11 tubes containing two positive controls,
one negative control, and the 15 kinds of food additives described above, respectively. Regarding the positive controls,
monoclonal antibodies to high affinity IgE receptors and nonspecific N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) were
used. The stimulation buffer was added to the tubes for back
 

 

ground and negative control. The results of the BAT were expressed as percentages of basophils expressing CD203c which
was known to be increasingly expressed on the basophil surface after allergenic stimulation in sensitized individuals and
was regarded as a basophil activation marker. The expression
of CD203c was detected with anti-CD203c-phycoerythrin. The
stimulation index (SI) was calculated as follows:

Stimulation index (SI) = percentage of basophils activated
by the food additive / percentage of activated basophils in the
negative control.

The BAT was determined to be positive if the basophil ac

manufacturer's instructions.

Results
Characteristics of Study Subjects

A total of 15 patients with CU were enrolled in this study
(Table 1). They had a mean age of 38.7 + 13.2 years, and
80.0% of them were women. The mean duration of symptoms
was 33.0 + 17.7 months. Only one patients (6.3%) showed
elevated peripheral eosinophil counts and 7 patients (46.6%)
had elevated total IgE levels >250 IU/mL. None had anti-thyroid hormone antibodies. Five patients (33.3%) were positive
in skin testing or UniCAP to the food allergens, but all of them
did not show any clinical correlations with urticaria.

The results of the BAT, skin test and specific IgE test in
each patient are summarized in Table 2. Two patients (13.3%)
showed positive BAT to any of food additives. The detailed
histories of these cases are described as follows.

 

 

 

Patient 1.

A 37-year-old woman visited the outpatient allergy clinic
because of urticaria. She suffered from recurrent generalized
urticaria, rash, and facial angioedema. She complained that
the urticarial aggravation occurred particularly when eating
high-seasoned, spicy, or Chinese foods. Previously, she had

been treated for allergic rhinitis and also had experienced
severe urticaria with a generalized rash after taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Peripheral eosinophil
counts and serum total IgE in her blood were 97.2/yL and 97
U/L, respectively. T4 and thyroid stimulating hormone were
also within normal range. A skin prick test showed weakly
ositive reactions (wheal size 3 mm but allergen/histamine
ratio <1) to silk worm pupa, herring, cabbage, celery and walnut; however, none of them provoked urticaria in the history.
n the BAT, a total of 18.7% of basophils were activated after
stimulation with MSG (Figure 1); however, the other 14 addiives did not induce significant basophil activation, compare
‘0 the negative control (1.30%).

 

Patient 2.

A 19 year-old female high school student with recurren
urticaria visited the allergy clinic. She complained of recurren
episodes of localized urticaria and erythematous rashes on
face. She had been experiencing urticarial symptoms that ha
developed after eating a school meal. Her past medical history or family history was unremarkable for allergic diseases.
Laboratory findings including peripheral eosinophil count an
serum total IgE were within the normal range. The result of an
autologous serum skin test was also negative. There were no
food allergens which positively reacted to the skin prick test.
In BAT, only sodium benzoate activated basophils significantly

Discussion

The present study explored the proportion of patient with
‘ood additives hypersensitivity in 15 patients with CU via the
utilization of the BAT. All of them had recurrent urticaria aggravated by various food intakes, which did not have evident
‘ood-specific IgE against common food allergens. A total of
3.3% of participants showed a positive BAT to any of the
ested 15 common food additives, which may suggest a poential clinical utility of the BAT in such cases.

CU can be provoked by specific physical factors, such as
pressure, heat, cold, sunlight and even non-specific stimuli [1].
However, for most of the patients with CU, it did not have a
well-described cause. Recent advances in the pathogenesis
of CU revealed that 45% of patients presented autoimmune
markers such as anti-FeeRl-a@, anti-IgE or thyroid autoanti

bodies, and an autologous serum skin test was positive in 4.176.5% of cases [29]. However, the etiology of the remaining
55% of patients is still unknown and remained ‘idiopathic’.

Many patients regard that urticaria are attributed to foo
allergies because their symptoms seem to fluctuate according
to their diet. There are several reports that 22.5-30.0% of patients regard food as the cause of CU [2,3]. However, contrary
to these beliefs, it seems that only less than 10% of CU migh'
be associated with IgE mediated food allergies [30]. Kobra an
his colleagues examined the results of DBPCFC and only 10%
of patients who complained about food-provoked aggravation
of urticaria, reproduced their symptoms [4,31].

The clinical features of CU that can be associated with die
could be somewhat different from those of food allergies.
Food allergy is mediated by an IgE-dependent allergic mechanism and is more likely to result in acute urticaria as a generalized allergic reaction. Food allergy also develops in response to
only certain foods and/or some foods or vegetables that share
antigenic similarity [32]. However, in CU, similar cutaneous
reactions could be developed by several apparently unrelated
foods and is especially more common as a reaction to com

About 3,968 substances are registered in Everything Added

also had limitations due to the fact that the criteria for patient
selection and study design were not consistent.

he DBPCFC is the gold standard to diagnose hypersensitivity to foods or food additives [32]. However, it is difficult to
execute this on patients with CU in actual clinical practice.
Patients with CU are usually taking an antihistamine, which

allenge test. However this may cause an increase in the
activity of CU, and thus cause a false positive reaction to the
provocation. On the contrary, if the antihistamine is not sufficiently stopped, a false negative result can occur even though
food additives are the cause of CU. It is also difficult to con

duct the test in a placebo-controlled manner due to the fact
that food additives have their own taste and smell. Additionally, in many cases, it is difficult to select candidate additives
solely based on the patients’ symptoms and food diaries.
A pseudoallergen-free diet can be an alternative option to
determine the possibility of hypersensitivity to food additives
as a cause of CU. Previous studies reported that a pseudoallergen-free diet could be effective to reduce the severity of
CU [10,16,38-40]. Magerl et al. [40] tested a pseudoallergenfree diet on 140 CU patients, and 34% showed significant
improvement on urticarial severity and/or quality of life [40].
However, a pseudoallergen-free diet restricts all preserved and
processed food, and even all spices and herbs, eggs, cakes,
biscuits, tomatoes, fresh and dried fruits, except for salt and
chives. Therefore, it is hard to carry out in real life and might
cause nutritional imbalances [38].
There are many attempts to develop in vitro methods to diagnose the cause of CU. Recently, basophils are gaining much
attention due to their important roles in CU [41-44]. Basophils
play an important role in traditional IgE-mediated food allergies [45]. Due to the biological response in which activated basophils plays an important role in causing an allergic reaction,
it would be more suitable to measure basophil responsiveness
after antigenic stimulation rather than to measure the level of
specific IgE in order to evaluate the clinical reactivity of CU.
he BAT measures the level of expression of CD63 or CD203¢
n basophil surfaces with flow cytometry after stimulation of
blood cells with allergen [19,20,46]. CD63 or CD203e, which is
sed as a basophil activation marker, exists within the secre‘ory vesicles inside the basophil at resting stage, and when
he basophil is activated causing secretion of the vesicles, the
D63 or CD203c moves to the surface of cell membrane. The
evel of degranulation of mediators as a result of basophil acivation is known to be directly proportional with the expression CD63 and/or CD203c [47-49].
There are numerous reports on the usefulness of the BAT in
various allergic diseases. It proved to be especially useful in diagnosing bee or wasp venom anaphylaxis [50]. The BAT could
be used to test the induction of tolerance in children with
cow's milk allergy [51]. The BAT is also effective in diagnosing
food allergies such as IgE-mediated reactions against pollenderived food [19,20] or wheat [46]. It is also useful to test nonallergic or pseudoallergic reactions including drugs [26] such
as muscle relaxants [22], antibiotics [23], NSAIDs [24], and even
radiocontrast media [21].
However, the BAT for food additives has not been sufficient

y studied yet. Garcia-Ortega and his colleagues confirme
using the BAT that hypersensitivity to sodium metabisulfite
induced CU [52]. Ebo et al. reported the case of a patient who
had a history of recurrent anaphylaxis after eating cheese, an
ound that hypersensitivity to the natural dye annatto (Ceska
Annato WS E160b), which was positive on the BAT, was the
cause of anaphylaxis [53]. In our study, the BAT was performe
on CU patients whose symptoms were suspected to be reated to hypersensitivity to food additives. The culprit was no’
clearly identified through their history, food diaries, skin prick
ests for common food allergens or other additional laboraory tests. Of these patients, one patient showed a positive
BAT to MSG and another to sodium benzoate. In these two
atients, no symptom developed when they ate at home, but
he conditions deteriorated when they ate outside the home,
especially for Chinese foods or soups with plenty of seasonings and spices.

The present study has several limitations. First, we did not
perform the DBPCFC for the two positive cases as the patients
did not agree to perform the oral provocation tests with each
additive. Instead, we instructed them on how to restrict the
specific additives in their daily diet. Eventually, their symptoms
improved after starting a specific food additive-free diet. Second, our low percentage of participants with the positive food
additives BAT (13.3%) could raise questions on its diagnostic
utility. Several factors are presumed to be responsible. We
tested only 15 kinds of common food additives, which could
be insufficient for screening purposes. Another possibility
could be due to false negative results of the BAT, as shown in
our previous study for taurine [54]. In addition, less stringent
inclusion criteria could have influenced the positivity of BAT,
and have limited our interpretation on the diagnostic utility. We suppose that the positivity might be increased if the
subjects were more specifically selected for food additives
reactions with oral provocation tests. Nevertheless, our two
positive cases were clinically meaningful, as they could have
remained unresolved without the diagnostic investigations.
hird, we only performed the BAT for 15 patients with CU. This
small sample size limits the interpretation of our results. Due
‘0 the quite low prevalence of food additives hypersensitivity and it's as-yet undetermined role, a large-scale study is
needed to further evaluate the potential utility of BAT with
ood additives.
Despite the issues surrounding the use of the BAT for food
additives, it could be a good alternative to the oral provocaion test as a means to evaluate hypersensitivity to food ad

ditives in patients with CU. First, it can be applied not only in
IgE-mediated, but also in non-IgE mediated reactions, which
means that it can be applied to allergic diseases for which the

un

derlying mechanism is not clearly. In addition, BAT results

are not affected by anti-histamine or steroid use. Therefore it
can prevent the exacerbation of urticaria stemming from the
discontinuance of such drugs as well as false negative results
for oral provocation tests due to insufficient discontinuation

drugs. The BAT can be used to evaluate multiple candidate
