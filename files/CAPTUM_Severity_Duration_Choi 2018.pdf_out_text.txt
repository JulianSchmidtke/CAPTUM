Background/Aims: Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common skin disorder characterized by wheals and pruritus lasting more than 6 weeks. Due to its long duration and changeable symptoms, the quality of life (QOL) of patients with CU
can be impaired substantially. We evaluated the CU-QOL, a previously validated
CU-specific QOL measure, and investigated factors influencing QOL in chronic
spontaneous urticaria (CSU) patients.

Methods: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was performed on 390 adult
patients diagnosed with CSU from March 2009 to December 2012 at the Allergy and Clinical Immunology Clinic at Ajou University Hospital. The CU-QOL
questionnaire, urticaria activity score (UAS), combined angioedema, and serum
total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels were investigated.

Results: The average CU-QOL score obtained from the questionnaire was 70.6
(of 100 points). The CU-QOL scores correlated significantly with the UAS, particularly with the 15-point UAS (UAS-15; coefficient —0.532, p < 0.01) rather than
the 6-point UAS (0.502, p < 0.01). The patients presenting with angioedema and
urticaria had poorer scores in the urticaria symptom domain than those with urticaria alone (37.4 vs. 46.9, p = 0.004). Log-transformed serum total IgE levels correlated significantly with CU-QOL (-0.131, p < 0.05). Multivariate regression models indicated that severe CU (UAS-15 score = 13), log (total IgE), and the presence of
angioedema were significant predictors of impaired CU-QOL (< 85 points).
Conclusions: CU has a substantial negative impact on QOL. The assessment of
UAS-15, total IgE, and the presence of angioedema can be useful to predict QOL
of the patients with CSU.

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common skin disorder, defined by recurrent wheals and pruritus, with or without
angioedema for at least 6 weeks [1]. CU accounts for 25%
of urticaria, and the prevalence of CU is 0.1% to 0.6% [2].
In acute urticaria (AU) possible eliciting factors, such as
drug or food, are often identified by detailed patient his

responses to symptomatic treatment. However, about
80% patients with CU, the underlying cause is not identified and its pathogenesis is not clearly established [1,3].
These patients whose urticaria occurs without obvious
extrinsic stimuli are diagnosed with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU).

Urticaria is a mast cell-driven disease and histamine
is considered to be the key mediator. Degranulation of
skin mast cells by heterogeneous activating signals results in sensory nerve activation, vasodilation, plasma
extravasation, and cell recruitment to urticarial lesions
B]. Many studies have shown that about 50% of CU is
related to autoimmunity [2,3]. Elevated histamine releasability from skin mast cells and skin infiltration of
blood basophils have also been noted in the pathogenesis of CU [3].

Health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) in CU can be
impaired substantially due to its unpredictable symp
 

toms and long-term nature. In a previous study, the
impairment of QOL in CU was comparable with that of
patients with coronary artery disease awaiting coronary
artery bypass grafting [4]. Additionally, recent studies
have shown psychological stress and emotional disturbances to be common in patients with CU [5-7]. Ozkan et
al. [8] showed that 60% of CU patients had a psychiatric
diagnosis and their QOL was reduced.

In most cases, the evaluation of CU has focused on
clinical symptoms; however, understanding and dealing
with QOL in CU patients is also necessary to improve
patient management, address economic costs, and further clinical research. Recent guidelines recommended
the use of the urticaria activity score (UAS) as a tool for
assessing urticaria disease activity, and the CU-QOL
questionnaire [9], which was the first measurement device developed in Italy to assess disease-specific QOL in
patients with CU [2]. However, HR-QOL generally depends on the disease entity and social environment in
which patients live. We developed a CU-specific QOL
(CU-QOL) questionnaire as a validated tool, which considers Korean culture and language [10].

This study was aimed at evaluating QOL impairment
in CSU patients using our own CU-QOL questionnaire
and the correlation between UAS and CU-QOL. Additionally, we sought to investigate possible predictors of
impaired CU-QOL.

METHODS
Subjects

We enrolled 390 adult patients with CSU who were followed in the Allergy and Clinical Immunology Clinic at

186 www.kjim.org

The Korean Journal of Internal Medicine Vol. 33, No. 1, January 2018

Ajou University Hospital from March 2009 to December 2012. Inclusion criteria were age = 20 years old and
suffering from urticaria symptoms (USs), such as wheals
and itching, for more than 6 weeks. Patients with urticarial vasculitis, physically inducible urticaria, or other
chronic skin diseases were excluded.

Assessment of the QOL (CU-QOL) and UAS

The QOL was assessed with the CU-QOL questionnaire
(range, © to 100), which has been shown to be a reliable
and valid instrument. It consists of 17 items in four categories: US, emotional distress (ED), stigma, and food/
environmental distress (FE) [10].

CU disease activity was assessed using the total UAS
(UAS-15), which was measured using a combination of
four characteristics of wheals: numbers (UAS-1: 0, no
wheals; 1, < 20 wheals; 2, 21 to 50 wheals; 3, > 50 wheals),
distribution range (UAS-2: 0, none; 1, < 25% of the body
surface area [BSA]; 2, 25% to 50% of the BSA; 3, > 50% of
the BSA), mean diameter (UAS-3: 0, no wheals; 1, < 1 cm;
2, 1 to 3 cm; 3, >3 cm), and duration (UAS-4: o, no wheals;
1, < 4 hours; 2, 4 to 12 hours; 3, > 12 hours), and pruritus
according to intensity (UAS-5: 0, no pruritus; 1, mild; 2,
moderate; 3, severe) within the last week for outpatient
clinic visits, yielding a total score of 0 to 15 [10,11]. We
also used the 6-point UAS (UAS-6), which is the sum of
wheal numbers (UAS-1) and pruritus intensity (UAS-s)
[2]. The presence of angioedema was also checked.

Measurement of total immunoglobulin E

Serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) level was measured
using the ImmunoCAP system (Pharmacia Diagnostics,
Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Statistical analyses

Data for continuous variable are shown as mean + SD
or median values (minimum to maximum). Spearman’s
tho was used for the correlation of the CU-QOL and
UAS items. A multivariate analysis was used for linear
regression to determine predictors that influenced CUQOL. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the effects
of various factors on CU-QOL. p values < 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS version 12
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

RESULTS

Clinical characteristics of the study subjects and
assessment of CU-QOL and UAS

In total, 390 Korean patients with CSU were enrolled.
There were 158 men (40.5%) and 232 women (59.5%) with
a mean age of 40.8 + 10.6 years. The average CU duration was 32.6 + 52.1 months. Urticaria was accompanied
by angioedema in 120 of 308 patients (39.0%). The mean
UAS-15 was 10 (0 to 15) and UAS-6 was 4 (o to 6). Mean
log (total IgE) was 2.1 + 0.5. The median CU-QOL score
obtained from the questionnaire was 70.6 (0 to 98.5).
Patients were stratified into four quartiles based on
total CU-QOL scores (Fig. 1). Patients possessing total
CU-QOL scores below the fourth quartile (0 to 85) were
deemed to have CU-QOL impairment in this study.
There were gradual and significant decreases in both
UAS-15 and UAS-6 in the first through fourth quartiles
but, otherwise, there were no significant differences in
baseline demographic or clinical characteristics (Table
1). Additionally, significant variability was noted in the
each of the four domains, when patients were classified
by the quartile distribution of CU-QOL. The US domain
score was the lowest, at 43.7 (0 to 100) and the stigma domain score was as high as 100 (0 to 100) among the four

domains of CU-QOL (Table 1).

Correlation between CU-QOL and UAS

The total CU-QOL and each of the four category scores
correlated significantly with the UAS, both UAS-15 and
UAS-6. UAS-15 had a higher correlation (coefficient
—0.532, p < 0.01) than UAS-6 (-0.502, p < 0.01). Each category of UAS had a higher correlation with the US and ED

We classified severe and non-severe CU according to a
UAS-15 score of = 13, a determinant of uncontrolled CU
ina previous study [11]. Total CU-QOL scores decreased
significantly in patients with severe CU (52.3 vs. 72.1, p
< 0.001). Scores in each domain in CU-QOL were also
significantly lower in severe CU than in non-severe CU

patients (Fig. 2).

In comparing the CU-QOL scores according to the
presence of angioedema, the US domain was significantly decreased in patients with angioedema compared
with those with urticaria alone (37.4 vs. 46.9, p = 0.004).
In contrast, there were no significant differences in total
scores or the other three domains of CU-QOL between
patients with and without angioedema (Fig. 3). Patients
having angioedema also scored significantly higher values in both UAS-15 (10.0 + 4.1 vs. 8.9 + 4.4, p = 0.005) and
UAS-6 (4.0 + 1.8 vs. 3.6 + 1.9, p = 0.025) when compared to

were significantly correlated with total CU-QOL (coefficient —0.131, p < 0.05) and ED domain scores (-0.129, p <

noted with UAS-15 (0.123, p = 0.031), but not with UAS6 (0.019, p = 0.735). Regarding each category of UAS-15,
UAS-2 (distribution range of wheals, coefficient 0.136, p

0.211, p < 0.001) correlated significantly with log (total

IgE levels.

for gender, age, and urticaria duration (Table 3).

DISCUSSION

Recently, concerns about the deterioration of QOL of
patients with CU have been heightened. In addition to
clinical symptoms, like pruritus, wheals, and angioedema, many other factors, including the unexpectedness
of symptom occurrence, sleep disturbances, and changes in appearance, are major problems for patients with
CU. Thus, we need a more integrated approach to understand the whole influence of CU on patients. In the
same context, recent guidelines and many health authorities have recommended using CU-QOL measurements and other patient-reported outcomes, like the
urticaria control test [12], as major parameters in clinical
practice and research [2,13].

The present study demonstrated substantial impair
https://doi.org/10.3904/kjim.2015.195

ment in disease-specific QOL among patients with CSU.
When patients were stratified into four quartiles, based
on total CU-QOL scores, each of the four different dimensions also varied significantly. The US domain,
which reflects on physical symptoms, was the most impacted domain. However, significant reductions in the
ED and FE domains also suggest that CSU patients do
not suffer only from physical symptoms but also from
impairment in their emotional well-being and daily or
social activities. Thus, understanding QOL in CSU patients is important to improve patient management.

In a previous study validating the CU-QOL in Korean patients, patients with CU as well as with physically
inducible urticaria were enrolled. The main result from
that study was that UAS, dermographism, and emotional stress were important predictors of CU-QOL in
Korean CU patients [10]. The present study focused on
measuring CU-QOL and exploring predictors of QOL
impairment in patients with CSU. In addition to UAS15, the presence of angioedema and log (total IgE) were
also identified as significant predictors of impaired CUQOL.

Most studies have reported that about 30% to 50%
of CU patients have angioedema [10,14,15]. Toubi et al.
[15] reported that more patients with accompanying angioedema were still suffering from urticaria at up to 5
years of follow-up compared with patients who exhibited only wheals (45% vs. 12%). We found a significant
association between co-existing angioedema and poor
scores in the US domain of CU-QOL and both UAS15 and UAS-6. Although neither UAS-15 nor UAS-6,
nor CU-QOL, consider angioedema sufficiently, more
prominent disease activity and a significant difference
in a specific QOL domain were noted in patients having
angioedema, indicating that CU-QOL was a more reli

able measurement for Korean patients with CU. However, additional impairment in QOL in patients with
CSU presenting with angioedema was not evident in
a prior study using a different QOL measurement [16].
Thus, specific instruments to measure angioedema activity and angioedema-related QOL impairment in CU
patients with recurrent angioedema with or without
wheals have been proposed [17,18].

Omalizumab (anti-IgE) is currently recommended
for CU patients resistant to antihistamines, based on
demonstrated efficacy and safety in recent clinical trials
[19-21]. The importance of serum IgE levels in CU patients is increasingly recognized due to the clinical benefit of omalizumab, although it was effective in patients
with CU regardless of IgE levels. Kessel et al. [22] reported that total serum IgE levels are frequently elevated in
CU patients and these are significantly related to disease
severity and duration. Increasing evidence suggests that
autoreactivity including not only IgG autoantibodies
against IgE and/or FceRI but also IgE antibodies to endogenous antigens, in patients with CSU plays an important role [23]. The IgE-occupied mast cells become
more sensitive due to a decreased threshold for degran
 

ulation as well as those cells can store more mediators as
compared with mast cells without IgE engagement [23].
A significant correlation between total IgE levels and urticaria disease activity was shown in the present study.
However, log (total IgE) showed a significant correlation
with UAS-15, but not with UAS-6. Log (total IgE) was associated significantly with the distribution range and
mean diameter of wheals in CU patients, whereas we
found no significant correlation between total IgE levels
and the numbers of wheals and the intensity of pruri
 

tus. UAS-6 does not consider other factors of urticaria
disease activity, except wheal numbers and pruritus intensity. A sequential assessment of wheal numbers and
pruritus every day for a week (UAS-7) has been adopted
in recent guidelines and clinical research [2,19]. Despite
a wider range (0 to 42) of scores in UAS-7 compared with
UAS-6 (0 to 6), both UAS-7 and UAS-6 are limited in the
evaluation of wheal numbers and pruritus. However, our
results suggest that a more comprehensive assessment
of the disease activity is appropriate for understanding
the clinical characteristics of CU and for identifying major drivers of QOL impairment in CSU patients. We also

 

found that log-transformed serum total IgE levels in pa

tients with CSU correlated significantly with total CUQOL scores and the ED domain. This relationship may
be explained by the effect of IgE antibodies on the extent
of mast cell activation and degranulation [19,22]. Checking the serum total IgE levels can be useful to predict
urticaria severity and CU-QOL in patients with CSU.

Based on previous studies, the UAS, which combines
wheal numbers and pruritus intensity, correlated significantly with QOL impairment, as measured using
the Dermatology Life Quality Index in CU patients [24].
The present study showed the total CU-QOL scores and
all individual domains correlated significantly with the
UAS, and particularly well with the UAS-15, including
duration, size, and distribution of wheals, when compared with the UAS-6. Of the five categories of UAS-15,
UAS-2, which scores the distribution range of wheals,
showed the strongest correlation with CU-QOL, but it
is not included in UAS-6. Although the assessment of
UAS-15 requires more time than UAS-6, UAS-15 is a
more detailed and enhanced tool, and our results support that it is more suitable for the evaluation of impairment of CU-QOL.

We defined ‘severe’ CU as a UAS-15 score of 13 or more,
as used previously [11]. A multivariate logistic regression
demonstrated that severe CU was a significant and independent predictor of impaired CU-QOL, and it also correlated significantly with each domain factor. Regarding
more severe CU leading to more frequently uncontrolled CU [11] and to a higher socio-economic burden
[25], careful consideration of how serious QOL impairment is caused by CU is needed, particularly in patients
with severe CU. We attempted to identify predictors of
impaired CU-QOL in CSU patients. There have been
many studies investigating QOL impairment in patients
with CSU, but clinical interpretation according to QOL
score is rare. A multivariate analysis showed that severe
CU, log (total IgE), and the presence of angioedema are
significant predictors of impaired CU-QOL in Korean
adults with CU.

In conclusion, physicians need to pay more attention
to CU-QOL impairment in CSU patients for a better
understanding of the disease burden in individual patients. Additionally, the assessment of patients in more
comprehensive ways, including UAS-15, total IgE, and
the presence of angioedema, to identify major determinants of CU-QOL is necessary.
