Abstract

Objectives: To examine the evidence derived from randomized controlled clinical trials on the efficacy and safety
of omalizumab compared to placebo in controlling symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria/chronic spontaneous
urticaria (CIU/CSU).

Data source: The electronic databases PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Biomed Central, The Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Wiley, OVID, and HighwirePress were reviewed. The date limit was set to May 31th, but it was
extended to September 30th of 2014 due to a new publication. No language restriction was used. The articles included
were randomized trials controlled with placebo in individuals older than 12 years diagnosed with CIU/CSU refractory to
conventional treatment, the intervention being, omalizumab at different doses, and the comparison, placebo. The
primary outcome was symptom improvement according to the weekly score of urticaria severity (UAS7), the itch
severity score (ISS), the weekly score of number of urticarial lesions, the dermatology life quality index, and the chronic
urticaria quality of life questionnaire (CU-QoL). Databases were searched using the following Mesh or EMTREE key
words including as intervention omalizumab or humanized monoclonal antibody, compared to placebo and the
disease of interest urticaria or angioedema . The title, abstract and article were reviewed by two independent
investigators, according to the selection criteria in each of the databases. An assessment of the quality of the articles
was performed according to the bias tool from the studies of the Cochrane Collaboration. Information such as author
data, date of study, number of participants, interventions, dose and frequency of administration, comparison, time
of follow-up, measurements of weekly score of urticaria activity, pruritus severity score, weekly urticarial lesions,
percentage of angioedema and post-treatment change were extracted. Frequency of adverse events and the
ones suspected to be caused by the intervention drug were included.

Results: 770 records were identified in all databases described. 720 were eliminated for failing to meet the inclusion
criteria in the first review or for duplicate records. 24 articles were reviewed by abstract, 18 additional articles were
further removed, leaving 6 records for inclusion. An experimental study was excluded because it wasn t randomized.
Five studies were finally included, with 1117 patients, of these 831 received a dose of omalizumab of 75 mg (183
patients, 16.38%), 150 mg (163 patients, 14.59%), 300 mg (437 patients, 39.12%) or 600 mg (21 patients, 1.8%), as a
single dose, or every 4 weeks until 24 weeks maximum. The average age was 42.07 years, predominantly female gender
and white ethnicity. It was observed that the use of omalizumab 300 mg lowered the weekly scores of urticarial activity
in 19.9 vs. 6.9 on placebo (p <0.01), 19 vs 8.5 and 20.7 vs 8.01 in three studies, the weekly ISS (—9.2 vs. - 3.5, p <0.001,
—98 vs —5.1 p< 0.01, -8.6 vs —4.0 and —9.4 vs —3.63 p <0.001 in four studies), and the percentage of angioedema-free
days (omalizumab 95.5% vs. placebo 89.2% p <0.001, and 91.95% vs. 88.1% p <0.001 in two of the studies respectively).

 

Limitations: The different doses used throughout the study, time of administration and follow-up periods ranged from
single dose to monthly dose for 24 weeks. Therefore no meta-analysis of the review was conducted.

Conclusions and implications of the main findings: Despite the limitations, it is considered that omalizumab
300 mg is effective in treating chronic idiopathic urticaria refractory to H1 antihistamines. Further studies are required

to determine the duration of effective treatment.

Introduction

Chronic idiopathic urticaria/chronic spontaneous urticaria
(CIU/CSU), is a skin disease characterized by recurrent
appearance of wheals, angioedema, or both, occurring at
least twice a week for more than 6 weeks [1]. Its course is
self-limiting with spontaneous remissions and relapses [2].
It is an important cause of morbidity and even though it
has a very low risk of endangering life, it has a high impact
on quality of life [3,4]. This disease affects at least 0.5-1.0%
of the population and 40% may present urticarial lesions
up to 10 years later [1,4-7].

The pathogenesis of CIU/CSU is not completely
understood. It is considered that mast cell degranulation and histamine release play a major role, however,
in more than half of the patients there is no established
triggering allergic event that can be made responsible
for the mast cell activation and so it is called chronic
idiopathic (or spontaneous) urticaria [3,4]. In some cases
the presence of immunoglobulin G antibodies to the high
affinity receptor for IgE (FceRI) alpha subunit or to IgE
itself has been documented [2,4].

Treatment options are few and usually off-label [3].
The EAACI/GA*LEN/EDE/WAO (European Academy
of Allergology and Clinical Immunology, Global Allergy
and Asthma European Network, European Dermatology
Forum and World Allergy Organization, respectively)
guidelines recommend the use of non-sedating antihistamines at conventional dose as a first line of treatment,
the increase of their dosage up to fourfold as a second
line, and the use of Omalizumab, montelukast, or systemic
immunosuppressants as cyclosporine A for the third line
of treatment, and corticosteroids for a short course for
disease exacerbations [8].

For those patients refractory to standard medical
management, the use of omalizumab, an IgG1k type
monoclonal antibody that binds to free Immunoglobulin
E in the blood, has been proposed as a treatment [3]. It
also reduces the expression of Fc epsilon RI in circulating
basophils [9]. The mechanisms by which it reduces the activity of urticaria are not precisely known, but it has been
reported to diminish the expression and activation of mast
cells of the skin, and the subsequent release of histamine
and other mediators such as leukotrienes, tryptase, chymase,
prostaglandin D2 and cytokines [9,10].

Omalizumab is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe persistent asthma inadequately controlled
with inhaled steroids and positive in vivo or in vitro tests
for perennial aero-allergens and achieving improvement
of up to 75% compared to baseline, and now is approved
for patients with CIU/CSU [8 ]. Its main adverse effect is
anaphylaxis, with a mean frequency of 0,14% in asthmatic
patients that receive the drug [11]; however, side effects
reported in patients with CIU/CSU occured in 1-10% and
included local reactions at the injection site (swelling,
redness and itching), sinusitis, headache, arthralgia, and
upper respiratory infections, with lack of serious and
severe adverse events probably due to the lower doses
used for this indication [9,12]. In some cases there has
been a reaction similar to serum sickness. Injection is recommended to be applied at the hospital and followed by
an observation period of two hours after the first dose and
30 minutes after subsequent injections.

The effect of omalizumab in CIU/CSU has been measured using the Urticaria Activity Score (UAS), which
assesses the number of urticarial lesions and intensity of
itching that occurs in one or 7 days, or the Dermatology
Life Quality Index (DLQI) which measures the impact of
skin diseases on quality of life, among others [10]. Given
the above, we decided to conduct a systematic review of
the literature where the efficacy of omalizumab is evaluated
and compared to placebo, in patients older than 12 years
with CIU/CSU in terms of symptom improvement.

Methods

A systematic literature review was conducted to identify
all studies evaluating the efficacy of omalizumab in the
treatment of CIU/CSU. The study population included
individuals older than 12 years diagnosed with CIU/CSU
who had failed to treatment with H1 antihistamines. The
intervention was the use of omalizumab at different
doses (75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, 600 mg) subcutaneously
every 4 weeks, and the comparison was to placebo. The
main outcome measures were symptom control established by: 1) weekly score of urticarial activity (Urticaria
Activity Score -UAS- 7), this being the sum of the individual scores of daily urticaria activity (UAS) in the last 7 days,
it can vary from 0 42 points per week (0 6 days); 2) the
weekly Itch Severity Score (Itch Severity Score-ISS-)
Carrillo et al. World Allergy Organization Journal (2014)7:72

consisting of average daily sum (morning and evening) of
pruritus scores in the last 7 days, with 0 being no pruritus,
1 mild, 2 moderate, 3 Severe, with a value from 0 to 21; 3)
weekly number of wheals measured twice daily (morning
and evening) on a scale of 0 when there was no urticaria
to 3 when there were over 12 urticaria lesions (0: none, 1:
1 6,2:7 12 3:> 12 lesions) with a weekly value from 0 to
21; 4) largest wheal size (0: none, 1: <1.25 cm, 2:
1.25 cm-2.5 cm, 3:> 2.5 cm) twice daily for a week; 5) The
Dermatology Life Quality Index, which is a life quality
scale that includes 10 items on 6 topics: symptoms and
feelings, daily activities, leisure, work/school, personal
relationships and treatment. Each item is scored on a
4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3. The overall score of
DLQI ranges from 0 30 by adding each of the scores
of each item. A high score indicates a big change in
quality of life; 6) the chronic urticaria quality of life questionnaire (Chronic Urticaria Quality of LifeQuestionnaireCu-Q2oL-) which includes physical, emotional, social and
practical domains that characterize this disease; and 7)
presence of angioedema in proportion [13-15]. Safety
events were also included such as 8) frequency of adverse
events; 9) serious adverse events; and 10) adverse events
suspected to be caused by the study drug.

Double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical
trials (RCTs) were selected. A placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was defined as a prospective study that
included individuals randomly assigned to one or more
alternatives including placebo.

A comprehensive and reproducible search for original
work was performed in electronic databases related to
health PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Trip Database, Wiley,
Biomed Central, Highwire Press, EBSCO and OVID
using MeSH terms, EMTREE terms or keywords that
included Omalizumab or Antibodies, Monoclonal,
Humanized or placebo and urticaria or angioedema .
For the PubMed database we used ( Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized [Majr]) OR Placebos [Mesh]) AND
( Urticaria [Mesh] OR Angioedema [Mesh]) [16]. This
data search was conducted without language filter and
with a date limit to May 31th of 2014, but it was extended
to September 30th of 2014 due to a new publication this
month. The search was restricted to humans, placebocontrolled RCT. The placebo-controlled RCTs that evaluated the effect of omalizumab on controlling symptoms in
patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria were eligible.
Other sources of information such as conferences, conference proceedings, posters, newspapers and secondary
sources such as systematic reviews, and gray literature
were not included. A review by title was performed in the
described databases and in those who generated uncertainty, the abstract or the article was revised. Studies unrelated to the question of interest in the title or abstract

were excluded and the studies that met the requirements
specified for the quality review were included. From the
selected articles, we obtained by means of two independent reviewers using a format of data collection, the study
reference, work date (year), authors, quality RCT (random
sequence, allocation, blinding), eligibility criteria (population , intervention, comparison and outcome, reason for
excluding), study design, study duration, number of participants in the intervention group, number of participants
in the placebo group, age, sex, country, comorbidities,
ethnicity, drug doses, days of treatment, route of administration, side effects, number of patients lost to follow
up, outcomes as mean or median differences according
to the difference between the baseline measurement and
follow-up measurement or percentage change as reported,
confidence intervals if included, subgroup analysis if
applicable, sources of funding, if they had discrepancies
between the two reviewers, a third reviewer assessed the
article. A tool provided by the Cochrane Collaboration for
assessing the domains of sequence generation, allocation,
masking, selective results and other items was used [17].
A format in Excel 2013 for data collection was built and a
narrative description of the studies and their characteristics was performed because the differences in interventions (differences in dose and frequency of administration)
and in the outcomes were anticipated. Therefore no metaanalysis was considered for publication. The present study
had funding from Novartis Pharmaceuticals.

Results

770 records (Figure 1) were obtained, of these 720
results were excluded when reviewing the title and because of repeated citations, and 18 were excluded when
reviewing the abstract. 6 articles were included for final
review. Of these 1 was excluded for not meeting inclusion criteria (no randomization) [18]. There were 5 studies left to review quality criteria [19-23]. The assessment
of the studies methodological quality is outlined in
Table 1 [17]. In general, a low risk of bias was identified
in the sequence of random generation among studies, allocation concealment and blinding. There were three
studies where there was no blinding of the staff preparing the medication at the center; however, this was not
the staff responsible for the administration of the drug
[19-23]. In each study the percentage of patients lost
was reported. The risk of bias due to patients lost was
considered low when it did not exceed 20%. All works,
except of Maurer et al., 2011 whom had a 22.7% lost in
the placebo group met this limit (Table 2) [20].

Five studies were included in the systematic review,
with a total of 1117 patients with CIU/CSU. The weighted
average age was 42.07 years, predominantly of female sex
(73%). Most of participants were Caucasian (85.6%) taking
into account the populations included in these studies

different follow-up periods (4 24 weeks). In one study,
the dose of omalizumab was calculated according to the
weight and the levels of immunoglobulin E (ranging
between 75 and 375 mg) [20]. In Table 2 we describe the
study, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, sample size,
interventions, number of participants included in the
intervention and placebo group, time of follow-up and
patients lost to follow up or abandonment of treatment.

Effectiveness

The main outcomes were the change in UAS7 in different periods of follow-up, change in the ISS in the last
7 days from baseline, proportion of patients with UAS7
less or equal to 6 in follow-up periods, change in daily
score of urticaria during follow up as well as change in
the size score of urticaria (wheal). Outcomes such as the
improvement in DLQI and Cu-Q2oL were also included.
Safety outcomes such as frequency of at least one adverse event and frequency of adverse events suspected to
be caused by the drug were included (Tables 4, 5 and 6).

Maurer et al., reported a significant reduction in UAS7
using omalizumab (75-375 mg every 2 to 4 weeks for
24 weeks) compared with placebo at 24 weeks follow-up
(change -17.8 UAS7 in omalizumab , —7.9 in placebo
p =0.0089) [20]. They reported a smaller area under
the curve for UAS in the omalizumab group, compared
with placebo (p = 0.0002). They also reported a reduction
in urticarial lesions score (—9.2 vs. -3.3, respectively, p =
0.0019) and absence of angioedema in 77.8% of patients,
compared with 36.4% in the placebo group [20].

Saini et al., compared the impact of single doses of
omalizumab of 75 mg, 300 mg and 600 mg vs. placebo,
on UAS7 at 4 weeks, with an additional 12 weeks of
follow-up to monitor security [21]. They reported significant differences in the dose of 300 mg and 600 mg
compared with placebo (300 mg -19,9 vs. -6,9 p< 0,01;
600 mg -14,6 vs. -6,9 p = 0,047). There were also differences in the ISS at week 4 of follow-up between the
dose of 300 mg of omalizumab vs. placebo (-9.2 5.98
vs. -3.5 5.22 p <0.001), but not with 75 mg or 600 mg
(75 mg -4.5 5.84, p 0.16, 600 mg -6.5 5.63 p = 0.56).
Regarding the number of weekly urticarial lesions, a single
dose of 300 mg omalizumab lowered this score on average
10.7 6.75, which is significant compared to placebo
(-3.5 5.17 p <0.001). The dose of 600 mg also significantly lowered this score (600 mg -8,1 6,0 p = 0,02) [21].

Maurer et al., in 2013 reported a randomized double
blind clinical trial comparing the use of 75 mg, 150 mg
and 300 mg of omalizumab vs. placebo every 4 weeks
for 3 months, followed by 16 weeks of observation [19].
The primary outcome was change in ISS at week 12
compared to baseline, showing significant reductions in
mean ISS with doses of 150 mg and 300 mg compared
to placebo (150 mg -8.1 6.4 300 mg -9.8 6.0, placebo

the treatment of CIU/CSU, including other treatment options such as H2 antihistamines and leukotriene modifiers
[22]. They found a significant change at week 12 in the
ISS (-8.6 95% CI —9.3 to —7.8 vs. -4.0 95% CI -5.3 to -2.7
respectively, p <0.001), in the UAS7 (-19 95% CI —20.6

weekly score of urticarial lesions (— 10.5 95% CI -11.4
to -9.5 vs. -4.5 95% CI -5.9 to -3.1 p <0.001) in the
DLQI (-9.7 95% CI -10.6 to -8.8 vs. -5.1 95% CI -7.0

angioedema (95% CI 91 88 2 to 93.8 vs. 88.1 95% CI
83.6 to 92.7 p <0.001) (Tables 4 and 5) [22].

Saini et al. in 2014, compared the dose 75 mg, 150 mg,
and 300 mg every 4 weeks for 6 months vs placebo in patients with CIU/CSU, despite the use of H1-antihistamine.
They reported a statistical improvement in UAS7 (mean
change -13.82 in 75 mg, -14.4 in 150 mg, —20.75 in
300 mg vs -8.01 in placebo), ISS (mean change -6.46 in
75 mg, -6.66 in 150 mg, —9.4 in 300 mg vs 3.63 in placebo) and angioedema free days 96.1% in 300 mg vs 88.2%
in placebo (Tables 4 and 5) [23].

After the end of treatment period, three studies reported the recurrence of symptoms in terms of ISS and
weekly score of hives. Maurer et al. 2013 reported statistical significant differences between 300 mg of omalizumab and placebo at week 18 (six weeks after ending the
treatment) being similar to placebo after 18 week. Also,
300 mg of omalizumab reduced the weekly score of hives
at week 18 comparted to placebo [19]. Kaplan et al. 2013
reported during the follow-up period significant differences
between omalizumab 300 mg and placebo at 33 week in

the ISS score. These gradually increased to values similar
to those in the placebo group after the 33 week, there
were no statistical differences between omalizumab and
placebo groups at week 40 [22]. Saini et al. 2014 reported
after 24 week, the ISS difference of omalizumab 300 mg
compared to placebo maintained to the 31 week, the ISS
increased to values similar to those in the placebo group
and at the end of the follow up there were no differences
between omalizumab and placebo groups [23].

There are also multiple case series and uncontrolled
studies reporting the benefit of this drug in the treatment
of chronic idiopathic urticaria (Table 7).

Safety

Maurer et al. in 2011, reported a similar incidence of
adverse events suspected to be caused by omalizumab
and placebo (22.2% and 22.7% respectively), with no
clinical evidence or any trends in laboratory parameters that were associated with treatment with omalizumab [20]. They reported 44% of adverse events during
the treatment period (day 0 to week 4) (placebo 47.6%,
omalizumab 75 mg 34.8%, 300 mg 48% and 600 mg
47.6%) [21]. Adverse events requiring priority treatment greater than 5% were: upper respiratory tract
infection, headache, nasopharyngitis, and dysmenorrhea. During follow-up (week 4 16), 40.7% of patients
experienced at least one adverse event (35% placebo,
75 mg omalizumab: 50%, 300 mg: 52.2%, 600 mg: 25%).
4.4% of participants had an adverse event that led
to discontinuation of treatment (pregnancy, asthma,

Maurer et al. in 2013 reported 59%, 67% and 65% of
adverse events at doses of 75, 150 and 300 mg of omalizumab, respectively, compared to 61% in the placebo
group [19]. Nine serious adverse events were reported,
of which 5 were in the group receiving 300 mg of omalizumab, two in the placebo group, one in the group receiving
75 mg and one in the group receiving 150 mg. Most
events were reported during study phases where patients
were not receiving active treatment.

Kaplan et al. reported an 83.7% frequency of one or
more adverse events in the group receiving 300 mg of
omalizumab for 16 weeks and 78.3% of adverse events in
the placebo group [22]. Of these, a relation with the intervention was suspected in 11.1% and 13.5% respectively,
and 7.1% and 6.0% were considered serious adverse events
respectively. Adverse events requiring priority treatment
were mainly gastrointestinal effects (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain), and presented at similar frequency in both
groups. During the treatment period, 65.1% of adverse
events occurred in omalizumab-treated patients vs. 63.9%
in the placebo group, the most common being headache
and upper respiratory tract infections in the omalizumab

group and nasal congestion, migraine and idiopathic urticaria in the placebo group. In the follow-up period, the incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups (52%
vs. 47% respectively). There was 2.8% of serious adverse
events with omalizumab and 3.6% with placebo. No serious adverse events related to treatment were reported
in this study.

Saini et al. 2014 reported any adverse event in 300 mg
of omalizumab 70.4%, 82.8% in 150 mg, 78.6% in 75 mg
and 66.3% in the placebo group. The most common
symptoms were headaches, arthralgia and injection-site
reactions in omalizumab group as compared with placebo.
The proportion of patients with adverse events reported
as suspected to be cause by the study drug increased as
the dose of omalizumab increased. There were 2 severe
events in 150 mg and 300 mg groups. In this study three
patients had suspected anaphylaxis, two of them during
omalizumab treatment and one 142 days post final dose of
study drug althought the anaphylaxis was not attributed
to study drug [23].

Discussion
Although CIU/CSU is a disease with a low probability of
death, it has a high impact on the quality of life of
Carrillo et al. World Allergy Organization Journal (2014)7:72

affected individuals. The therapeutic options available,
mainly H1 antihistamines and anti-leukotrienes may not
be sufficient to achieve adequate control of symptoms
(8]. In this subgroup of patients in whom the use of immunosuppressive agents is indicated as an alternative,
the use of omalizumab for the treatment of CIU/CSU
has been proposed [3,8,18]. Although little information is
yet available about this drug, its safety has been demonstrated in patients with asthma. This is the first systematic
review of omalizumab in chronic idiopathic urticaria
reported in the literature. Of 1117 patients obtained,
831 received at least one dose of omalizumab in randomized controlled clinical trials with placebo. There are also
multiple case series and uncontrolled studies reporting
the benefit of this drug in the treatment of various types
of CU.

The different doses used in the studies show a clear
benefit of using omalizumab 300 mg compared with
placebo in the treatment of the disease. One of the most
important limitations was the use of different doses
across studies, time of management, and follow-up of
results, which ranged from single dose to monthly doses
for 24 weeks. However, three studies evaluated the dose
of 300 mg that resulted in improvement of UAS7, ISS
and urticaria score compared with placebo. Another important limitation was the quantitative score of change
in the different scales, from a categorical scale of severity
of symptoms, making it difficult to perform a clinical
interpretation of the reduction in the average of each of
the scales. However, the authors reported a significant
minimum difference, and also on these scales, the score of
0 means no symptoms and the maximum score a greater
intensity of symptoms. The main strength of the studies
was that they were randomized clinical trials with adequate methodology and low loss of patients during
follow-up.

With the above, although no meta-analysis was performed by differences in the dose and times of treatment,
it can be concluded that the dose of 300 mg of omalizumab appears to be effective in treating CIU/CSU, but it is
associated with a higher frequency of adverse effects
(headache and upper respiratory infection). Further studies evaluating the efficacy of the dose of 300 mg of omalizumab in different population groups are needed, since
the reported studies included patients from Germany and
the United States mainly. The duration of effective treatment with fewer incidence of adverse events must also be
determined.
