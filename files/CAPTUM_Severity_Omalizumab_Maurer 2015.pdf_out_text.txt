Abstract

Developments increasing our understanding of chronic urticaria have resulted in the simplification and improvement of
available treatments. Currently, many treatments target mast cell mediators, but we can now disrupt mast cell activation
with the anti-IgE antibody omalizumab, which has markedly advanced the treatment landscape for patients with difficultto-treat urticaria. Current guidelines provide a framework for the management and treatment of patients with CU but, as
each patient is different, knowledge and experience of specialist dermatologists and allergists are key to effective
pharmacotherapy. This article reviews the different therapeutic options for patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria
(also called chronic idiopathic urticaria) or chronic inducible urticaria and discusses management of special populations
or special circumstances related to CU.

How the pathogenesis of chronic urticaria has
driven new treatment approaches

The pathogenesis of chronic urticaria (CU) is complex and not
yet fully understood. However, central to our current understanding of this unpredictable disease is the activation and subsequent degranulation of mast cells in the skin.'* The symptoms of
CU, i.e. itchy hives and/or angioedema, arise from the release of
pro-inflammatory mediators from activated and degranulated
cutaneous mast cells (Fig. 1).* Mast cell degranulation can result
from many different mechanisms of mast cell activation, including cross-linkage of immunoglobulin (Ig)E bound to the highaffinity IgE receptors (FceRI) on the surface of mast cells.*° The
release of histamine and other pro-inflammatory mediators from
degranulated mast cells leads to hives and angioedema through
increased capillary permeability and erythema, via vasodilation.*”
The itch associated with hives is also induced by mast cell mediators, through stimulation of dermal sensory nerve fibres.>”

JEADV 2015, 29 (Suppl. 3), 16-32

Evidence suggests that mast cells can exist within a spectrum
of activation states, and that activation, priming and degranulation of mast cells are separate processes that can be triggered by
a number of mechanisms.® Furthermore, the degranulation of
mast cells in CU can be due to different mechanisms in different
patients.’ Up to 45% of patients with CU have IgG autoantibodies directed against either IgE (5-10%) or FceRI (35-40%).
These IgG autoantibodies can bind to and cross-link FceRI on
mast cells and basophils, resulting in their activation."*° This
autoimmune characteristic of the disease is now regularly
assessed by physicians, by means of the Autologous Serum
Skin Test (ASST), to aid in specific diagnosis of autoimmunerelated urticaria.2!° Mast cell degranulation in CU may also
result from infection-associated signals including complement
components, autoallergens, neuropeptides and other unknown
mechanisms. In addition to these, various other non-immunological factors can prime or trigger mast cells to induce inflam

or treatments such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs).8!512

The treatment of CU is similar to that of any other mast celldependent disease or allergic condition, namely to (i) avoid the
cause or trigger/stimulus; (ii) reduce the release of mast cell
mediators or the effects of these mediators on target organs with
pharmacotherapy; and (iii) induce tolerance.* Guidelines from
the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology
(EAACI), Global Allergy and Asthma European Network
(GA°7LEN), European Dermatology Forum (EDF) and World
Allergy Organization (WAO) recommend licensed doses of
modern, second-generation, non-sedating H,-antihistamines as
first-line treatment; if symptoms persist after 2 weeks, dose escalation (up to four times) is advised (Fig. 2)2

The benefits of higher doses of non-sedating H,-antihistamines have been well documented. For example, the efficacy of

higher doses of levocetirizine in patients with difficult-to-treat
CU was demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind study, in
which the proportion of symptom-free patients increased from
22% at week 1 to 55% at week 3 following a four-fold increase in
the levocetirizine dose from 5 to 20 mg.'* Despite the increased
dose, 45% of CU patients remained unresponsive to treatment.
In those patients whose CU is inadequately controlled by
licensed or higher doses of H;-antihistamines, guidelines recommend the third-line addition of omalizumab, ciclosporin or the
leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) montelukast to existing
H,-antihistamine therapy (Fig. 2; more details on the selection
of recommended third-line treatments can be found in the EAACI/GA*LEN/EDF/WAO urticaria guidelines).? Of the recommended third-line treatment options, omalizumab is the only
option licensed for use as add-on therapy for the treatment of

 

chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) (also called chronic idiopathic urticaria [CIU]). Although the efficacy and tolerability of
omalizumab have been well established,'* '° its exact mechanism
of action has yet to be confirmed.

Omalizumab is a humanized, monoclonal, anti-IgE antibody
(rhuMab-E25) comprising a human IgG framework onto which
are grafted the complementarity-determining regions from a
murine anti-IgE antibody.'” Omalizumab binds to free IgE in the
blood and interstitial space, forming biologically inactive IgE
complexes that are unable to bind to FceRI on the surface of mast
cells and basophils.*!” As such, omalizumab reduces the amount
of free IgE, i.e. available to trigger mast cell and basophil degranulation and the subsequent inflammatory cascade. By forming
inactive complexes with IgE, omalizumab can also indirectly bind
and sequester free allergens and possibly autoallergens such as
thyroperoxidase and double-stranded DNA, which can bind to
the sequestered IgE.* These may be the mechanisms for the rapid
response (hours to days), ie. seen in many cases of omalizumab
treatment (M. K. Church,
also an important consequence of free IgE sequestration by omalizumab, which is the down-regulation of FceRI on the surface of
mast cells and basophils, and a subsequent reduced sensitivity
and/or responsiveness of these cells to allergens or activating autoantibodies.*!°”° This may be an explanation for the slower

response (days to weeks), i.e. also seen in many cases of omalizumab treatment (M. K. Church, personal communication).®!*
Overall, the effect of omalizumab in urticaria is a downgrading
of the IgE-FceRI-mast ce
for mast cell activation.* This decreased sensitivity and respon
 

axis and an increase in the threshold

siveness of mast cells leads to increased stability and reduced
degranulation, which ultimately culminates in reduced urticarial
symptoms.*!° Furthermore, omalizumab has been shown to
also cause decreased release of inflammatory mediators and
cytokines from basophils in the vasculature [e.g. interleukin
(IL)-6 and tumour-necrosis factor (TNF) «] and decreased
recruitment of other immune cells (e.g. T cells, macrophages,
eosinophils), thus reducing local inflammation.*

The beneficial effects of omalizumab in CSU were demonstrated in several multicentre randomized controlled trials (XCUISITE”!, MYSTIQUE”, ASTERIA I'°, ASTERIA II’* and
GLACIAL"), and its efficacy and safety has been confirmed by

clinical and real-life studies'*** °°

small and patient case
reports.°° °° A retrospective, real-life study investigated optimal
dosing, efficacy and safety of omalizumab and time to relapse
following treatment discontinuation in 51 patients with CU.'*
The study included 20 patients with CSU alone, 21 patients with
chronic inducible urticaria (CINDU) and 10 patients with both
CSU and CINDU. In addition to confirming the efficacy of omalizumab, results demonstrated its rapid onset of action, with
complete remission seen in 12 of 21 (57%) patients with CSU
within 1 week of treatment and in a further six patients (29%)
within 4 weeks. The majority of CSU patients included in the
study had complete remission with omalizumab 300 mg every
4 weeks.'* The same study group also assessed the response of
patients who received omalizumab retreatment.” On re-initiating omalizumab, all patients reported a rapid and complete
response after the first injection within the first 4 weeks.*°

Management of CU

General principles for the treatment of CU

With certain types of CU, a more definitive treatment may be
possible, e.g. in cases of Helicobacter pylori-associated urticaria,*!
or the development of CU signs and symptoms can be prevented
by avoidance of eliciting triggers, e.g. cold in cold urticaria.” In
CSU, it is notoriously difficult to eradicate underlying causes or
target unspecific and unknown triggers; thus pharmacotherapy
is key to effective treatment, with the aim being complete control
of symptoms. Physicians should continue to treat the disease
until the symptoms have subsided or until spontaneous remission of the disease occurs.”

First-generation, sedating H,-antihistamines are not recommended for the treatment of CU.* Unfortunately, patients can
now purchase sedating H,-antihistamines, often without the
guidance of pharmacists or physicians. Evidence has clearly
shown that first-generation antihistamines cause significant
drowsiness compared to modern, second-generation, non-sedating,
non-impairing H-antihistamines. A study of patients allergic to
ragweed showed that the sedating H,-antihistamine, diphenhydramine, caused a significant impairment of simulated driving
(comparable to patients who had received alcohol) when
compared to the non-sedating H,-antihistamine fexofenadine
(Fig. 3a).°? Furthermore, despite their ability to cause drowsiness and potentially induce sleep, treatment with sedating

 

H,-antihistamines, can cause reduced quality of sleep with
delayed and decreased periods of rapid-eye-movement (REM)
sleep. Data also suggest that this poor quality sleep leads to
after-effects the following day including drowsiness, impaired

concentration and impaired memory.”

each at twice the standard dose

General principles for the treatment of CSU
The aim for treatment of CSU is complete control of symptoms.
Recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of CSU
were described earlier (Fig. 2).? First- and second-line therapy
with non-sedating H,-antihistamines predominantly targets
mast cell mediators. Third-line, add-on therapy includes omalizumab, ciclosporin and the LTRA montelukast. LTRAs, and
potentially ciclosporin, also target mast cell mediators, although
the specific mechanism of action of ciclosporin is unknown. We
can disrupt mast cell activation by targeting the main mast cellactivating signal, IgE.* IgE-induced mast cell activation is one of
the crucial links between the cause and the symptoms of CSU,
and anti-IgE therapy has dramatically improved the treatment of
patients with long-term, refractory CSU.?”'°

Based on data from three phase III clinical trials (ASTERIA I,
ASTERIA II and GLACIAL),'*?° involving over 900 patients
with inadequately controlled CSU, omalizumab was approved in
Europe as add-on therapy for the treatment of CSU in adult and
adolescent (>12 years) patients showing an inadequate response
to H1-antihistamine treatment, and has since been approved in
many other countries.*°°° The treatment population in the
phase III clinical trials were representative of the global, refractory CSU population. For example, in ASTERIA II,’* patients
had a mean age of 42 years, 76% were female, 40% had
angioedema, mean IgE levels were 179 IU/mL and the median
duration of CSU was 3.3 years. Patients in ASTERIA II were randomized to omalizumab (75, 150 or 300 mg) or placebo every
4 weeks. After the first injection of omalizumab, particularly
with the 300 mg dose, the hives score was rapidly and significantly reduced and this was maintained over the treatment dura
 

tion (Fig. 4a). After treatment was discontinued, the symptoms
returned to levels seen in the placebo group. There was also a
significant increase in percentage of responders at week 12
(UAS7 score <6) with 150 or 300 mg omalizumab compared to
lacebo (Fig. 4b).

Consistent and significant relative reductions in itch, hives
and overall Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores
were seen with omalizumab 300 mg vs. placebo in all three
hase III trials, as well as significant increases in the percentage of responders at week 12 (UAS7 < 6) (Table pif tears
Relative reductions were also seen with omalizumab vs.
lacebo in individual DLQI domain scores. Omalizumab
(300 mg) showed a significant improvement compared to
lacebo in all three phase III trials in the symptoms and
feelings, daily activities, leisure and treatment subdomains and

 

a significant improvement vs. placebo in two of the trials in
the work and school and personal relationships subdomains
(Table 2).°°

Management of CINDU

General principle for the treatment of CINDU
The aim for treatment of CINDU is complete control of symptoms. Before the international urticaria guidelines were published,*°*! there was little consensus on effective treatments for
CINDU and, as such, cocktails of antihistamines and/or betaadrenergic agonists (e.g. terbutaline) were often prescribed.*?*?
Due to a lack of controlled trials assessing efficacy of many treatment options for CINDU, physicians must rely on efficacy and
tolerability data from single patient case studies or small-scale
studies. Beyond first- and second-line options, treatment recommendations are also based on the experience and knowledge of
dermatologists or allergists. Physicians can also measure the efficacy of treatments themselves by employing methods of threshold testing, which are routinely used for the diagnosis of many
CINDUs (e.g. dermographometer testing for symptomatic dermatographism™ or the critical temperature threshold (CTT) test
for cold urticaria).*°

It should be noted that the timeframe for treatment response
is variable and not definitive; some patients may respond
quicker than others. Also, certain treatments may not be available in all countries. Patients with CINDU who have a history of

 

anaphylactic shock are recommended to always carry an emergency treatment kit containing an epinephrine autoinjector and
non-sedating H-antihistamines.*°

Dermographic urticaria

Dermographic urticaria (symptomatic dermatographism or urticaria factitia) is the most common form of physical urticaria.*”
Given the potential for multiple CINDUs to occur in the same
patient? and the ease of testing with a FricTest® device’* or der
mographometer pen,*** all patients presenting with symptoms

JEADV 2015, 29 (Suppl. 3), 16-32

Maurer et al.

of physical urticaria should be tested with a dermographic challenge.

Prevention of dermographic urticaria is almost impossible, as
scratching (the key trigger for the development of symptoms) is
a natural way to relieve pruritus (itch), one of the key symptoms
of the disease, and even when not scratching it is difficult for
patients to avoid mechanical irritation of the skin. Consequently,
severe pruritus can have a detrimental impact on patients’ quality of life.°°?! In some cases, basic daily activities, such as dressing or combing hair, can promote intense physical symptoms.’?
This can influence patients’ choice of clothing, exercise, bathing
regimens and behaviour.” It is, however, possible to minimize
skin irritation by choosing light clothing and by avoiding activities such as vigorous towelling.°*! Skin hydration by emollients
may also help prevent scratching due to dry skin.**

Because of the difficulty of trigger avoidance, pharmacological
treatment is very important for patients with dermographic urticaria. Non-sedating H,-antihistamines are the recommended
first-line treatment of choice, and the dosage may be increased
up to four-fold in those patients who are refractory to treatment
with the licensed dose.”°

For those patients refractory to increased doses of non-sedating H,-antihistamines, there are a number of additional therapeutic options, including LTRAs and narrow-band UVB, that
have shown efficacy in individual trials or small studies; however, there is a lack of evidence from controlled clinical trials.°°°! There is conflicting evidence around the efficacy of
corticosteroids in dermographic urticaria, with only a few small
patient case studies supporting their use as treatment modalities;
as such, they are not recommended for routine use.?°* Of all
the physical urticarias, dermographic urticaria has the strongest
evidence base to support the efficacy of H>-antihistamines, but
even here the evidence is considered to be weak.**’ Low-dose
ciclosporin has also been shown to be effective in several patient
case studies; in a case series of six patients with severe dermographic urticaria, resistant to non-sedating H,-antihistamines at
higher doses, low-dose ciclosporin (starting dose >2.5 mg/kg/
day) significantly improved symptoms in the four patients treated for >8 months.”"

Omalizumab is currently being studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy
and safety in patients with dermographic urticaria refractory to
standard treatment.°° Omalizumab has also been shown to be
effective in the treatment of non-sedating H,-antihistaminerefractory dermographic urticaria in a number of individual
cases and small studies (Table 3).

Acquired cold urticaria

Acquired cold urticaria can have a significant burden of disease
for patients, depending on a number of factors such as the local
climate and their personal threshold for cold urticaria. In fact,
patients can have a CTT (e.g. 220°C), which can make it very

(anti-IL1) have all shown beneficial effects in cold urticaria and
are supported by individual case studies or small group studies
but lack evidence from controlled clinical trials.°°°" There is
an increasing body of evidence for the use of omalizumab to
treat cold urticaria, suggesting that thorough investigation is
required to explore its potential benefit in this setting (Table 3).
An ongoing double-blind, placebo-controlled study is assessing
the effectiveness of omalizumab in patients with antihistamineresistant cold contact urticaria (CUTEX; NCT01580592).

Cholinergic urticaria

Patients with cholinergic urticaria have a significant burden of
disease, especially related to exercise, bathing and sexual activity.°°°” In some severe cases, patients with cholinergic urticaria
are unable to undertake even mild exercise and are disabled
because of their symptoms.

The most effective approach in the management of patients
with cholinergic urticaria is avoidance of eliciting triggers. However, desensitization (through induced sweating or treatment
with autologous sweat) may be useful in some patients.4°°°°?
Pharmacotherapy for symptom relief may be achieved with nonsedating H,-antihistamines at standard or higher doses, but
most patients achieve only a partial response.** Other agents
have shown varying efficacy in individual cases (e.g. the anticholinergic agent scopolamine, methantheliniumbromide”®, B,adrenergic stimulants/blockers and botulinum toxin), but there

Solar urticaria

Patients with solar urticaria are often unable to spend time outdoors without triggering their symptoms. In a recent retrospective case series of 61 patients with solar urticaria, 95% of the
patient cohort required <15 min of sun exposure to cause an
urticarial response.” However, practically, patients cannot
remain indoors, so UV-resistant clothing and the use of highprotection, broad-spectrum sunscreen is routinely recommended.”*

Induction of tolerance in solar urticaria through phototherapy
has been reported to be effective;»”*’® and rush therapy with
UV-A (a rapid incremental phototherapy regimen) has also proven to be effective within 3 days.’”78 However, tolerance induction is transient, and patients require almost daily maintenance
with UV-A exposure.””° These effects can reportedly be extended
up to a week with pre-UV-A desensitization via PUV-A
photochemotherapy (administration of psoralen before UV-A

exposure), but continuous maintenance treatment is still
required.”°”?

EAACI/GA*LEN/EDF/WAO guideline-recommend first-line
treatment with non-sedating H,-antihistamines at standard
doses, which are effective at reducing itch and hives, but fail to
prevent erythema. Therefore, second-line treatment at higher
than standard doses may be required to provide symptom
relief.°**° Patients who respond to higher (two-fold or fourfold) doses of non-sedating H,-antihistamines are able to continue natural exposure to UV light, allowing them to develop a
natural desensitization.”* A combination of therapeutic modalities and exposure prevention has demonstrated effective results.
For example, a case series of three patients reported a synergistic
benefit of broad-spectrum sunscreens and non-sedating H,-antihistamines with a marked increase in tolerance to UV radiation
compared with either treatment alone.*!

Patients who are refractory to treatment with non-sedating
H,-antihistamines have a number of alternative therapeutic
options. In addition to topical and systemic steroids, plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG),°>8283 anecdotal evidence supports the efficacy of LTRAs, chloroquine and
an alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone analogue.°°’>****

An antihistamine-refractory patient with solar urticaria has
also been successfully treated with ciclosporin. The patient had
been treated with PUV-A and chloroquine phosphate without
success, and received ciclosporin at a dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day.

They showed decreased light sensitivity to UV-A, UV-B and visible light following ciclosporin treatment and, as a result, could
be out in the sun for at least 1 h with minimal urticarial flares.
Two weeks after ciclosporin therapy was discontinued, symptoms returned.®*

The successful use of omalizumab has also been reported in
patients with solar urticaria'**° (Table 3).

Delayed pressure urticaria

Despite a wealth of case reports and anecdotal evidence supporting efficacy claims for a number of different therapies, delayed
pressure urticaria (DPU) remains a difficult-to-treat disorder
with no broadly effective treatment.*” *° Management of DPU
begins by explaining to the patient the fluctuating nature of the
condition, and the association of pressure and delayed onset of
swelling.*? Patients may have to modify their behaviour, particularly physical activity, and may be advised to wear looser clothing and footwear.”

Non-sedating Hj,-antihistamines, at higher than licensed
doses, may be used to reduce the frequency and severity of swelling, particularly in those patients with concomitant CSU and/or
angioedema.”°**? However, in patients with DPU, the response
to non-sedating H,-antihistamines is generally poor and treatment guideline recommendations are based on low-grade evidence.”*” Combination therapy (consisting of the non-sedating
H,-antihistamine desloratadine in association with montelukast)
assessed in a small randomized controlled trial of 36 patients
with DPU, significantly improved patients’ symptoms.”

Patients with DPU may respond to oral corticosteroids, but
long-term use is not recommended because of the risk of serious
adverse effects due to the high doses that are often required.
Short-course oral corticosteroids may be considered in patients
refractory to non-sedating H,-antihistamines, especially if rapid
symptomatic relief is required.°°***! There is little evidence for

 

alternative treatment options. Case reports and small studies
indicate that chloroquine, LTRAs, oral coumarins (warfarin, nicoumalone), anti-TNF or monotherapy with dapsone or sulfasalazine can be effective.*”**°°? °4 IVIG can also be beneficial
in chronic DPU, but may itself severely impair quality of
life.®?°5

There is mixed evidence to support the use of NSAIDs in
DPU,*! which can themselves often be a triggering factor in
CSU associated with DPU. Methotrexate was shown to be an
effective treatment option in some patients with steroid-dependent CU; a retrospective case review of three patients with CU
and DPU reported a marked symptomatic benefit in one
(15 mg, once weekly), some benefit in another (25 mg, once
weekly), and no benefit in the third patient (25 mg, once
weekly). A steroid-sparing effect was seen in the patient with a
good response to methotrexate; the frequency of corticosteroid
dosing could be reduced from twice weekly to twice monthly.”
There are only two patients with DPU reported to have been

treated with omalizumab in the literature. In both patients, omalizumab was shown to be effective (Table 3).

Management of special populations

Current EAACI/GA*LEN/EDF/WAO guidelines for the diagnosis, management and treatment of urticaria include recommendations for special populations, specifically children, the elderly
and pregnant or lactating women.” The guidelines suggest using
the same differential diagnoses, diagnosis and treatment algorithm and treatment recommendations as for adults but with
consideration of factors such as age, dosage and availability of
child-friendly formulae.

Children

Urticaria in children is common, but correct diagnosis of the
specific urticarial subtype can be challenging.°””* While urticaria
can occur in all age groups, it is acute spontaneous urticaria or
recurrent urticaria, as opposed to CU, that most commonly
affects infants and young children (Fig. 7 a,b).””
number of triggers associated with acute urticaria in children:

There are a

physical stimuli (such as cold temperatures), contact with chemicals, viral infections (such as measles) and allergic reactions to
food and/or drugs.” '°' Of these, the most common trigger is
thought to be infections.’ Interestingly, evidence suggests that
20-30% of children with acute urticaria (the majority caused by
infection) go on to develop CU.’ When CU does occur in children, its underlying causes do not appear to differ from those
seen in adults, although subtle differences in clinical characteristics have been suggested, including shorter time to remission,
less frequent occurrences of angioedema and a reduced gender
bias towards females. Further epidemiological studies are
required to evaluate differences between these two populations.?°*!!°4 Diagnosis based on complete blood count,
C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate and
clinical history is essential in children to eliminate juvenile

idiopathic arthritis or hereditary auto-inflammatory syndromes
(e.g. chronic infantile neurological cutaneous articular syndrome
or familial cold auto-inflammatory syndrome), which can all
present with urticarial-like lesions.”

Regarding the management and treatment of children with
CU, the EAACI/GA*LEN/EDF/WAO guidelines discourage the
use of sedating H,-antihistamines.” This is particularly important, as children are more sensitive to higher doses of sedating
H,-antihistamines than adults and consequently are more likely
to experience side-effects.'°° Second-generation, non-sedating
H,-antihistamines are therefore recommended as first-line therapy, followed by weight-adjusted up-dosing if symptoms persist
after 2 weeks. Choice of non-sedating H,-antihistamine in very
young children will largely depend on its availability as an oral
solution.* Only those non-sedating H,-antihistamines with proven efficacy and safety (at higher doses) in paediatric patients
should be used; e.g. cetirizine, desloratadine, levocetirizine and
loratadine.'°° The guidelines suggest that all subsequent treatment steps should be based on individual patients. Short courses
of corticosteroids (maximum of 10 days) may be necessary during an exacerbation, but caution is advised due to adverse effects,
including growth suppression, which is particularly relevant in
children.'°”

Options for third-line, add-on therapy are as per adult recommendations and include the LTRA montelukast, ciclosporin and
omalizumab.’ Despite data being available (albeit conflicting)
on the efficacy of montelukast in adults with CU, there are relatively few published studies to assess its effectiveness in children.
However, it is well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile and
is licensed for use in children from the age of 6 years for the

treatment of asthma.!°°!?

 

A number of studies in children have shown ciclosporin to
be effective in treating symptoms of CU.'!®!!! In a small retrospective study of seven children aged 9-16 who were refractory to high-dose H,-antihistamines and corticosteroids, all
seven children had resolution of their CU symptoms following
treatment with ciclosporin, six within 1-4 weeks of treatment
and one within 8 weeks.'!° However, due to its side-effects,
the authors caution that ciclosporin should be reserved for
children whose CU is resistant to conventional measures and
that serum concentrations of ciclosporin should be carefully
monitored as well as regular assessment of renal and hepatic
function.'"°

Omalizumab is approved as add-on therapy for CSU in adolescent patients (aged >12 years) with an inadequate response to
H,-antihistamine treatment and is also licensed for children
aged >6 years with severe-persistent allergic asthma.*® Its efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in small case studies in
children with CU aged <12 years,'!”'' including a recent case
of an 11-year-old boy with severe, ciclosporin-resistant CU
in whom an immediate and definitive response was reported
following a single injection of omalizumab 300 mg.”°

JEADV 2015, 29 (Suppl. 3), 16-32

25

The elderly

Treatment of elderly patients (>65 years of age) with CU should
follow standard guideline recommendations. Second-generation,
non-sedating H,-antihistamines are recommended as first-line
therapy and, particularly in elderly patients, first-generation
antihistamines are to be avoided.” There are no reports concerning particular safety precautions when using the presently available second-generation antihistamines in this age group and
there are no published pharmacokinetic studies for most antihistamines in this population. However, since many elderly patients
have comorbidities and are receiving concomitant medications,
it may be necessary to consider their hepatic and/or renal function, which may impact the efficacy or safety of medication.'"*
Potential drug—drug interactions are now of less concern as astemizole and terfenadine are no longer in use.!'> However, due to
a lower clearance rate of loratadine in elderly patients (compared
to the normal patient population)'’® and with significant hepatic

"7 the use of these

metabolism of loratadine and desloratadine
antihistamines in patients with hepatic insufficiency or renal
impairment is not recommended (M. Gongalo, personal communication). There may also be safety issues with the use of systemic corticosteroids and ciclosporin, particularly in elderly
patients with hypertension and a low glomerular filtration
rate.''® No safety concerns have been reported with omalizumab
or montelukast in elderly patients with CU (M. Gongalo, per
sonal communication).

Pregnant and lactating women
Evidence suggests that the symptoms and progression of CU can
be affected by pregnancy. Some patients with refractory urticaria
have been reported to have spontaneous resolution of symptoms
upon becoming pregnant and a return of symptoms following
delivery. Conversely, some other patients with CU have reported
intense flares of urticaria during pregnancy (M. Gongalo, personal communication).'’” Although it is best practice to avoid
therapy during pregnancy, current evidence suggests that, for
those patients who do experience flare-ups, certain treatments
can be given without risk of embryotoxic or teratogenic adverse
effects. Differential diagnosis is important as other conditions
can present with more persistent, urticaria-like hives (such as
the urticarial dermatoses of pregnancy).'°

First-generation, sedating H,-antihistamines should be
avoided in pregnant women, due to the sedative effects. Secondgeneration, non-sedating H,-antihistamines should be the firstline treatment of choice, as they have been considered to have an
acceptable risk, and are classified as pregnancy category B (‘Animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the
fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in
pregnant women’).'*! Furthermore, in lactating women, a small
number of studies have shown that non-sedating H,-antihistamines are almost completely cleared from breast milk.'?”!??

infants, loratadine and cetirizine are the preferred choice for lactating, as well as pregnant women. Furthermore, the related
antihistamines, desloratadine and levocetirizine can also be recommended.'** 18

Use of corticosteroids in the first trimester of pregnancy is not
advisable due to the possible increased risk of cleft palate, and ciclosporin use in pregnant women should be considered with
extreme caution due to potential adverse embryotoxic and teratogenic effects.”*17°!°° Pul
elukast during pregnancy suggests that there is no increased risk

lished evidence on the use of mont
of major malformations above the baseline rate in the general
population; however, one study reported a significantly lower
birth weight of babies whose mothers had been treated with
montelukast.'*! Further clinical studies are required to be able
to fully evaluate the efficacy and safety of montelukast in pregnant women.

There is little published data on the safety of omalizumab in
pregnant women with CU, apart from one case study;'*? however, the EXPECT pregnancy registry, in patients with severe
allergic asthma treated with omalizumab, has assessed outcomes

 

from 169 pregnant women treated with omalizumab. No apparent increase or patterns in major anomalies were observed.'**
This is supported by recent real-life evidence in two patients
with severe asthma who were treated with omalizumab whilst
pregnant. In both cases treatment with omalizumab did not

affect their pregnancies or newborn babies.'*4

Management of special situations

The diagnosis and treatment of patients in special situations,
such as those with hypersensitivity to drugs, is a topic, i.e. frequently discussed amongst physicians, specialist dermatologists
and allergists. Recommendations from the EAACI/GA7LEN/
EDF/WAO guidelines suggest that if drugs are the suspected
cause of urticaria, they should be discontinued or replaced by a
drug of a different class (assuming pharmacological treatment is
essential).” They also note that drugs can often exacerbate preexisting urticaria; therefore, removal of the drug in such cases
may not always resolve symptoms and further testing may be
required to evaluate the actual trigger/cause. The following sections focus on acute urticaria caused by drug-hypersensitivity, in
particular that caused by the use of NSAIDs or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi).

Urticaria and NSAIDs

It is well established that aspirin and other NSAIDs can induce
acute urticaria. NSAID hypersensitivity is either termed NSAIDinduced urticaria/angioedema, if it has no underlying chronic
disease, or NSAID-exacerbated cutaneous disease (NECD) if
associated with CU.'*° Depending on the subtype of CU, it is
thought that up to 50% of patients experience exacerbations
associated with NSAID treatment.'*°

with NECD and those with CU who are tolerant to NSAIDs;
these data suggest that NECD could be classified as a sub-phenotype of CU (Fig. 8).'°° However, clinically, exacerbations manifest as hives or angioedema 0.5-6 h after drug ingestion; i.e.
there is a strong resemblance to the clinical symptoms presented
by patients with CSU (Fig. 9 a—c) (M. Sdnchez-Borges, personal
communication).'°>!** The prevalence of NECD is increased in
those patients with active urticaria and is thought to be dosedependent.'*° Furthermore, patients are often young women
suffering from dysmenorrhoea, who use NSAIDs for analgesia
and consequently develop acute monthly episodes of NECD (M.
Sanchez-Borges, personal communication). Oral provocation
testing to confirm diagnosis can be performed with one tenth
the starting dose of NSAID, increasing every 2 h until symptoms
occur or therapeutic dose is achieved.'*°

Although NECD exacerbations can be induced by different
rugs, a common physiological mechanism is thought to be
involved, i.e. the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1).'*° Furthermore, raised basal levels of leukotriene E4 can be found in
the urine of these patients, and these have been shown to
increase further after treatment with aspirin. Importantly, this
increase is not seen in those patients with CU who are aspirin
tolerant.'4° Management of patients with NECD is primarily
through the avoidance of COX-1 inhibitors, and the use of
COX-2 inhibitors. Paracetamol is generally well tolerated at
standard doses, although tolerance testing is recommended for

 

higher doses, as they can also cause hypersensitivity reactions
(these patients may represent a distinct subset of NECD patients
characterized by a different mechanism).'*>'*"

hypersensitivity to one particular type should be considered as
hypersensitivity to the overall drug class, and patients should
therefore avoid using all ACEi as a precaution. A study of 12 557
patients with hypertension estimated the incidence of angioedema due to a common ACEi (enalapril) to be 0.68%.'*? However, general prevalence of ACEi-induced angioedema is thought
to be between 0.1% and 6%, depending on the study and the
particular drug.'*? In the US, incidence is higher in AfricanAmericans compared with Caucasians, smokers compared with
non-smokers and women compared with men.'**!* Clinical
risk factors are obesity, sleep apnoea, immunosuppression,
recent initiation of treatment, upper airway surgery/trauma and
concomitant use of NSAIDs or some hypoglyacaemics (such as
sitagliptin).'*'4° Clinically, ACEi-induced angioedema affects
the orofacial and/or perioral area and/or upper airways most frequently (Fig. 10 a,b).'“” Approximately 30% of all cases of angioedema that present at the emergency department are ACEi
induced'“* and up to 40% of cases can be life threatening (M.
Sanchez-Borges, personal communication). '“°

The pathogenesis of ACEi-induced angioedema is not yet fully
elucidated, but current understanding suggests that ACEi affect
a number of pathways related to vasopermeability and vasodilation. Primarily, ACEi prevent the conversion of angiotensin I to
angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. Secondary effects of
ACEi are to prevent the degradation of bradykinin (BK) and
substance P (SP) and cause local accumulation, and subsequent
vasodilation. Increased vascular permeability with resulting
extravasation, is then thought to cause the angioedema.'*”

The ACEi-induced angioedema should be suspected in every
hypertensive patient over the age of 40, who has been prescribed
ACEi and presents with angioedema. However, a thorough
patient history is important when diagnosing this condition, as
there are a number of other types of BK-induced angioedema
including: type I- and type II-hereditary angioedema with
Cl-inhibitor deficiency, acquired angioedema with Cl deficiency
and hereditary oestrogen-related-type III angioedema.'*? ACEi
are contraindicated in such patients with hereditary or acquiredCl-esterase inhibitor deficiency.'*° It is important for physicians

to establish if patients are taking any concurrent medication. A References

study of patients with ACEi-induced angioedema showed that
approximately 50% were prescribed concomitant aspirin or
NSAIDs."*°

With regard to management of patients with ACEi-induced
angioedema, treating the angioedema is the main priority.
Cl-inhibitor concentrate has been shown to be effective for the
treatment of ACEi-induced angioedema and is available in a
number of countries.'°! '? Icatibant, a BK receptor antagonist
has also been shown to be effective in a series of patient cases
and also a randomized clinical trial.!°* °° Recently, results from
a phase II clinical study of the efficacy and safety of ecallantide
for use in ACEi-induced angioedema in an emergency department setting were reported.'*” A secondary concern is the conof hypertension. Angiotensin receptor

antagonists are recommended in this setting because they rarely
induce angioedema.'** Patients should be periodically monitored during treatment.

Summary

Advances in understanding of the pathophysiology of CU have
helped drive the development of new or improved treatment
approaches. With all CU subtypes, the aim of therapy is to treat
the patient until the symptoms have subsided. EAACI/GA7LEN/
WAO/EDF urticaria guidelines provide a framework for the
management and treatment of patients with CU. Non-sedating
H,-antihistamines, recommended in the first- or second-line,
target mast cell mediators. An important development was the
ability to disrupt mast cell activation with the anti-IgE antibody
omalizumab, recommended third line as add-on therapy. Omalizumab has markedly changed the treatment landscape for
patients with difficult-to-treat urticaria and, although its mechanism of action is not fully understood, its rapid effects have been
demonstrated in a number of different CU subtypes.

As each patient case is different, the knowledge and experience of specialist dermatologists and allergists is an invaluable
addition to the direction provided by treatment guidelines and
is key to effective pharmacotherapy. Importantly, physicians
should be aware of potential differential diagnoses and factors to
consider when evaluating the needs of some special populations,
or in certain special situations, to enable them to make informed
assessments and treatment decisions. A broader understanding
of the CU landscape, taking into account data from smaller reallife studies and case series in addition to large randomized trials,
should improve the management of this disease and lead to better prospects for all who suffer with CU.
