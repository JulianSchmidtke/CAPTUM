ABSTRACT

Despite the established association between chronic idiopathic/spontaneous urticaria (CIU) and presence of antinuclear
antibodies (ANAs), the prevalence of autoimmune comorbidities in this population has not been analyzed. Here, we aim to
identify clinical and laboratory manifestations associated with ANA-positive CIU. ANA-positive patients were identified via
electronic data capture from the electronic patient record database of Leumit Health care Services (LHS) of Israel. Patient
characteristics, medical histories, and details of diagnostic workup, medical treatment, and follow-up were retrieved by
performing a chart review of electronic patient records (EPRs). The prevalence of target diseases among ANA* CIu*, ANA*
CIU~, and ANA~ CIU* patients was calculated. A total of 91 ANA* CIU*, 3131 ANA* CIU”, and 478 ANA~ CIU*
patients were identified. The ANA* CIu* group was characterized by higher prevalence of Sjogren's syndrome (SS)-A 52
antibodies (Ab) (7.7% versus 2.4%; p = 0.008), SS-A 60 Ab (11% versus 2.8%; p = < 0.001), and SS-B Ab (14.3% versus
3.2%; p < 0.001), compared with ANA~ clu* group. Additionally, ANA* CIu* patients were more likely to be diagnosed
with thyroid autoimmune diseases, higher C-reactive protein (6.4 + 10.3 versus 4.1 + 8.8 mg/L; p = 0.027), and more
profound basopenia (0.04 + 0.09 versus 0.15 + 0.11 cell/mm?; p < 0.001) than ANA” CIU patients. More ANA* CIU*
patients were resistant to four-fold standard licensed doses of antihistamines than ANA~ clut patients [11 (12.1%) versus
29 (6.1%); p = 0.046]. ANA-positive CIU is characterized by higher prevalence of SS-A 52, SS-A 60, and SS-B antibodies

and poorer clinical response to antihistamine medications.

t is estimated that urticaria will affect 20%-25% of
the population at some point in their lifetime.*
Chronic urticaria (CU) involves hives that typically
present for durations more than six weeks. Although
CU generally lasts one to five years, prolonged cases
lasting up to five years occur in approximately 14% of
patients.” Chronic idiopathic/spontaneous urticaria
(CIU) has no discernable external cause.? Autoimmune
CU (AIU) is implicated as a principal cause of CIU,
potentially explaining 30%-50% of previously idiopathic cases.’ In AIU, the involvement of pathogenic
autoantibodies causing release of histamine after reaction with immunoglobulin E (IgE) epitopes, or with the
a-chain of the high-affinity receptor for IgE (FceRI)
receptors, should be considered, whereas the presence of these autoantibodies has been found to be
related with exacerbation of the disease.’ It is well
accepted that the autoimmune mechanisms could be
detected in AIU patients by the autologous serum skin
test (ASST) and by immunoassay.*~” Due to the recog

nized correlation between the presence of anti-FceRI
and anti-IgE autoantibodies and positive ASST, in clinical practice, the positive ASST is generally suggestive
of the autoimmune pathogenesis of CIU.'°"!

Thyroid disease is the most commonly reported autoimmune condition in patients with CIU. Published
studies have reported frequencies of thyroid autoimmunity in patients with CIU ranging from 23% to 39%;
moreover, antithyroid antibodies do have increased
incidence in those with antibody to the IgE receptor.’”
Patients with coexistent thyroid autoimmunity and
CIU have a more severe and prolonged course of urticaria than those without thyroid autoimmunity.’ In
addition to thyroid disease, possible associations between other autoimmune diseases and CIU have been
evaluated. Confino-Cohen et al. found that 12.5% of
patients had one additional autoimmune disease, 2.1%
had two diseases, 0.1% had three diseases, and single
patients each had additional four or five diseases.'*

Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are a group of autoantibodies directed against corresponding antigens in
the nucleus and are found in many patients with systemic or organ-specific autoimmune disorders.'° The
percentage of CIU patients having a positive test for
ANAs (titer more than 1:160) is approximately 29%.'°
The detection of ANA in serum has been performed for
many years to screen for autoimmune diseases. Indirect immunofluorescence assay is considered the gold

standard. However, immunofluorescence assay for
ANA screening is subjective, labor intensive, and has
an imprecise end point and yields a significant number
of false-positive results among asymptomatic controls.!” The recently developed multiplex ANA assay
simultaneously measures multiple specific ANAs using bead technology (Luminex, Austin, TX).'®!?

To the best of our knowledge, there are no published
studies investigating the clinical and laboratory features of ANA-positive CIU according the ANA profile.
Although it may be important to recognize the presence of these autoimmune biomarkers to understand
the mechanism of CIU, it may be beneficial to investigate any clinical relevance or associations these autoimmune biomarkers may have to the clinical characteristics of the disease. The purpose of this study was to
identify clinical and laboratory patient attributes associated with ANA-positive CIU according multiplex
ANA assay markers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Patients and Setting

This study was conducted using the electronic patient record (EPR) database of Leumit Health care Services (LHS), a health maintenance organization that
covers approximately 720,000 residents of Israel naionwide. LHS has implemented an EPR system that
acilitates a database that includes comprehensive in‘ormation on the insured population and resource utiization, such as demographic data, records of clinical
visits, laboratory tests performed at a single centralized
aboratory, and diagnostic codes using the Internaional Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical
Modification. This database was used to obtain information on diagnoses and laboratory results by means
of cross-linking data using a unique patient identifier.
Data capture was performed using IBM Cognos 10.1.1
BI Report Studio software. Results of queries were
downloaded into Microsoft Excel (version 14) spreadsheets for analysis. This study was approved by the
Asaf-haRofe Medical Center and LHS Institutional Review Committee.

All patients with an electronically documented diagnose of CIU during the year 2012 were included in the
study, whereas the patients with a recorded diagnosis
of other forms of urticaria were excluded. All cases
with ANA-positive CIU were included in the ANA*
clut group, whereas the remaining ANA-positive
subjects without CIU were included in the ANA*
CIU™ group. Additionally, we retrospectively reviewed
the computerized database from our allergy/clinical
immunology unit for the period January 1, 2012,
through December 31, 2012, to identify patients with
ANA™ CIU (ANA™ CIU®* group). Patient characteristics, medical histories, and details of diagnostic

workup, medical treatment, and follow-up were retrieved by performing a chart review of EPRs. Detailed
analysis of antihistamine medication usage was also
performed.

Comorbidities were identified by specific International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical
Modification diagnostic codes registered by the attending board-certificated physicians. Every patient with
positive ANA was examined for the symptoms and
signs of rheumatic diseases. A patient was diagnosed
with a definite rheumatic disease if he or she matched
the diagnostic criteria of each specific rheumatological
disease. For example, the 1997 revised American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 1987 ACR criteria
for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 2002 European criteria
for Sjogren’s syndrome (SS), 1984 modified New York
criteria for ankylosing spondylitis, and 1980 ACR criteria for systemic sclerosis (Scleroderma).

Laboratory Workup

LHS’s central laboratory uses the BioPlex 2200 ANA
screen (by Bio-Rad; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA),
which is a fully automated Luminex-based system developed for high-throughput analysis of 13 autoimmune
analytes simultaneously in a single tube. This system
allows the simultaneous detection in one sample of 13
autoantibodies [reacting with SSA (52 and 60 kDa), SSB,
anti-Smith, anti-Smith/ribonucleoprotein (RNP), RNP-A,
RNP-68 kDa, scleroderma 70, centromere B, doublestranded DNA (ds-DNA) antibodies, chromatin, histidyl
t-RNA synthetase, and ribosomal P proteins]. ANA
screen is reported positive if any of the 13 autoantibodies
investigated is positive (above cut-off level), and this
report shows the actual levels of individual analytes.
For clinical-laboratory workup, all CIU patients at LHS
are routinely screened for the presence of antithyroglobulin, antitopoisomerase antibodies, rheumatoid
factor (RF), complement component 3 + complement
component 4 and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels,
erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein,
complete blood count, and liver enzymes.

Statistical Analyses

Data was analyzed using SPSS Software version 18
(SPSS Inc., IBM-SPSS, Chicago, IL). The mean and standard deviation were calculated for continuous variables. Statistical significance for categorical variables
was calculated using x~ test or Fisher’s exact. Twotailed p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS

We identified 22,266 patients that performed an ANA
test between January 1 and December 31, 2012. The predominant reason for measurement of ANA was presence

DISCUSSION

This study presents the clinical and laboratory features of 91 patients with ANA-positive CIU. There are
four main findings of this study: 1) ANA* CIU* is
associated with a higher prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity rheumatic diseases; 2) SS-A 52 Ab, SS-A 60 Ab
and SS-B Ab are more prevalent in ANA* CIU* than
in ANA* CIU~; 3) ANA* CIU® is characterized with
more profound basopenia than ANA™ CIU*; and 4)
ANA* CIU™ is characterized by less responsiveness to
the treatment with standard licensed doses of antihistamines and more antihistamine resistance.

ANAs are detectable in approximately 5%-25% and
are significantly elevated in approximately 2.5% of the

Allergy and Asthma Proceedings

population, whereas most individuals with a positive
ANA do not have an autoimmune disease.”° This is
consistent with the finding that the prevalence of all
autoimmune disorders is 5%-7%.7! Therefore, ANA
positivity in the human population suggests that
ANAs may be an important component of the usual
immune activation. Consequently, most of the consultations for ANA positivity seen in rheumatology clinics
are not associated with any identifiable disease.

CIU is associated with autoreactivity /autoimmunity
in at least one-third of patients, and details of the
autoimmune pathogenesis of CIU have been reviewed
elsewhere.? In our setting, positive ANA is observed in
10%-14% of CIU patients,” which is quite comparable

with that observed in other studies.'*1!°* The higher
prevalence among female patients in our study population was similar to that in other epidemiologic surveys of clu.*4 Although measuring ANA serves as a
nonspecific marker of systemic autoimmunity in rheumatologic disorders, its relationship with CIU is poorly
understood. Nonetheless, positive ANA has been
‘ound to have some correlation with CIU severity and
was strongly associated with refractoriness to antihisamines.’° In this study, we also evaluated the possible
correlation of ANA positivity with CIU severity and
responses to treatment (Table 3). According to the EPR
at the first visits, there was no difference in UAS between ANA* CIU* and ANA™ CIU* groups. Because
his was a retrospective study, evaluation of ANA*
CIU* severity using the UAS7 (UAS over one week)
was not feasible, limiting our ability to discuss levels of
CIU severity in this patient population. Nevertheless,
he clinical response to antihistamine medications was
more favorable in ANA~ CIU* group, whereas more
antihistamine refractory cases were observed in ANA™
CIU* group substantiating previous observation pubished by Viswanathan et al.'®

In the ANA* CIU* group, the prevalence of antiSSA and anti-SSB antibodies was 17.7% and 14.3%,
respectively and was higher than ANA* CIU~ subjects. Anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies are among the
most commonly identified autoantibodies in the routine screening for systemic autoimmune diseases, and
he presence of these antibodies may generally implicate underlying rheumatic diseases in the affected population. However, in our study, no difference in the
prevalence of rheumatic diseases was observed between the ANA* CIU* and ANA* CIU™ groups. On
he other hand, ANA* CIU* patients were characterized by higher prevalence of rheumatic diseases than

those in the ANA” CIU* group. Anti-SSA/SSB autoantibodies are characteristic of SS and may be involved
in its pathogenesis.*°7° Nearly half of the patients with
SS develop cutaneous manifestations, which may include xeroderma, purpura, and/or urticaria-like lesions.”” However, these autoantibodies are also prevalent in many autoimmune diseases and are neither
specific to SS nor correlated with its clinical severity.”
In most cases, anti-SSA/SSB antibodies appear many
years before clinical onset of SS.” Therefore, we cannot
exclude the possibility that SS-A 52 Ab, SS-A 60 Ab,
and SS-B Ab-seropositive CIU patients may have had
undiagnosed SS or may develop the disease in their
future. However, the significance of these antibodies
for determining prognosis and treatment in CIU remains to be determined in prospective investigations.
Due to retrospective nature of our study, we cannot say
whether our anti-SSA/SSB-positive CIU patients have
undiagnosed SS.

Although anti-SSA/SSB antibodies can be detected
in 70%-100% of patients with SS, they are also detectable in sera of approximately 30% patients with SLE
and in 5%-20% of patients with discoid lupus erythematosus.*” Moreover, anti-SSA antibodies can be found
earlier than other SLE-related autoantibodies and are
present on average 6.6 years before the diagnosis of
SLE.*! Notably, only 4.4% of our ANA-positive CIU
patients were diagnosed with SLE. Other ANA-positive CIU patients do not fulfil the ACR criteria to
diagnose SLE. Systemic lupus erythematosus is not
infrequently associated with urticarial lesions, generally fulfilling the criteria of urticarial vasculitis and
usually arising during the active stage of the disease.**
There are no published prospective studies to identify
CIU as the presenting manifestation of SLE. Nevertheless, in the study of Confino-Cohen et al., most patients

were diagnosed with an additional autoimmune disease in the 10 years after the CIU diagnosis.'*

In addition, although the prevalence of positive antids-DNA in ANA* CIU* group was 9.9%, actually,
without concomitant SLE and overlap syndromes, the
prevalence of anti-ds-DNA was 2.4%. Theoretically,
some of ANA* CIU* patients might have undiagnosed
SLE, because anti-ds-DNA can be positive for years
before clinical symptoms of SLE develop.”

The presence of antithyroid antibodies in CIU clearly
correlates with the presence of antibodies to FceRI (or
0 IgE), although there is not an absolute concordance
between them.*? Our study confirms the relationship
between CIU and thyroid autoimmunity as suggested
in the previous works.'4*4 ANA positivity has previously been reported to be approximately 7.9% in CIU
patients with thyroid autoimmunity.° Autoimmune
hyroid diseases are much more common than sysemic rheumatological diseases, and a significant proportion of the asymptomatic ANA positivity seen by
rheumatologists is related to thyroid autoimmunity.°°

Several studies have shown peripheral blood basopenia in patients with ciu.s738 Moreover, basopenia is
inversely related to the severity of CIU.*? Our ANAt
CIU* patients were characterized with profound basopenia. Such patients have previously been characterized by the high levels of autoantibodies.*° Basophils
rom patients with systemic rheumatological diseases
respond to anti-DNA and ANAs with histamine reease, and this response was well correlated to the
clinical activity of these diseases.*’ Moreover, in paients with RA, IgE-anticitrullinated protein antibody
can bind to FceRI on basophils and can directly activate
basophils of anticitrullinated protein antibody’ RA
patients.*? Whether similar mechanisms are relevant in
pathophysiology of CIU have to be addressed in furher studies.

This study has several limitations due to the retrospective design implemented. The prevalence of some
diseases in ANA* CIU™ group may be underestimated
because only symptomatic patients were screened for
ANA.

Additionally, we did not perform immunoassays for
he presence anti-FceRI and anti-IgE autoantibodies
and basophil studies, which can better identify a subpopulation of CIU patients with AIU.** Because laboratory testing may be justified based on its “reassurance value,” extensive routine testing in CIU is no
favorable from a cost-benefit standpoint and does no
lead to improved patient care outcomes.**

To further validate our findings and to better characterize clinical and pathophysiological features o:
ANA* CIU* subjects, prospective studies are needed.
Additionally, objective documentation of CIU severity
is necessary to accurately assess effectiveness of therapies over long periods of time.*® Principal features 0

any future investigation would be 1) an assessment of
all autoimmune biomarkers and ASST at an initial
visit; 2) evaluation of disease severity using a validated
protocol such as the UAS7; 3) an assessment of clinical
response to antihistamine medications as refractory or
controlled; 4) histologic features of urticarial wheals in
ANA* versus ANA” CIU; and 5) to better clarify the
real role of infectious agents in the pathogenesis of
autoimmunity and their relative prevalence eu.
