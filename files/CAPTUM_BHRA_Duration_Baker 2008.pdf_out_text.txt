Background: Altered basophil degranulation phenotypes are found in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU).

Objective: To evaluate CIU disease severity in relation to basophil histamine release (HR) characteristics.

Methods: Patients with CIU were recruited from allergy and dermatology clinics. Patients with recent use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants were excluded. Patients completed disease severity surveys and had blood basophils isolated and
stimulated for HR using polyclonal goat anti-human IgE and N-formyl-met-leu-phe. The HR was measured using automated
fluorometry. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to investigate relationships between HR data and CIU disease measures.

Results: Fifty patients completed surveys, of which 34 were further categorized into 2 subgroups based on basophil HR
response to anti-IgE stimulation: responders (=10% HR) and nonresponders (<10% HR). Responders and nonresponders
reported similar use of oral corticosteroids, work absences, and quality-of-life impairment but differed in their patterns of
medications used for CIU. Basophil responders had a trend of higher use of the emergency department for CIU management.
Multivariate regression revealed that patients with the basophil responder phenotype experienced significantly higher current itch
scores (P = .02) compared with nonresponders.

Conclusions: Quality-of-life impairment is similar in CIU basophil subsets. Patients with CIU with a basophil responder
phenotype report longer disease duration, a higher frequency of emergency department use, and significantly higher itch severity.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is a skin disorder characterized by recurrent erythematous wheals and intense itching,
with or without angioedema, for at least 6 to 8 weeks, and it
can persist for years.'? The pathogenesis of CIU is not
completely understood, but mast cell and basophil degranulation of histamine is thought to be of central importance.* In
the past decade, CIU with certain serologic features has been
termed chronic autoimmune urticaria Specifically, up to
30% of patients with CIU have circulating IgG autoantibodies
targeting the IgE receptor a-chain (FceRIa), whereas approximately 10% have IgG targeting IgE expressed on the surface
of basophils and mast cells.> Other studies® have found that
40% of patients with CIU have serum that contains histamine-releasing activity (HRA) as measured by in vitro testing
against normal donor basophils. However, these 2 serum
factors (HRA and autoantibodies to IgE or FceRIa) often do
not coexist in the same individual and have led to confusion

as to the serologic classification of autoimmune CIU.° Furthermore, attempts to classify CIU disease severity relative to
serologic factor expression have been hampered by the lack
of a widely accepted standard assay.7*

It is well established that basophils of patients with CIU have
altered IgE receptor-mediated degranulation.'!° Recently,
Vonakis et al'! reported that ex vivo activation of blood basophils in patients with CIU with an optimal dose of crosslinking anti-IgE antibodies is segregated into 2 groups based on
the degree of HR: responders and nonresponders. Patients with
CIU with nonresponder basophils show depressed (<10%) HR,
whereas basophils of patients with CIU with a responder phenotype show at least 10% HR. Furthermore, altered basophil
protein expression of the FceRI inhibitory phosphatases SHIP-1
and SHIP-2 correspond to the observed patterns of CIU basophil
HR and impact the generation of downstream molecules (phosphoAkt) relevant to degranulation. Evidence also supports that
basophil functional phenotypes are stable in patients with CIU
and persistent disease symptoms.!!!?

Because of the chronic discomfort induced by pruritus, the
anxiety induced by the relapsing course, the lack of a specific
cause, and the social impairment linked to unpredictable
attacks of pruritus and angioedema, it is expected that CIU
affects the quality of life (QoL) of patients.!*'* In recent
studies,!> Skindex-29 has been used to evaluate urticaria and
noted that QoL is markedly reduced in patients with chronic
urticaria. In the present study, we explore the relationship of
defined CIU basophil functional categories (responder and
nonresponder) to CIU disease severity as measured using

disease survey instruments (Skindex-29 and the urticaria severity score [USS]).

METHODS

Patients

Adults (>18 years of age) diagnosed as having CIU were
recruited from Johns Hopkins University allergy and dermatology clinics. The inclusion criterion was a specialist (allergist or dermatologist) diagnosis of active CIU. Patients who
had used systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants (cyclosporine or sulfasalazine) in the month before
enrollment were excluded due to the known suppression of
these drugs on basophil HR.!° Patients were also excluded if
they were diagnosed as having another skin disease, such as
urticarial vasculitis, atopic dermatitis, or physical urticaria, or
had other etiologies for the urticaria, such as a chronic infection or medication allergy. After providing informed consent,
patients completed a written disease severity questionnaire
and underwent venipuncture via a protocol approved by the
Johns Hopkins Hospital institutional review board.

Basophil Function

Blood basophils of patients were isolated from venous blood
by means of dextran sedimentation and were stimulated for
HR using polyclonal goat anti-human IgE (0.01-1.00 g/
mL) in duplicate using calcium-containing buffers, as described previously.'! Based on an earlier study,'' we found
that the 0.1-wg/mL concentration of anti-IgE is optimal to
define basophil functional phenotypes. Cells were also stimulated using N-formyl-met-leu-phe (fMLP) (10°°M) as a
positive control for basophil degranulation because this pathway is generally preserved in basophils of patients with
CIU.!! Automated fluorometry was used to measure HR."
Results for each stimulus are reported as a percentage of the
total histamine content found in an aliquot of lysed leukocytes derived from 1 mL of whole blood after subtraction of
spontaneous HR from cells in buffer alone. Blood basopenia
was noted in certain patients and was defined as total blood
leukocyte histamine content of less than 5 ng/mL.

Disease Survey

The written questionnaire was composed of 3 elements: demographics and health care utilization, the USS, and the Skindex29.'8 The demographic section included age, sex, ethnicity,
education, disease duration, family history of urticaria, number
of days absent from work or school, number of visits to the
emergency department (ED), number of systemic corticosteroid
courses, and the type of medications used to treat CIU.

The second element was the USS, a survey used in various
forms in many clinical studies and trials in CIU.!°? This
survey includes urticarial wheal characterization, itch severity, wheal distribution, systemic symptoms, and wheal duration.?? The USS was calculated as follows: urticarial activity
was estimated according to the number of wheals present at
the evaluation time and during a flare of disease. Wheals
were scored as follows: 0, no wheals; 1, 1 to 10 small wheals

(<3 cm in diameter); 2, 10 to 50 small wheals or | to 10 large
wheals; 3, more than 50 small wheals or 10 to 50 large
wheals; and 4, almost fully covered with wheals. Current itch
score is the patient’s rating of itch severity based on a visual
analog scale scored from 0 to 10 (none to severe). Itch
severity at its worst was scored on a similar visual analog
scale. The distribution of the wheals was scored | each for
involvement of the face, mouth or tongue, scalp, trunk, limbs,
palms, and soles (maximum score, 7). Associated symptoms
were scored 1 each as follows (maximum score, 6): (1)
nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or indigestion; (2) wheeze
or breathlessness; (3) palpitations; (4) flushing; (5) joint pain
or joint swelling; and (6) headache, malaise, and lassitude.??
Wheal duration was scored on a 3-point scale as follows: less
than | hour, | to 24 hours, and greater than 24 hours.”

The third element of the questionnaire was Skindex-29, a
validated 29-question dermatology survey assessing the impact of skin disease on QoL in the past 3 months. The scoring
of Skindex divides the questions into specific categories:
emotions, symptoms, and functioning. The scale score is a
mean average in each category.

 

Statistical Analyses

All the statistical analyses were performed using Stata version
8.0 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas). Multivariate linear regression was used to investigate the relationship between basophil functional data and symptom severity measures while controlling for potential confounders. We considered 3 primary
outcome variables: current itch severity, itch severity during a
flare, and Skindex-29 score. Comparisons among basopenic
patients, nonresponders, and responders were performed using
an unpaired tf test, with P < .05 considered statistically significant.

RESULTS

Basophil Functional Characteristics

Of the 50 patients who enrolled in the study, 46 provided
a usable blood sample for basophil analysis (Table 1).
Patients with CIU were divided into 2 groups based on the
basophil degranulation achieved with optimal stimulation
with anti-IgE (0.1 g/mL): CIU nonresponders (CIU-NRs)
(<10% release of total leukocyte histamine content) and
responders (CIU-Rs) (>10% release of total leukocyte
histamine content).!! Thirty-four patients had measurable
basophil function that could be categorized into CIU-NR
(n = 15) or CIU-R (n = 19) (Table 1). Of the remaining
12 patients who submitted a blood sample, blood basophils
could not be classified due to significant basopenia (n = 8)
(see the “Methods” section) or other technical reasons
(n = 4), such as the detection limits of the assay system.
Significant basopenia has long been recognized in this
disease®!°4 and was reflected in this study as reductions in
the histamine concentration present in a lysed aliquot of
leukocytes representative of 1 mL of whole blood (Table
1). The pattern of fMLP responses seen in study patients
with CIU was similar to that previously observed.?''! It is

known that fMLP is an independent biological response
and does not necessarily match the release generated by
anti-IgE. For example, patient 3 (a CIU-R) has an f{MLPinduced response of 2%, with an anti-IgE response of 40%.
Vonakis et al!! reported that the fMLP response from
CIU-NR basophils is significantly reduced relative to
CIU-R basophils.

Patient Demographics

A total of 50 adults were enrolled and provided complete
surveys for analysis. Patient characteristics are given for all
enrolled patients based on their defined basophil functional
category or based on basopenia (Table 2). Most of the patients (74%) were female, with a mean age of 44 years. It was
noted that 20% of all patients have a family history of hives.
Among the basophil functional categories and basopenic patients, CIU-Rs were significantly less likely to be white and
were more likely to have a CIU disease duration greater than
4 years compared with CIU-NRs.

Measures of Disease Burden

Among the notable measures of disease burden in study
patients with CIU was the frequent use of rescue systemic
corticosteroids (Table 2). Nearly half of the patients reported
using at least 1 corticosteroid course in the previous year, and
nearly three-quarters reported corticosteroid use during the

lifetime of their CIU disease. All the basopenic patients
reported corticosteroid use during their CIU condition. The
frequency of ED visits for CIU treatment trended higher in
CIU-Rs compared with CIU-NRs in the past year (33% vs
14%; P = .16) and during the lifetime of CIU disease (72%
vs 43%; P = .08). Patients with basopenia also had a higher
frequency of ED visits than CIU-NRs. More than half of the
patients reported a work or school absence related to CIU,
and this occurred at similar frequencies among basophil functional categories and was highest in basopenic patients. Regarding medication use, all the patients have taken antihistamines to control symptoms. Past medication use in the
subgroups was different. The CIU-Rs predominantly used
oral corticosteroids with antihistamines, whereas the CIUNRs predominantly used antihistamines, oral corticosteroids,
tricyclic antidepressants, and antileukotrienes, in descending
order. In the CIU-NR and basopenic groups, there was a
higher reported use of leukotriene antagonists and tricyclic
antidepressants, such as doxepin, for CIU symptoms compared with in the CIU-R group.

QoL Measures

The impairment of QoL was examined using Skindex-29 measures. The degree of impairment in the 3 categories of emotional, functional, and symptoms was similar between the 2
groups based on basophil functional category (data not shown).

Current Disease Activity and Basophil Characteristics
Regarding disease activity as measured using the USS, a similar
number of wheals at the time of assessment was noted between
basophil functional categories and was greatest in basopenic
patients (Table 2). Likewise, the characterization of an urticarial
flare in terms of number of wheals, itch, number of wheal
locations, systemic symptoms, and average individual wheal
duration was similar among the basophil functional categories.
Urticarial flares in basopenic patients were characterized as
having greater itch and systemic symptoms. However, in response to a measure of instantaneous disease activity, current
itch, we noted a significant difference between the basophil
CIU-R and CIU-NR groups (score, 3.36 and 0.92, respectively;
P = 02), with a difference of 2.44 (Fig 1). The higher itch score
reported by CIU-Rs occurred despite a similar number of reported current wheals. Basopenic patients also had significantly
higher current itch than CIU-NRs, despite a similar reported
pattern of medication use.

DISCUSSION

The findings of this disease survey of patients with CIU
support that these patients have a significant disease burden
based on the number of ED visits, health care utilization,
work absences, and use of systemic corticosteroids. We noted
that a subset of patients with CIU with a basophil responder
phenotype experienced heightened itch and increased use of
the ED compared with patients with a nonresponder basophil
phenotype.

Previous studies have shown that patients with CIU with
antibodies against IgE or IgE receptor have more severe disease**; however, the assays used to establish autoimmunity are
not standardized to allow for widespread use of such biomarkers.
We simultaneously evaluated a patient’s CIU disease severity

with measures of basophil HR. To our knowledge, this is the
first attempt to relate CIU disease severity to the function of a
cell implicated in the disease pathogenesis. Given the prominence of pruritus as a symptom of CIU, we compared current
itch report at the time of the questionnaire with categories of
basophil degranulation. In recent investigations!!!” of CIU basophils, basophil functional categories were stable across time in
individuals with active disease. We have also seen that CIU-R
basophils have reduced SHIP-1! protein levels, an inhibitor in the
FceRI histamine degranulation pathway, compared with healthy
donor basophils and CIU-NR basophils. This finding may contribute to higher HR and itch scores in CIU-Rs compared with
CIU-NRs despite a similar number of wheals and medication
use at survey evaluation.!! In contrast to CIU-R and healthy
basophil donors, CIU-NR basophils have higher protein levels
of SHIP-1 and SHIP-2, leading to reduced histamine degranulation via the IgE receptor.'! This basophil signaling abnormality
in CIU-NR may contribute to a lower itch score. There was
similar use of antidepressants and leukotriene antagonists by
CIU-NRs and basopenic patients, yet CIU-NRs had much lower
current itch scores.

Newer assays using CIU serum to induce expression of basophil surface activation markers have been developed to assist
in defining “autoimmune” CIU; however, they rely on individual donor basophils and are not currently standardized.*> Given
the lack of disease markers in CIU and of a well-established
assay for serologic factors, CIU basophil functional profiles are
attractive markers for exploring different clinical subsets of CIU.
The present data imply that patients with CIU basophil responder phenotype have features consistent with more active
disease, such as increased ED visits and longer disease duration.
These data also suggest that patients with significant basopenia
experience increased disease severity, as noted by the frequent
use of oral corticosteroids and work absences. CIU-NRs and
basopenic patients also have an increased history of leukotriene
antagonist and antidepressant drug use. An analysis of the indirect and direct medical costs in this same population revealed
that most costs are related to the large number of medications
used to control symptoms.?° We did not directly evaluate the
socioeconomic status of these patients and the potential impact
it may have on the medication differences noted in basophil
groups.

A limitation of this study is the ability to record basophil
function. Of 46 blood samples, only 34 could be classified
due to the basopenia and other technical issues. Because of
the exclusion of patients actively receiving immunosuppressive medicines or systemic corticosteroids, we likely have
excluded individuals with high disease severity. A larger
sample size is required to attain significance given the large
number of variables evaluated by the questionnaire. Although
the survey asked about medication use, it did not evaluate the
effectiveness of each class of medication. We have now
amended the survey to evaluate current medication use and
efficacy. The literature review initially revealed a specific
CIU questionnaire, the USS, that was included as part of this
study. However, the USS addresses the patient’s subjective

symptom scores. We added several questions to evaluate the
number of medications, onset of disease, disease duration,
family history, and health care utilization. Skindex-29 has
been used to evaluate urticaria in previous studies and noted
that QoL is markedly reduced in patients with chronic urticaria. However, Skindex is a skin-specific and not a urticariaspecific QoL instrument and, thus, may not be sensitive
enough to detect differences in urticaria populations. Since
study initiation, Baiardini et al°’ created a health-related QoL
(HRQoL) tool specifically designed for chronic urticaria
(Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire). Staubach
et al!> noted that social functioning and emotions were the
areas of QoL most affected in patients with chronic urticaria.
Grob et al?* used a French HRQoL survey and discovered that
chronic urticaria severely impairs HRQoL at the same level
as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis on certain dimensions. Overall, patients with CIU have a significant disease burden
independent of their basophil phenotype. However, the CIU
basophil responder group has features consistent with a more
severe disease based on ED use and increased current itch
scores that may be related to shifts in the FceRI pathway to
histamine degranulation in their basophils. The implications
of the existence of CIU subsets are to improve the selection
of effective medication classes and patient information regarding the impact of the disease on their QoL.
