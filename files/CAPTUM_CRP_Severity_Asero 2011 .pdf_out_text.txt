BACKGROUND: Autologous serum skin test (ASST) and/or
autologous plasma skin test (APST) are thought to identify chronic
urticaria (CU) patients with an autoimmune/autoreactive disease.
Immune-mediated inflammation and coagulation are strictly linked,
and coagulation activation has been described in CU as shown by the
elevation of plasma prothrombin fragment F1+2 and, in severe cases,
of D-dimer”.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the coagulation cascade is
activated in APST-negative CU patients as it has been described in
autoreactive CU.

METHODS: 43 adults with CU (M/F 15/28; mean age 43.5 years; 16
APST-negative patients and 27 APST-positive) and 30 healthy
subjects were studied. Prothrombin fragment F1+2, D-dimer, and Creactive protein (CRP) plasma levels were measured by ELISA.

Plasma levels of prothrombin fragment F1+2 in patients with APST-negative urticaria,
autoreactive urticaria, and normal controls. Horizontal lines represent the mean values. F1+2
plasma levels were significantly higher in patients with either APST-negative or autoreactive
CU than in normal controls.

Plasma levels of D-dimer in patients with APST-negative urticaria, autoreactive urticaria,
and normal controls. Results are expressed as ng/ml, and horizontal lines represent the
mean values. D-dimer plasma levels were significantly higher in patients with either
APST-negative or autoreactive CU than in normal controls.

 

    

 

 

 

Comparison between APST-negative CU patients, and controls

RESULTS: Prothrombin fragment F1+2 and D-dimer were elevated
in 7 out of 16 APST-negative CU patients. The activation of the
coagulation cascade was associated with disease severity. Males were
more prevalent in idiopathic than in autoreactive CU patients (M/F:
10/6 vs 5/22; p < 0.001). In patients with APST-negative CU mean
F1+2 level (242.8+33.7 pmol/L [SEM]) was higher than in normal
controls (151.849.09 pmol/L; 002) but lower than in
autoreactive patients (526.2+97.8 pmol/L; p=0.05). Similarly, mean
D-dimer level was higher than in normal controls (484.2+148.3 vs
229.5+16.7 ng/ml; p=0.03) but lower than in autoreactive patients
(1142.24317.4 ng/ml; p=0.05). In contrast, mean CRP was lower
than in autoreactive patients (1.06+0.32 vs 3.09+0.74 jtg/ml; p=0.02)
but not different from normal subjects (0.78+0.09 jig/ml; NS).

Plasma levels of C-reactive protein in patients with APST-negative urtic:
normal controls. Results are expressed as jig/ml, and horizontal lin
reactive protein plasma levels were significantly higher in patients with autoreactive chronic urticaria
than in normal controls. No difference was found between patients with APST-negative chronic urticaria
and normal controls.

Prothrombin fragment F,,, values = 229 pmol/L were considered normal,

D-dimer levels < 278 ng/ml were considered negative.
CONCLUSION: APST-negative CU prevails in
males’; in these patients the coagulation cascade is

 

activated although with a lower intensity than in
patients with autoreactive disease.
