Purpose: Limited data is available on the prevalence and risk factors of acute and chronic urticaria in children. Our purpose was to determine the
prevalence and identify the risk factors of acute and chronic urticaria in Korean children. Methods: This population-based study examined 4,076
children (age 4 to 13 years) who were enrolled in the 2015 prospective Seongnam Atopy Project (SAP 2015) in Korea. The parents completed an urticaria questionnaire that included questions regarding the duration, severity, and triggering factors of urticaria. Blood sampling (n=464) was performed to measure vitamin D, total eosinophil count (TEC), and total IgE levels, and skin prick tests (n=503) were done. Results: The prevalences of
the life-time, acute, and chronic urticaria were 22.5%, 13.9%, and 1.8% (chronic continuous urticaria, 0.7%; and chronic recurrent urticaria, 1.1%),
respectively. Acute urticaria was significantly associated with allergic diseases and parental history of allergy (P<0.001), but chronic urticaria was
not associated with these clinical factors. There was no significant difference in the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level between subjects with chronic urticaria and controls (P=0.124). Chronic continuous urticaria was associated with living in a new residence (@0R=2.38, 95% Cl=1.02-5.54, P=0.044)

 

and belonging to a family with a high income (a@0R=4.24, 95% Cl=

 

1.24-14.56, P=0.022). Conclusions: A total of 1.8% of children were found to

have chronic urticaria. Living in a new residence and belonging to a family with a high income increased the risk of chronic continuous urticaria.

INTRODUCTION

Urticaria is one of the most common skin diseases, and patients may present with a wide spectrum of symptoms, including sudden development of pruritic wheals or angioedema.’
Chronic urticaria has a significant impact on quality-of-life due
to the constant sensation of itching, regular recurrence, and unknown etiology.’ Urticaria is classified as acute or chronic form
based on the duration of illness. Chronic urticaria is diagnosed
when disease has been continuously or intermittently present
for at least 6 weeks.* The chronic and acute forms of urticaria
differ in etiology, pathophysiology, and underlying mechanism.’

An estimated 15% to 23% of adults have experienced at least 1
episode of acute urticaria at some time in their lives,’’ and the
prevalence of chronic urticaria in adults is estimated at 0.5% to
5%.°** In children, previous studies reported the prevalence of
acute urticaria to be 1% to 14.5%,'"* but there is little data on

the prevalence of chronic urticaria in children.*” Chronic urticaria is considered less prevalent in children than in adults,’
and most studies estimating its prevalence are based upon extrapolation from adult data,” hospital-based results,®”° or studies of the general adult population.”

Previous studies have reported that chronic idiopathic urticaria is associated with infection,"’ pseudo-allergy to a food,”
autoimmunity,’*"* and low serum level of vitamin D.'*'* However, there is little information on the relationship of chronic urticaria with type of residence, overcrowding, socio-economic
status, air pollutants, exposure to secondary smoke, and other

The aims of this study were to estimate the prevalence of acute
and chronic urticaria in children and to identify their associations with the demographic and epidemiological characteristics
of individuals, including family history, comorbidities, disease
severity, and environmental factors by using questionnaires.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study population

This cross-sectional study examined children from the general pediatric population who were 4 to 13 year-old and attended
3 kindergartens and 6 elementary schools as part of the Seongnam Atopy Project in Korea from June to July of 2015 (SAP2015).
We distributed questionnaires to the parents of 5,196 children
and received 4,434 completed questionnaires in return (response rate: 85.3%). A total of 358 subjects completed the questionnaire incorrectly (e.g. missing values or absence of written
consent) and were excluded. Therefore, 4,076 (78.5%) children
were finally included in this study. This study was approved by
the Institutional Review Board of the CHA Bundang Medical
Center. Written consent was obtained from all parents or guardians following a detailed explanation of the study.

Definition of urticaria

Based on previous studies,’”"!”' “lifetime urticaria” was defined by an affirmative answer to the question: “Has your child
had a problem with burning, itching or a rash resembling a
mosquito bite or swelling on the skin during his/her lifetime?”
Among those with lifetime urticaria, “current urticaria’ was defined by an affirmative answer to the question: “In the past 12
months, has your child had a problem with burning, itching, or
a rash resembling a mosquito bite or swelling on the skin?”
Current urticaria was defined as acute or chronic urticaria according to its duration,*” “Chronic continuous urticaria” was
defined by the presence of daily symptoms or outbreaks occurring 3 or more times a week and lasting more than 6 weeks.’
“Chronic recurrent urticaria’ was defined by the presence of repeated development of symptoms with intervals of at least a
week between each relapse and lasting more than 6 weeks.’ We
defined “ever diagnosed with urticaria’ by an affirmative answer to the question: “Has your child ever been diagnosed with
urticaria at least once by a doctor” We defined “current treatment” based on an affirmative answer to the question: “Has
your child undergone treatment for urticaria during the past
year?” Control subjects were children who did not experience
urticaria during their lifetimes.

Severity of urticaria
We used the modified urticaria activity score (UAS)* to assess
disease severity. In particular, the severity of urticaria was as

Risk Factors of Chronic Urticaria in Children

sessed by asking: “How many wheals were there when your
child’s urticaria was most severe?” Wheals were classified as
none, mild (20 or fewer wheals per 24 hours), moderate (20 to
50 wheals per 24 hours), or intense (50 or more wheals per 24
hours or large confluent areas of wheal). Pruritus was classified
as none, mild (present but not annoying or troublesome), moderate (troublesome but not interfering with normal daily activities or sleep), or intense (very troublesome and interfering with
normal daily activities or sleep).

Possible causes of urticaria

We asked about the presence of factors that might induce urticaria, such as exposure to specific foods, drugs, cold exposure
(cold water or air), hot air (after a shower or exercise), common
cold, changes in the environment, and stress."

Hematologic profile and specific IgE measurement

We performed blood sampling to measure white blood cell
count, vitamin D, total eosinophil count (TEC), and total IgE
levels (Phadia AB, Uppsala, Sweden). We also used skin prick
tests (SPTs) in 503 children to assess allergic sensitization to 22
common allergens using extract and control solutions from Lofarma (Milan, Italy): Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p.),
Dermatophagoides farina (Der f), birch, oak, elm, hop, egg,
milk, peanut, wheat, walnut, cod, pork, mussel, shrimp, apple,
peach, kiwi, orange, tomato, strawberry, and celery. A subject
was considered atopic if there was 1 or more positive reactions
(wheal diameter > 3 mm) to any allergen in the SPT.

Questionnaire data

A modified Korean version of International Study of Asthma
and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire was used to
determine the prevalence of sign and/or symptoms and the diagnosis of allergic diseases. This questionnaire consists of 3
main sections: (1) general characteristics, including sex, birth
year, height, and weight; (2) history of sign and/or symptoms
related to asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR), atopic dermatitis (AD),
and food allergy (FA), and family history, including parental
asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis; and (3) environmental factors. The environmental factors were: number of
family members living together; presence, number, and birth
order of other siblings; total days of activity per week out of
physical education class (0, 1-2, 3-6, and 7 days/week), type of
delivery (vaginal delivery vs C-section), birth weight, breast
feeding, weaning period, attendance at a daycare center
(among attendees: age at initial attendance and duration of attendance), exposure to secondary smoke, type of residence
(detached house vs apartment), age of the residence (<6 vs =6
years), floor number in the residence, presence of mold on the
walls or ceiling of the residence, type of ventilation, pet ownership, furniture less than 1 year old, change of residence since
birth, remodeling of the residence (replacing wallpaper, floor

ing or ceiling, etc), distance of the residence to the main road
(<50, 50-100, 100-200, >200 m), parental education, and parental income (<$3,360 vs =$3,360/month).

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 22.0
(IBM Co, Armonk, NY, USA). The relationships of different parameters with urticaria were determined using Student's f test
for continuous variables and Pearson’s 7° test for dichotomous
variables. A linear-by-linear (Mantel-Haenszel test) association
trend test was used to test the presence of a linear trend of the
proportion of urticaria and sex according to age in current urticaria. The agreement between current urticaria and treatment
history in the past 12 months, lifetime urticaria, and diagnosis
by a physician were analyzed by calculation of « coefficients.
Multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjustment for
age, sex, BMI z-score, and personal history of atopic dermatitis,
was used to identify independent risk factors of acute and
chronic urticaria (continuous and recurrent types). For all analyses, a P value of <0.05 was considered significant.

our criteria for the diagnosis of different types of urticaria. A total of 917 subjects (22.5%, mean age: 9.41.7 years) had a
wheal or angioedema at some time during their lifetimes, and
624 of them (15.3%) had current urticaria. We further classified
subjects with current urticaria as having acute urticaria (n=567,
13.9%), chronic continuous urticaria (n=27, 0.7%), or chronic
recurrent urticaria (n=30, 1.1%).

Table 1 shows the characteristics of the 4,076 study subjects.
These results indicate that subjects who ever had urticaria were
more likely to have asthma, AR, or AD, and that their parents
were also more like to have asthma, AR, or AD. The cases and
controls had no significant differences in sex, age, height, or
BMI z-score.

The percentage of subjects with current urticaria among the
total subjects decreased significantly with age (P=0.009). However, within each age group, the sex ratio of subjects with current urticaria (P=0.070) did not differ from that of subjects with
chronic urticaria (P=0.735). The « for agreement between lifetime urticaria and ever diagnosis was 0.389 (P<0.001), and the
for agreement between current urticaria and current treatment was 0.315 (P<0.001).

Clinical presentation in current urticaria

Table 2 shows the characteristics of the 624 subjects with current urticaria, which included 567 subjects with acute urticaria
and 57 with chronic urticaria. These 2 groups had similar demographics, hematologic profiles, allergic profiles, and parental histories. Interestingly, there was a parental history of AR in
64.5% of those with acute urticaria, 40.7% of those with chronic
continuous urticaria, and 69% of those with chronic recurrent
urticaria (P=0.036, data not shown). The 25-hydroxyvitamin D

Food was the most frequent cause of urticaria (n=236, 37.8%),
followed by changing environment (n=172, 27.6%). There was
a significant difference in cold exposure as a cause of urticaria
between those with acute and chronic disease (6.7% vs 14%,
P=0.043) (Fig. 3). However, there was no significant difference
in environmental change including sunlight exposure, exposure to allergen, contact, irritants, pressure, warm exposure,
stress, infection, or drug.

Risk factors of urticaria

We calculated the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for acute and
chronic urticaria relative to controls after adjustment for age,
sex, BMI z score, and atopic dermatitis (Table 3). The results
showed that parental history of asthma (aOR=1.71, 95%
CI=1.15-2.54, P=0.007), parental history of AR (@OR=1.71, 95%
CI=1.38-2.10, P<0.001), parental history of AD (aOR=2.07,
95% CI=1.56-2.76, P<0.001), remodeling of the house
(aOR=1.32, 95% CI=1.07-1.65, P<0.011), and moving into
house (aOR=1.47, 95% CI=1.17-1.84, P<0.001) increased the
risk for acute urticaria. Living in a new house was the only factor that increased the risk of chronic urticaria (aOR=2.12, 95%
CI=1.17-3.84, P=0.013).

216 __http://e-aair.org

We also calculated the aORs for chronic recurrent urticaria
and chronic continuous urticaria relative to controls after adjustment for the same confounders (Table 4). The results
showed that living in new house (aOR=2.38, 95% CI=1.02-5.54,
P=0.044) and high income (aOR=4.24, 95% CI=1.24-14.56,
P=0.022) significantly increased the risk of chronic continuous
urticaria (Table 4). No risk factors were significantly associated
with increased risk of chronic recurrent urticaria.

DISCUSSION

We found that acute urticaria in the study population was as
prevalent as other allergic diseases, such as asthma and AR.
The prevalence of chronic urticaria in children was similar to
that previously reported for adults. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first population-based epidemiological study to
estimate the prevalence of chronic urticaria in children. There
was no difference in the demographic, laboratory parameters
(including vitamin D), and allergic profiles of subjects who had
acute or chronic urticaria. However, acute urticaria was associated with a parental history of asthma, AR, and AD, remodeling
of the house, and moving into another house, whereas chronic

AAIR

urticaria was associated with living in a new house, but was not
associated with family history of allergic diseases.

A valid estimate of the prevalence and severity of urticaria can
be determined by a survey of the general population, because
most cases are treated by family doctors or over-the-counter
medications.’ The prevalence of acute urticaria in our population (13.9%) was higher than previously reported in Western
populations (3.4%-5.4%), possibly due to ethnic differences, demographic differences in the study populations,”” performance of surveys at different time periods,’ disparities in the
items included in the questionnaires,” and differences in the
external environments. In contrast to previous studies, our
study included specific questionnaire items related to urticaria
and is a community-based survey. Thus, the values reported in
the present study represent the prevalence of urticaria in the
general Korean pediatric population in an urban area. We
found that acute urticaria is a highly prevalent disease in children, as are other allergic diseases, such as AD, AR, and asthma.

Previous studies have estimated the incidence of chronic urticaria in adults to be 0.5% to 5%. We found the prevalence of
chronic urticaria to be 1.8% (i.e., chronic continuous urticaria,
0.7%; chronic recurrent urticaria, 1.1%) in children who were 4
to 12 year-old. Chronic recurrent urticaria” is also known as
chronic episodic urticaria based on the interval between episodes of symptom aggravation in chronic urticaria*”’’ The
present study is the first to report the prevalence of chronic
continuous and chronic recurrent urticaria in children. However, we cannot compare our results with those of previous studies because there is no data on the prevalence of chronic urticaria with subdivision by continuous and recurrent types.

Previous researchers have estimated the prevalence of urticaria in pediatric populations indirectly based upon extrapolation
from data on adults,’ by selecting chronic patients among all
urticaria patients who visited a hospital,””” or by examination of
asmall number of children from the general population.’ There
are no previous community-based studies of chronic urticaria
in children. Previous studies have suggested that the prevalence
of chronic urticaria in children was low compared to that in
adults. However, we found similar prevalence rates of chronic
urticaria in children and adults. More specifically, when we defined the chronic urticaria as chronic continuous urticaria, its
prevalence was 0.7%, similar to the point prevalence previously
reported for chronic urticaria in adults, 0.6% to 0.8%.*°

We found that acute urticaria had a significantly higher risk of
co-morbidity with other allergic diseases, such as asthma, AR,
and AD, and with parental history of these allergic diseases.
This finding is in good agreement with those of previous studies,’”' and it is well known that acute urticaria is closely related
to other allergic traits.* A study by James et al.” found a positive
correlation between chronic urticaria and other allergic diseases, though another study reported a negative correlation.” The
latter study, whose results correspond well with our results, was

Risk Factors of Chronic Urticaria in Children

an epidemiologic investigation comparable to the present
study. In addition, we found no significant differences in total
IgE, specific IgE, or total eosinophil counts between the control
and the chronic urticaria groups, a finding in agreement with
that of a previous study.” These results support the interpretation that chronic urticaria does not have a significant relationship with systemic IgE-mediated reactions.

Our study showed no differences in the sex ratios of those
with acute and chronic urticaria, in contrast to several studies
of adults,’** but agreeing with a previous study of children.”
Our finding of a higher prevalence of chronic urticaria in boys
was not statistically significant. The explanation for this finding
could be similar to that previously proposed for other atopic
diseases in children and adults.*®

We found that the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was not significantly different between the control and chronic urticaria
groups, though there was no difference in age, sex or body mass
index between the groups. However, recent studies reported
that vitamin D levels in adults are inversely correlated with
chronic urticaria, chronic urticaria severity,'° and treatment
responsiveness of patients with chronic urticaria.'* The discrepancy between ours and previous studies may be due to: (1) differences between adults and children with regard to hormone
secretion as well as the uptake and utility of calcium and vitamin D;* (2) difference in control populations, healthy controls,
and controls with allergic rhinitis;'* (3) differences in vitamin D
levels (since the younger generation is at risk for vitamin insufficiency in Korea," vitamin D insufficiency may not have a significant difference on chronic urticaria as the other population of
previous studies); (4) the time of blood sampling because of
seasonal variation in vitamin D level differences (since the subjects were tested at a certain time of the year, the test results may
not reflect the overall vitamin D levels throughout the whole
year);'°"” and (5) the number of patients with chronic urticaria
is small in our study (it may not be the representative value).

We found that cold exposure significantly increased the prevalence of chronic urticaria but not acute urticaria, which is in
agreement with a previous study of chronic urticaria in children.” The BSACI guidelines also indicate that cold exposure is
one of the most common precipitating factors for chronic urticaria.” Thus, it may be that chronic urticaria is related to nonatopic AR or non-atopic triggering factors, but we cannot confirm this hypothesis.

Our finding that chronic urticaria was associated with more
wheals than acute urticaria corresponds with a previous finding that disease severity is greater in subjects with chronic urticaria than acute urticaria.” However, urticaria symptoms frequently change. Therefore, we measured the subject’s maximum symptoms; this scoring system is different from the urticarial activity scoring system recommended by the EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF/WAO Guideline, which states that the sum of the
scores from 7 consecutive days should be used in routine clini

cal practice to determine disease activity and response to treatment of chronic urticaria.” For this reason, the disease severity
of our patients cannot be directly compared with that of other
studies.

Interestingly, we found that higher income was significantly
associated with chronic continuous urticaria after adjusting for
confounding factors that are well-known to be associated with
AD (age, sex, family history of allergic condition, and past histoty).' Previous research reported that socioeconomic status was
associated” or not associated*” with chronic urticaria. In addition, we found that living in a new house and environmental
exposure were risk factors of urticaria. Further studies are needed to confirm the effect of indoor pollutant exposure on chronic urticaria in cases of remodeling house or moving into another house and to assess the relationships of environmental pollutants and indoor chemicals with symptoms of urticaria.*

The strengths of the current study include the large sample
size and the use of a comprehensive and stringent questionnaire. We also examined risk factors related to environmental
exposure and socioeconomic status. However, we could not establish cause-and-effect relationships and did not evaluate the
underlying causes of chronic urticaria, which include autoreactivity, intolerance to food, physical urticaria (cholinergic urticaria and delayed pressure urticaria), dermographism, and infection.° Thus, we did not confirm survey answers via telephone interviews. Although the reported prevalence of urticaria may depend on the diagnostic criteria, there is a reasonable
concordance of prevalence estimates based on questionnaires
and treatment or diagnostic history. Therefore, the prevalence
obtained via survey questionnaires may be similar to that reported in clinics. However, the current study is limited due to
recall bias with regard to the history of urticaria and lack of information on the use of antihistamines at the time of survey,
which may have influenced the skin test results. Another limitation is that the number of subjects with chronic continuous urticaria was relatively small and therefore may not have been of
representative value.

The present study is the first population-based assessment of
the prevalence of chronic urticaria in children. The prevalence
of chronic urticaria in children appears to be similar to that reported for adults. Chronic urticaria is influenced by potential irtitants in the environment and socioeconomic status, but it is
not influenced by the serum vitamin D levels, atopic status and
past history, and parental history of allergic conditions. These
results suggest that chronic continuous urticaria should be considered a disease distinct from acute urticaria. Further studies
are required to confirm the causes of chronic urticaria and to
delineate the underlying mechanisms.
