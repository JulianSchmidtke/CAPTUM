Abstract

Economic sustainability of long-term continuous treatment of antihistamine refractory chronic urticaria with omalizumab may be an issue. We assessed the efficacy of
relatively short courses (5-6 months) of omalizumab in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU). We retrospectively studied 40 patients (observed between
June 2015 and January 2019) affected by moderate-to-severe CIU refractory to antiH1 antihistamines (up to fourfold doses). Omalizumab was administered every
4 weeks for 24 weeks, then for 20 weeks in case of a relapse of moderate-to-severe
degree, then again for 24 weeks in case of a second relapse. Monthly clinical evaluations were performed. Mean disease severity significantly dropped after 1 month and
further decreased thereafter, with 30 complete remissions after the first course of
treatment. In 2-4 months, 18 patients had a relapse of moderate-to-severe degree.
The profile of response to the second course of omalizumab was similar to the first.
A third course was necessary for seven patients. No adverse effects were recorded.
Courses of 5-6 months of omalizumab may induce rapid significant improvement of
urticaria and many prolonged complete remissions. In case of relapse, further courses
show a similar profile of response and may induce additional long-term complete

remissions.

Since etiological diagnosis and treatment are not always possible or

may take a long time, symptom control strategies are important in the

Urticaria is a common disease characterized by wheals and/or
angioedema. Causative factors are multiple and etiological diagnosis is
difficult. This is particularly true for chronic urticaria, which often
remains idiopathic despite accurate diagnostic workup and significantly impairs quality of life and psychological status of patients
(Cappuccio et al., 2017; Foti, Antelmi, Mistrello, Guarneri, & Filotico,

management of chronic urticaria (Marzano et al., 2015; Powell, 2015;
Zuberbier, 2018). As first-line treatment, current international guidelines
suggest second-generation H1-antihistamines, which can be updosed up
to fourfold higher than recommended doses. In case of insufficient disease control, the successive step is omalizumab (Zuberbier, 2018).
Biotechnological (or “biologic”) drugs are a large, heterogeneous
class of pharmacological molecules. Biologic drugs are used for the treatment of several dermatological diseases, including psoriasis (Bartolotta

Khan, 2017).

Omalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively
binds to human immunoglobulin E (European Medicines Agency,
2019). Efficacy and safety of omalizumab for the treatment of chronic
spontaneous urticaria were assessed in three Phase III studies published between 2013 and 2015 (Kaplan et al., 2013; Maurer et al.,
2013; Saini et al., 2015). However, actual efficacy and safety of drugs
can be assessed only in postmarketing studies, on a much larger sample of population and in “real-life” conditions of use. A recent metaanalysis (Tharp et al., 2018) evaluated 67 “real-life” studies on
omalizumab, and 6 more papers were published thereafter until March
16, 2019.

Literature does not specify time limits for continuous treatment
with omalizumab. However, Italian regulations (Agenzia Italiana del
Farmaco, 2015) allow reimbursement of costs by the National Health
System only for courses of 5-6 months (which can be repeated
after 2 months, in case of relapses of moderate-to-severe degree). This
peculiar “real-life” condition is a limit, but also an opportunity to assess
the clinical response obtained with a relatively short -compared with
literature- course of treatment.

Few Italian studies exist on “real-life” use of omalizumab in
chronic urticaria, and, with two exceptions, they describe populations
of less than 20 patients. We present our experience on 40 patients

treated in about 3.5 years in our clinic.

2 | METHODS

The study was performed at the Dermatology Unit of the University
Hospital “Gaetano Martino” of Messina (Italy), upon authorization of
the local Ethical Committee. The clinical files of patients treated with
omalizumab between June 2015 and January 2019 for antihistamine
refractory chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) were retrospectively
examined.

Based on the literature and our experience (C. Guarneri et al.,
2017; F. Guarneri, C. Guarneri, & Cannavo, 2014; Marzano et al., 2015;
Powell, 2015; Zuberbier, 2018), all cases of noninducible chronic urticaria (duration: 6 or more weeks) underwent extensive laboratory
workup (hematocrit, hemoglobin level, white blood cell count, differential blood cell count, total eosinophil count, liver and kidney function
tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, antistreptolysin titer, thyroid
function test, urinalysis, examination of stools for parasites and occult
blood, and serum levels of C-reactive protein, glucose, proteins, complements, iron, ferritin, transferrin). When appropriate, patients were also
checked with other specialists for autoimmune, rheumatological, endocrine, infectious, odontostomatologic, otorhinolaryngologic, gastroenterological, hematological, allergic, cardiovascular, respiratory, renal/

urinary, and/or neuropsychiatric diseases, and additional laboratory/

instrumental tests suggested by these specialists were performed. Urticaria was classified as idiopathic when the above diagnostic procedures
failed to identify known causes. Oral antihistamines (standard dose,
then updosing) and short courses of systemic glucocorticosteroids were
used as first-line therapy (Zuberbier, 2018), and omalizumab was considered in case of inadequate disease control after 30 days. Because of
Italian regulations (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco, 2015), patients were
considered eligible for treatment with omalizumab when, despite the
use of antihistamines, their urticaria activity score (UAS) and UAS in the
last 7 days (UAS7) were higher than 3 and 16, respectively. In line with
these regulations, omalizumab was administered for 24 weeks (300 mg
every 4 weeks). After this period, a second course of 20 weeks was prescribed in case of relapse, with the same eligibility criteria. When a further relapse occurred thereafter, treatment was started again, with
another course of 24 weeks.

Sex, clinical history, age at first visit in our Unit, time of onset of
urticaria, UAS7 at each administration of omalizumab, type and dose
of other drugs used for urticaria before and during treatment with
omalizumab, duration of relapse-free interval after each course of
omalizumab, and need for additional courses of omalizumab were
recorded. Mean, SD, minimum, maximum, and quartiles of quantitative
data, and absolute and relative frequency of qualitative data were calculated. Groups were compared using Student's t test for quantitative
variables with normal distribution, Mann-Whitney U test for quantitative variables without normal distribution, and chi-squared test for

qualitative variables. In all tests, p < .05 was considered significant.

3 | RESULTS

In the study period, 40 patients (17 M, 23 F) with moderate-to-severe
antihistamine refractory CIU underwent treatment with omalizumab
in our Dermatology Unit. Their mean age was 51.33 + 17.76 years
(range 17-80, first quartile 42.75, median 52.5, third quartile 66.25),
without significant differences between males and females (males 50
+ 17.26 years, females 52.3 + 18.44, p = .69). Age at the onset of urticaria was between 13 and 79 years (mean 42.96 + 17.01), reported
disease duration was 8.37 + 10.80 years (range: 6 weeks to 40 years).
Also for these parameters, differences between males and females
were not significant (p = .59 and .87, respectively). Antihistamines
used before treatment with omalizumab were in decreasing order of
frequency, cetirizine (15 patients), bilastine (14 patients), rupatadine
(6 patients), ebastine (3 patients), fexofenadine (2 patients),
levocetirizine (1 patient), and unspecified (1 patient). All patients had
used one type of antihistamine, except two of them, who had used
cetirizine and fexofenadine. Thirty-three subjects had also undergone
short courses of systemic glucocorticosteroids, namely, deflazacort
(12 patients), methylprednisolone (9 patients), betamethasone
(4 patients), prednisone (4 patients), and unspecified (4 patients).

The results of the first course of omalizumab are shown in
Figure 1. Before treatment (TO), UAS7 was between 16 and 32 (mean
23 + 4.2). Six patients (one with UAS7 = 32, two with UAS7 = 31, two
with UAS7 = 29, and one with UAS7 = 28) also reported angioedema,

on 2-7 days in the last week (mean 3.3 + 1.5 days). A statistically significant clinical improvement was observed 4 weeks after the first
administration of omalizumab (T1), when a mean UAS7 score of 6.88
+ 5.08 was recorded (p < .001), with a range of values between O and
18 and nine cases of complete remission. The mean number of days
per week with angioedema decreased to 1.3 + 1.0 (range 0-3). After
8 weeks, one woman who had achieved complete clearance of urticaria decided to stop treatment, against medical advice, and had no
relapses thereafter (until the end of the study period). The remaining
39 patients experienced significant improvement at 8 weeks (mean
UAS7 score 2.87 + 3.46, p < .001 vs. T1 and TO). Mean UAS7 further
decreased, at a lower rate, in the subsequent 16 weeks. Three of
these 39 patients decided to stop treatment before 24 weeks, against
medical advice, because of complete remission: one of them stopped
treatment after four doses, two after five doses. Two of these three
patients had no relapses until the end of the study period, while one
experienced a relapse of urticaria 2 months after drug withdrawal.

At the end of the first course of treatment, the mean UAS7 score
of the remaining 36 patients was 0.64+1.55 (range O-7), with
30 cases of complete resolution. Compared to TO, UAS7 improved on
average by 97.67%. One patient reported one episode of angioedema
in the last week.

During treatment, progressive decrease of UAS7 was observed in
28 of the 36 patients, while the remaining 8 experienced temporary
worsening after initial improvement. This happened after the third

dose in four cases (in one patient UAS7 increased from 6 to 10, and in

the other three increased from 0 to 2, 3, and 7, respectively), after the
fourth dose in one case (UAS7 increased from 3 to 4), and after the
fifth dose in three cases (in one patient UAS7 increased from 4 to
7, and in the other two increased from O to 2 and 3, respectively).
Seven of these eight patients had one episode of worsening, followed
by decrease of UAS7, while one of them experienced an increase of
UAS7 from 0 to 2 in two occasions, after the third and fifth doses.

After the first course of omalizumab (complete or voluntarily interrupted), 22 patients reported no relapse or few episodes of mild urticaria
until the end of the study period. Conversely, 18 patients (including one
who had voluntarily interrupted treatment before 24 weeks) had a
relapse which required retreatment (UAS7 > 16), in a period between
2 and 4 months after last administration of omalizumab (mean 2.60
+ 0.68 months). Three of them (one with UAS7 = 29, two with
UAS7 = 16) also reported angioedema, on 2-4 days in the last week
(mean 2.7 + 1.2 days). These 18 patients were not significantly different
from the other 22 for sex (8 males and 10 females vs. 9 males and
10 females, p = .82), age (53.89 + 14.45 vs. 49.23 + 20.16 years, p = .40),
age of onset of urticaria (43.78 + 12.77 vs. 42.30 + 20.11 years, p = .78),
baseline UAS7 (23.11 + 4.86 vs. 22.91 + 3.69, p = .89), UAS7 after
24 weeks of treatment with omalizumab (0.89 + 2.00 vs. 0.32 + 0.84,
p = .27), mean improvement from baseline at T1 (73.96% + 24.51%
vs. 67.86% + 16.54%, p = .37) or after the entire course of omalizumab
(96.37% + 8.10% vs. 98.73% + 3.30%, p = .26).

As shown in Figure 2, the mean UAS7 at the beginning of the sec
ond course of omalizumab was 18.28 + 5.95, significantly lower than

mean UAS7 of 0.91 + 2.21 (nine complete remissions); none of them
reported angioedema in the last week. One of the 18 patients was lost
at follow-up after the second dose, when she had achieved a reduction of her UAS7 from 29 to 15 and remission of angioedema, while
for 6 the second course of omalizumab was in progress at the end of
the study period (January 2019). Two of these six patients had
achieved a reduction of their UAS7 from 20 to 10 and from 15 to
3, respectively, after first dose, while two had achieved a reduction of
their UAS7 from 22 to 3 and from 15 to O, respectively, after three
doses. The two remaining patients had received four doses of
omalizumab, with improvement in one case (UAS7 from 21 to 2) and
no variation of the initial UAS7 of 7 in the other. Progressive decrease
of UAS7 was observed in 9 of the 11 patients who completed the second course of omalizumab. In one of the other two cases, UAS7
decreased from 29 (baseline) to 7 after the first dose, raised to 23 after
the second dose, then progressively decreased to a final score of 3 at
the end of the course. In the other case, UAS7 decreased from 21 to
O after 4 weeks of treatment, then raised to 7 after 2 months and did
not change until the end of the course.

Seven patients who had achieved complete remission with the
second course of omalizumab experienced another relapse of
moderate-to-severe urticaria (UAS7 > 16) after 2-3 months (mean
time: 2.50 + 0.50 months). Two of them, with UAS = 17, also reported
angioedema on 2 days in the last week. These 7 patients and the rest
of the study population did not differ significantly for sex (3 males and
4 females vs 14 males and 19 females, p = .98), age (55.71 + 11.80
vs. 50.39 + 18.79 years, p = .35), age of onset of urticaria (49 + 11.78
vs. 41.68 + 17.81 years, p = .20), baseline UAS7 (23 + 5.89 vs. 23 +
3.87, p = 1), UAS7 after the first course of treatment with omalizumab
(1+ 1.91 vs. 0.55 + 1.48, p = .58), mean improvement from baseline
at T1 (74.02 + 23.29% vs. 69.88 + 20.13%, p = .67) or after the entire
first course of omalizumab (95.93 + 7.38% vs. 98.04 + 5.72%, p = .50).

The response of these seven patients to the third course of
omalizumab is shown in Figure 3. Initial mean UAS7 score was 18.29
+ 4.86. As of January 2019 (end of study period), five patients had

completed this course, achieving complete remission of urticaria. One
of them had experienced temporary worsening during both previous
courses, but this was not observed in the third. Worsening after three
doses (UAS7 increased from 0 after first and second doses to 8 after
third dose), followed by progressive improvement, was instead
observed in another of these five patients, who had never shown such
behavior previously.

Of the two patients who did not complete the third course of
omalizumab, one had decided, against medical advice, to stop treatment after achieving complete remission of urticaria and angioedema
in 8 weeks, while the other had received a single dose within the time
limits of the study period, achieving a decrease of UAS7 from 16 to
O and remission of angioedema. As of January 2019, the five patients
who completed the third course and the one who decided to stop it
before completion have been in clinical remission for 1-5 months
(mean 3.5 + 1.74).

4 | DISCUSSION

Our data confirmed the good efficacy of omalizumab observed in
Phase III studies (Kaplan et al., 2013; Maurer et al., 2013; Saini et al.,
2015). Among our 40 patients, nine (22.5%) achieved complete remission and 19 (47.5%) good disease control (UAS7 < 6) within 4 weeks
after the first dose of omalizumab, in line with literature (Kaplan et al.,
2016). However, improvements were rather fast not only for these
“early responders”: 16 patients achieved complete remission after
8 weeks (two doses) and 22 after 12 weeks (three doses), while those
who achieved good disease control (UAS7 < 6) were the vast majority
of our study population (35/40, 87.5%) already after 8 weeks (two
doses). For the 29 patients who achieved complete remission at the
end of the first course of treatment, the mean time to obtain such
result was 11.31 weeks, while for the 35 patients who completed the
first course with a UAS7 score of 6 or less, the mean time to achieve
that result was 6.74 weeks.

Noteworthy, and not often considered in previous studies, is the
duration of the results achieved at the end of the first course of therapy, a course which is relatively short (6 months) compared with those
reported in the majority of literature. More than half of our patients
(22/40, 55%), who had achieved complete or, in three cases, almost
PAPAIANNI er AL.

 

complete (UAS7 = 2-3) control of the disease, maintained their results
and did not require further administration of omalizumab until the end
of the study period (mean disease-free time 12.19 + 9.56 months,
range 2-38). To the best of our knowledge, the time limit of 6 months
for continuous treatment with omalizumab is defined only in Italian
regulations. Thus, our data can be compared with those of studies
performed by Italian authors (Bongiorno et al., 2016; Damiani et al.,
2019; Mandel et al., 2018; Nettis, 2018; Romano et al., 2015).
Romano et al. reported a higher rate of complete resolution than in
our study, but in a smaller population (6/9 patients, 67%), while
Bongiorno et al. reported, in a group of 18 patients, a 35.7% rate of
complete resolution, followed by relapse within 1-4 months in all
cases. The same number of patients (n = 18) was studied by Mandel
et al., who recorded 10 complete resolutions (58.8%) and recurrence
in three cases, after 4, 5, and 7 months, respectively. In this study, the
mean follow-up period was 9.5 months (range 1-28). Nettis et al.
reported a 67.8% rate of complete resolution in patients younger than
65 years and 56.7% in patients aged 65 years or more (322 in total),
and 173 patients (104 aged less than 65 years and 15 aged 65 years
or older) did not need a second course of treatment with omalizumab.
Finally, Damiani et al. observed complete resolution in a percentage
of patients similar to ours, but subjects who did not need a second
course of omalizumab were 25 in a study population of 127 (15/88
when considering only those with chronic spontaneous urticaria). The
reasons of the above differences are unknown. However, variability
could be due, at least in part, to enrolment criteria: some authors studied CIU patients, while others included all types of spontaneous urticaria and even inducible urticaria, because omalizumab showed
efficacy also in these forms of the disease (Arasi et al., 2015;
Bongiorno et al., 2016; Damiani et al., 2019; Kaplan et al., 2016; Mandel et al., 2018; Nettis, 2018; Romano et al., 2015; Tharp et al., 2018).

In our study, in line with the literature (Damiani et al., 2019; Mandel et al., 2018; Nettis, 2018), clinical responses to the first, second,
and third courses of omalizumab were similar. This characteristic is
important because some patients are subject to relapses of moderateto-severe degree after a course of treatment (mean disease-free interval is about 2.5 months) and need periodic retreatment. Gradual
increase of the interval between injections and/or tapering of treatment after remission are interesting possibilities suggested by some
authors (de Montjoye et al., 2018; Sussman et al., 2014; Vadasz,
2017), and further clinical research appears warranted to assess their
possible usefulness in inducing longer and more stable remission of
urticaria in these patients.

As for safety, no local or systemic adverse reaction occurred in
our population during the treatment with omalizumab. This is in line
with the literature, which reports that a minority of patients experiences adverse effects, usually mild (mainly local reactions at the site
of injection).

In conclusion, our data confirm that omalizumab is an effective
and safe treatment for antihistamine refractory CIU, and is able to
induce rapid significant improvements and, in many cases, prolonged
disease remission after a course of 5-6 months of treatment, a period

remarkably shorter than those considered by the majority of authors.

es -WiLeyt +"

Further courses of omalizumab, which may be adiministered in case of
relapses, show a similar profile of response, and may induce prolonged
complete remission in some cases. Upon confirmation on a larger
scale, these findings could help to optimize the cost-benefit ratio in

the use of omalizumab for the treatment of CIU.
