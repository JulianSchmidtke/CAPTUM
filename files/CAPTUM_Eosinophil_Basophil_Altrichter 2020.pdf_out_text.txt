Abstract

Background: IgG-autoantibodiesagainst the high affinity IgE-receptor,FceRla, contribute
the pathogenesis of autoimmune chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). However, it is not

known if such patients also exhibit IgM or IgA autoantibodies against FceRla.

Objectives: To develop an ELISAto assess serum levels of IgG, IgM andlgA
autoantibodies against FceRla, and to investigateif their presence is linked to clinical

features of CSU including the response to autologous serum skin testing (ASST).

Methods: Serum samples of 35 CSU patients (25 ASST-positive) and 52 healthy
controlindividuals were analyzed using a newly developed competitive ELISA for IgG,

IgM and IgAautoantibodies to FcsRla.

Results: One in four CSU patients (8/35, 24%) had elevated serum levels of IgG-antiFceRla compared with(3/52, 6%) in healthy controls. More than half of patients had IgM
(21/35, 60%) and IgA (20/35, 57%) vs (3/52, 5%) each in healthy controls. ElevatedigM,
but not IgG or IgA autoantibodies, were significantly more frequent in ASST-positive CSU
patients (18/25, 72%) compared with ASST-negative patients (3/10, 33%, P =0.022).Also,
elevated levels of IgM-anti-FceRla, but not of IgG or IgA against FceRla, were linked to
low blood basophil(r = 0.414, P = 0.021) and eosinophil(r = 0.623, P < 0.001) counts.

Conclusions: Increased serum levels of IgM-anti-FceRla are common in patients with
CSU and linked to features of autoimmune CSU. The role and relevance of
autoantibodies to FceRla in CSU can and should be further characterized in future

studies, and our novel assay can help with this.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a mast cell—driven skin disease
characterized by the recurrence of transient wheals, angioedema, or both for more than 6
weeks.' Mast cell degranulation induced via the high affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) is
considered to be one of the most frequent initiating factors in CSU.? This is evidenced by
the effectiveness of omalizumab (anti-IgE) in reducing the symptoms of the disease.? In
CSU, FceRI-dependent mast cell degranulation may occur in either of two ways. First is
Type | autoimmunity (aka autoallergy) in which a patient’s IgE is directed to
autoallergens, such as thyroid peroxidase * and interleukin-24.5: © Second is Type II
autoimmunity in which autoantibodies to IgE or FceRI, initiate mast cell activation.’”:
8Beside these well characterized mechanisms further, yet unidentified, serum derived

mast cell activation factors could be involved in the pathomechanism of CSU.%""

The initial suggestion of autoantibodies to IgE or FceRI arose more than 30 years
ago from the autologous serum skin test (ASST) in which a positive response was the
development of a wheal at the site of injection of a patient’s own serum. '? Studies by
Grattan and colleagues identified these autoantibodies of the IgG class.® 13: ‘4 More
recent studies have indicated them to be IgG, and IgG3, which are able to cause
degranulation of skin mast cells and activate complement.1518

Whether or not CSU patients exhibit IgM or IgA autoantibodies to FcsRI, is
presently unknown as immunoblotting assays with purified IgG 182° and ELISAs 5 2" for
the detection of IgG-anti-FceRI or IgG-anti-IgE are not yet well-established for other
antibodies. Althougha rapid and specific dot-blot immunoassay to detect autoantibodies
against FceRla was introduced by Lee and colleagues in 2014,72it is not available for
routine clinical use.

In this study, we aimed to develop a simple and practical, yet highly specific,
ELISA test to detect autoantibodies against FceRla in the serum of patients with CSU.
We did this fortwo reasons.First, wewished to facilitate the identification of CSU patients
with Type Ilb autoimmune urticaria by providing a test that is suitable foruse in routine

Clinical practice. Second,we wished to analyze the serum of CSU patients for IgM- and

responses, disease activity and other clinical parameters.

Methods

Patients

Serum samples and clinical information was obtained from 35 patients with CSU seen at
the Urticaria Center of Reference and Excellence (UCARE) at the Department of
Dermatology and Allergy, Charité—Universitatsmedizin Berlin.2? CSU was diagnosed and
its severity assessed according to the recent EAACI/GA7LEN/EDF/WAO guideline for
urticaria 24. Patient blood samples and data were obtained as part of their clinical
diagnostic workup, and surplus serum from clinical analyses was stored at —80°C until
used for this study. All patients provided prior informed consent on the use of left-over
serum as well as their clinical data for research purposes. As all analyses were
performed retrospectively and anonymously, additional ethics approval was not needed
or obtained. Patients had not taken systemic steroids and H,-antihistamines in the last
two weeks and three days before sampling, respectively.

The control group consisted of 52 serum samples from healthy controlswith a
negative history of chronic urticaria, autoimmune disease, or clinically relevant allergic
disease. Within this group, a sex- and age-matched healthy subgroup (n=16) was
analyzed in detail, to rule out differences due to demographics. Clinical characteristics
and demographics of all patients with CSU and healthy controls are presented in

Supplemental Table S1.

Development of an ELISA-based assay for the detection of antiFceRlaautoantibodies

An ELISA for IgM, IgG and IgA autoantibodies against FceRla was developed and used
to test sera of patients with CSU and healthy controls. Recombinant soluble FceRla
expressed from yeast (MyBiosource, San Diego, CA, USA) was coated at 50 ng/ml onto
96 well microtiter ELISA plates with 0.1 M bicarbonate buffer pH 9.6 overnight at 4°C.
The plates were blocked with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) in phosphate buffered
saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) for two hours. CSU and healthy control sera (1:100
with 10% FBS-PBST) were pre-incubated with FceRla at 100 ng/ml or with respective

volume PBST of for one hour at room temperature. Pre-incubated and mock-incubated
sera were loaded into the plates in parallel. After two hours of incubation at room
temperature, the plates were washed with PBST (0.05% Tween-20) three times, followed
by incubation with appropriately diluted AP-labelled goat-anti-human IgG, IgM or IgA
(KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) for one hour at room temperature. The plates were
washed five times prior to adding the blue phosphatase substrates for colorimetric
development and read with a wavelength of 650 nm. The reduction of signal by preincubation with FceRla was considered to indicate the presence of antibodies to FceRla
of the respective immunoglobulin group. Since those assays detect the presence of
autoantibodies (IgG, IgM, IgA) against FceRla via signal differences with and without the
pre-incubation with soluble FceRla (ratio of signal without and with FceRla), its results are
largely independent of background signals and lower ratios reflect higher levels of
autoantibodies (Supplemental Figure 1).

Selected sera were measured repetitively (ten times) to assess the intra-assay variationcoefficient (Supplemental Figure 2). The normal range of assay results was determined
by the use of healthy control sera. No significant differences between the autoantibodies
values and ranges were seen when unselected healthy controls or selected age- and
sex-matched cohorts were analyzed (Supplemental Table 1). The 95% percentile was
identified to give the best discriminative values (Supplemental Table 2) and set as the
cut-off for elevated levels of anti-FceRlaautoantibodies. The 95% percentile cut-off values
set with all healthy controls for IgM were determined at a ratio of 0.50, for IgA at 0.49,
and for IgG at 0.46.

Routine Laboratory Assessments

Routine laboratory assessments were performed in the central laboratory of the CharitéUniversitatsmedizin Berlin. Routine assessments included C-reactive protein (CRP),
complete blood count, total serum IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE, electrolyte levels (sodium,
potassium), laboratory values of the kidney (creatinine, urea) and liver (aspartate
transaminase, alanine transaminase, gamma-GT), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH),
free thyroxine (fT4), free triiodothyronine (fT3), thyroid autoantibodies (anti-TPO, antiTG), and IgG to hepatitis A, B and C. Presence of Helicobacter pylori antigen was

analyzed via PCR in the feces.

Autologous Serum Skin Test (ASST)

The ASST was performed as described previously 2°. Reactions were evaluated after 15
and 30 minutes andwheal diameter of at least 1.5 mm greater than that of the control
wheal induced by the saline solution was recorded as positive. Because a higher
prevalence of IgG-anti-FceRla was expected in ASST-positive patients, CSU patients

were preselected into 25 ASST-positive and 10 ASST-negative patients.

Assessment of urticaria activity and quality of life

Urticaria activity was assessed using the seven-day urticaria activity score (UAS7).
‘Assessment of disease control over the previous four weeks on signs and symptoms,
quality of life impairment, efficacy of treatment and overall disease control was performed
using the urticaria control test (UCT).?° ?”’Quality of life was assessed by the dermatology
life quality index (DLQI) using the validated “band descriptors” *8as follows: DLQI: 0-1 =
no effect on patient's life, 2-5 = small effect, 6-10 = moderate effect, 11-20 = very large

effect, 21-30 = extremely large effect.

Statistics

D'Agostino & Pearson omnibus normality test was used to test for normal distribution.
Parametric data are depicted using mean and standard error of mean values and nonparametric data using median and interquartile (IQR) range.Variation coefficient was
calculated for repetitive measurements. For the cut-off determination of IgA, IgM and IgG
the 0.05 percentile of the healthy population was calculated. The cut-offs assessed this
way resulted in excellent specificity and were close to expert suggestions of a cut-off of
0.5, and therefore considered best practice for the analysis.Binominal variables were
analyzed using Chi-square test. Parametric variables were compared using the unpaired
t test. Non-parametric continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney test.
Correlations between two continuous variables were calculated using Spearman's rank

correlation coefficient. P < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

CSU patients have elevated levels of IgG, IgM, and IgAautoantibodies against
FeeRla

Of 35 patients with CSU, 8 (24%) had elevated serum levels of IgG autoantibodies
against FceRla (IgG-anti-FceRla), compared with 6% of the healthy control group (P =
0.037, Table 1). Among all tested sera, IgG-anti-FceRla levels, on average, were
comparable in CSU patients and healthy subjects (CSU median 0.82 [IQR 0.48 - 1.02] vs
healthy median 0.79 [IQR 0.67 - 1.01], P = 0.661).

More than half of the CSU patients analyzed, 60% and 57%, respectively, had
elevated IgM antibodies and IgA antibodies against FceRla as compared to 5 % each of
healthy controls. The CSU patient cohort also had significantly higher average levels of
IgM-anti-FceRI and IgA-anti-FcsRI (as reflected by lower ratios) compared with healthy
controls (P < 0.001, Table 1).

Only four CSU patients (11%) did not have elevated levels of antiFceRlaautoantibodies of any subclass, and two patients (6%) were positive for all three
subclasses. Six of the eight IgG-anti-FceRla-positive patients also had elevated levels of
antibodies of other subclasses (IgM: n=3; IgA: n=5). A large proportion of CSU patients
(n=12; 35%) had both, elevated IgM and IgA antibodies against FceRla(Figure 1).

Across all sera tested (CSU patients and healthy control subjects), IgG-antiFceRla levels correlated weakly but significantly with IgA-anti-FceRla (r = 0.349, P=
0.001), but not with IgM-anti-FceRla (r = 0.066, P = 0.547). IgM-anti-FceRla and IgA-antiFceRla were also significantly correlated, albeit weakly (r = 0.375, P< 0.001).

In patients with CSU, a positive ASST is linked to elevated levels of IgM against
FceRla, but not IgG or IgA against FccRla

The analyzed CSU patient cohort contained 25 ASSTpositive (71%) and 10
ASSTnegative (29%) patients. IgG-anti-FceRla levels were elevated in four of the ASSTpositive (17%) and four of the ASST-negative (40%) patients (P = 0.154, Figure 2a). IgAanti-FceRla antibodies were elevated in about half the patients who were ASST-positive
(n = 13, 52%) and ASST-negative (n = 6, 60%, p = 0.668) (Figure 2b).In contrast, IgM
anti-FceRla were elevated significantly more often in ASST-positive patients (n = 18,

72%) compared with ASST-negative patients with CSU (n = 3, 30%; P = 0.022) (Figure
2c).

In patients with CSU, IgM against FceRla, but not IgG or IgA against FceRIa, is
linked to basopenia and eosinopenia

The presence of elevated levels of IgM-anti-FceRla, but not lgG-anti-FceRla or IgA-antiFceRla, correlated with low basophil numbers (r = 0.414, P= 0.021). IgM-anti-FceRlapositive CSU patients had significantly lower blood basophil numbers (median 0.02/nl
[IQR 0.01 - 0.03]) as compared to IgM-anti-FceRla-negative patients (median 0.22/nl
[IQR 0.13 - 0.32] P=0.0081, see Figure 3a).

The presence of elevated levels of IgM-anti-FceRla also showed a clear
correlation with the patients’ eosinophil numbers (r = 0.623, P< 0.001). Again, IgM-antiFceRla-positive CSU patients had significantly lower absolute eosinophil numbers
(median 0.11/nl [IQR 0.04 - 0.15]) compared with IgM-anti-FceRla-negative patients
(median 0.2/nl [IQR 0.12 - 0.32] P = 0.0016; see Figure 3b). The presence of elevated
levels of IgG-anti-FceRla or IgA-anti-FceRla was not linked to eosinopenia, and patients
who were positive for these autoantibodies did not have reduced blood eosinophil
numbers as compared to patients who were not (data not shown).

A weak, but significant correlation of IgM-anti-FceRla-positivity, but not IgG-antiFceRla-positivity or IgA-anti-FceRla-positivity, was also seen with lymphocyte numbers (r
= 0.38, P = 0.028).

Indicators of disease activity (UAS7), disease control (UCT) or quality of life
(DLQI) in our CSU patient cohort were not significantly different or correlated with any of
the anti-FceRla subclasses tested. There were also no difference or link to other cells
assessed in the blood count, electrolyte levels, CRP levels, kidney or liver markers,
thyroid hormones or thyroid autoantibodies or total IgE. Furthermore, IgG, IgM and IgA
autoantibodies against FceRla were not correlated with total serum IgG, IgM and IgA

levels, respectively.

Discussion

In this study, we present a new method for the detection of autoantibodies against
FceeRla. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that CSU patients, in addition to
having IgG autoantibodies, have IgM and IgA autoantibodies against FceRla. This new
ELISA-based test is inexpensive and easy to perform, suitable for high through-put
routine analysis. The assay has proved to be robust in repetitive measurements and
circumvents the common problem of serum background signals, by using specific
competitive signal inhibition by soluble FceRla pre-incubation.

IgG autoantibodies against FceRlawere first described in patients with CSU more
than 20 years ago '8. Despite this, no routine testing of these autoantibodies is currently
available. Some of the methods used require IgG purification of the serum before
detecting via Western blot techniques 18: 19: 29-33, which is time-consuming. Using our
newly developed ELISA, the prevalence of elevated levels of IgG autoantibodies against
FceRlawas 24% in the analyzed CSU patient sera. These results are in line with many
other reports in the literature where rates of 25% up to 52% had been reported in CSU
patients 18, 19, 29-33 |

More interestingly, the majority of our analyzed sera also contained elevated levels
of IgM (60%) and IgA autoantibodies (57%) to FceRla. Little is known about the
prevalence and function of IgM and IgA autoantibodies in patients with CSU. Gruber et al.
34 analyzed the prevalence of IgG and IgM autoantibodies directed against IgE in distinct
subsets of urticaria, namely CSU and cold urticaria as well as urticaria vasculitis. IgGanti-IgE antibodies were found in 50% of patients with CSU, in 55% of patients with cold
urticaria, and in 50% of patients with urticarial vasculitis. IgM-anti-IgE antibodies with
histamine-releasing activity were found exclusively in cold urticaria (22%), but not in
patients with CSU.

The ASST is a well-established test to investigate serum autoreactivity in patients
with CSU * and has been associated with IgG antibodies against the FceRla or against
IgE (Type Ilb autoimmunity) ” 9°. Also, basophil activation tests and basophil histamine
release tests have been shown to be a good surrogate marker for autoimmunity in CSU ’,
but are not commonly available as routine analysis and had not been assessed in this
study cohort. Surprisingly, in our cohort, ASST-positive patients did not show a higher

rate of elevated levels of IgG to FceRlacompared with ASST-negative patients. This

finding is somewhat contradictory those of other groups, who reported up to 6-fold higher
rates of IgG autoantibodies to FcsRlain ASST-positive patients compared to ASSTnegative CSU patients 29 3°. However, our cohort had overall small numbers, especially in
the ASST-negative CSU patient group, which limits the interpretation of our results.
Furthermore, other studies used different methods for IgG antibody detection, which
might explain, in part, the large differences reported among different studies. In previous
reports it had been shown that the IgG autoantibodies in urticaria patients belong
predominately to the IgG1 and IgG3 subtype and, to a lesser extent, IgG4'® 3”, who have
complement fixing and basophil activation abilities. Asero and colleagues has shown that
>100kDa serum fractions (that include IgG) are able to degranulate basophils and that at
least in some cases complement seems essential for histamine-releasing activity of
serum from patients with CIU%®. In our study we have not further discriminated the IgG
subtypes or complement fixation ability.

One of the most interesting findings of our study is that elevated levels of IgM-antiFceRla are markedly more common in ASST positive patients (72%) compared with
ASST negative patients (30%) (Figure 2b).

Antibodies involved in autoimmunity usually belong to the IgG and IgM
subclasses. In CSU, Grattan et a/. showed that the IgM fraction of three CSU sera led to
some histamine release from healthy donor basophils, but the specificity of these IgM
antibodies remains elusive®. To our knowledge, there are no identified IgM
autoantibodies with known specificity in patients with CSU in the literature. As IgG
autoantibodies to IgE or to FceRla exist in CSU, the presence of IgM autoantibodies to
IgE or to FceRIa is feasible and could play a significant role in the pathogenesis of CSU.
Their presence might explain ASST reactivity in IgG-anti-FceRla and IgG-anti-IgE
negative CSU patients, especially as there were only a few patients (n=3) who were
double positive for IgG and IgM autoantibodies.Specific IgM is thought to precede IgG
formation®°and thus, IgM positive CSU patients might become IgG positive in the course
of their disease. Longitudinal studies following CSU patients over longer time periods
assessing IgG or other autoantibodies are currently missing.

Additionally, IgA autoantibodies to FceRla were also frequently elevated (57%) in

our CSU cohort. Of note, all of the 4 patients in our cohort who tested positive for

Helicobacter antigen displayed IgA autoantibodies (data not shown), and five out of eight
IgA positive patients had IgG antibodies against hepatitis A, but none of the seven IgA
negative patients, whose serological hepatitis were available (Fisher exact; P = 0.007),
indicating that present or past gastrointestinal or mucosal associated infections could be
a trigger for the development of IgA autoantibodies. These autoantibodies showed a
correlation with IgM autoantibodies, and more than one third (35%) of the CSU patients
were double positive for both autoantibodies. In contrast to the IgM autoantibody titers,
there was no significant difference between the ASST positive and negative CSU patient
cohorts (Fig. 2c)

FcsRla is not only expressed on mast cells, but also on basophils 4° and in some
inflammatory diseases, also on eosinophils.*': 42 In CSU, basopenia has been shown to
be correlated with disease activity and is restored upon successful treatment with
omalizumab.*?: 44 In a subgroup of CSU patients, eosinopenia can also be observed.*5
Serum-induced basophil activation, which can be observed with many CSU sera
samples, is thought to be due to autoantibodies against IgE or FceRla, leading to
basopenia “°. In our study, IgM, but not IgG autoantibodies against FceRla, were
significantly correlated with basopenia and eosinopenia. IgM, like some IgG subclasses,
is a complement fixing antibody that can directly activate the complement system with
subsequent cell destruction,*” possibly leading to the observed low cell count.

In our CSU patient cohort, the presence of autoantibodies of any class was not
associated with higher disease activity, disease burden or less disease control. It has
been reported that the presence of IgG autoantibodies against FceRIa is linked to more
severe symptoms and a poor response to conventional antihistamine therapy, as well as
a slower response to anti-IgE treatment.’ 2° 48 In a large multicenter trial using this new
assay for IgG-anti-FceRla determination, along with many other autoimmune markers,
higher UAS7 scores in autoimmune type II CSU patients were seen, but not in other
scorings.’ We cannot explainwhy we did not see this correlation in our study but the small
sample size or the preselection of patients may have been relevant. Of note, there was
also no correlation with the total serum IgG, IgM or IgA values, which strengthens the

idea that the detected autoantibodies are rather specific.

The overall limitations of this study are the retrospective analysis and the limited
number of preselected patients from a specialized tertiary care center. Nevertheless, we
were able to demonstrate, for the first-time, the presence of new immunoglobulin class
antibodies against FceRla and the association with autoimmune disease features. Further
limitations are given by the fact that this test assesses the occurrence of the
autoantibodies, but does not directly answer the question of functional relevance of these
autoantibodies. Here further studies are needed to prove this.

In conclusion, this study reports a new and easy method for the detection of IgG,
IgM, and IgA autoantibodies against FceRla. Elevated levels of IgM and IgA class
autoantibodies against FceRla were more frequent than those of IgG. The detection of
these new autoantibody classes in CSU and, in the case of IgM, the association with
Clinical features such as the ASST and basopenia adds to our understanding of the role

of autoantibodies in CSU.

Table 1: Patients with CSU more frequently display elevated levels of autoantibodies of different subclasses
against FceRlIa. For IgG-anti-FceRI, IgM-anti-FceRI, and IgA anti-FceRI (all assessed by the use of a
competitive ELISA), subjects with values below the cut-off of 0.46, 0.59 and 0.49 were considered positive,
respectively. Rates of patients or healthy controls with elevated autoantibody levels, i.e. values below the
cut-off, are given in the upper panel, median and interquartile ranges of ratios are shown in the lower panel

of each Ig subclass.

Figure 1: Venn diagram of co-occurrence of anti-FceRIa antibodies of the three different

subclasses. Numbers in the graph give the number of single, double or triple positive CS.

Figure 2: Autoantibodies to FceRIa in the ASST positive (n = 24) and ASST negative (n = 10)
CSU patient subgroups. All three panels of this figure show ratios of individual patients (every dot
represents one patient). Low ratios reflect high autoantibody titers. In addition, median and
interquartile ranges are shown for the ASST subgroups for a) IgG-anti-FceRIa, b) IgA antiFceeRIa, c) IgM-anti-FceRla. Cut-offs of the individual assays are depicted as dotted line and areas

of elevated levels are depicted in light gray.

Figure 3: The presence of elevated levels of IgM antibodies against FceRIais linked to low
basophil (3a) and eosinophil numbers (3b). Ratios of individual patients are displayed as dots,
median and interquartile ranges are shown for the anti- FceRIa IgM positive (n = 20) and negative

subgroups (n = 11).
