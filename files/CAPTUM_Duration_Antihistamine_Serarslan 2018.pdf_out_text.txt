Abstract

Antihistamines are the first-line treatment option for chronic urticaria. In recent years,
omalizumab, an anti-immunoglobulin-E humanized monoclonal antibody, has been used in
patients with recalcitrant disease. This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy
and safety of omalizumab and determine whether there was a difference between complete
and partial responses to omalizumab with respect to age, gender, disease duration and
coexistence of angioedema. From May 2014 to December 2016, a total of 40 refractory
chronic urticaria patients were treated with omalizumab. Complete response was observed in
19 (47.5%) patients, and partial response was observed in 18 (45%) patients. There were no
statistically significant differences between the rates of complete and partial responses in
patients with respect to gender, age and disease duration. However, complete response was
more frequent (60%) in patients without angioedema. Remission was observed in 40.5%
n=15) of patients, and the follow-up time was 5.5+2.4 months. There was a statistically
significant association between remission and coexistence of angioedema (p<0.05). Eightyseven percent (13/15) of the remission patients did not have angioedema. Thus, omalizumab
can be used effectively and safely in refractory chronic urticaria patients. However, the
coexistence of angioedema may be an unfarovable factor for complete response and

remission.

Introduction

Chronic urticaria is characterized by pruritic wheals, that recur or last for >6 weeks. Recently,
the term ‘chronic spontaneous urticaria’ (CSU) has been used instead of ‘chronic idiopathic
urticaria’ and ‘chronic autoimmune urticaria’. Second-generation H1-antihistamines are the
first-line medications in CSU treatment, with a dose increase if patients are unresponsive to
the treatment (Song, Stern, Giruparajah, Berlin, & Sussman, 2013). Omalizumab is a
recombinant humanized IgGl monoclonal antibody that selectively binds free
immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. Circulating IgE binds the high-affinity (FceRI) and low
affinity (FceRI, CD23) receptors on basophils and mast cells, resulting in the release of
histamine and other mediators of the allergic response. Omalizumab binds the high-affinity
receptor-binding domain (Ce3) on the Fe portion of free IgE (Chia, & Mydlarski R., 2016).
Omalizumab has recently been approved for the treatment of refractory chronic urticaria.

The aim of this retrospective observational study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety

of omalizumab and the follow-up results in Turkish patients with CSU.
Material and Methods

Records of patients with CSU treated with omalizumab at the Department of Dermatology,
Mustafa Kemal University, Hatay, Turkey between May 2014 and December 2016 were
retreived in this retrospective study. Clinical diagnosis had been made based on the clinical
symptoms and patient’s history. Biopsy had been performed in a few patients to rule out
rticarial vasculitis. Demographic data and clinical variables such as age, gender, duration of
disease, prior treatments, comorbidities, and the presence of angioedema (AE) were recorded.
This retrospective study was approved by the Ethics Commitee of Mustafa Kemal University
(Hatay, Turkey).

Definitions

Indications for omalizumab treatment Patients unresponsive to antihistamines, despite dose

incriments and the use of medications such as cyclosporine, corticosteroids and montelukast.

Omalizumab treatment protocol Once a month, 300 mg, subcutaneously. Omalizumab was

stopped every 6 months. If symptoms recurred, treatment was restarted.

Response to Omalizumab Clinical response to treatment was evaluated monthly according to

the symptoms in patients and the need for additional antihistamine drugs. If urticaria attacks

were improved, patients were recommended to stop additional medications in the first
months of treatment.
-Complete response (CR): Complete resolution of symptoms without adding medications

other than omalizumab.

-Partial response (PR): Resolution or improvement of symptoms with the addition of
antihistamines (Armengot-Carbo, Velasco-Pastor, Rodrigo-Nicolas, Pont-Sanjuan, Quecedo
Estebanez, & Gimeno-Carpio, 2013).
Duration of relapse From the last omalizumab injection until recurrence of an urticaria attack.
Statistical analysis

Data were analysed using SPSS for Windows (version 19; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A

chi-squared test, Fisher’s exact test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for statistical

 

analysis. Values are presented as the mean +SD or median, and p<0.05 was considered

significant.
Results

A total of 40 CSU patients (19 females, 21 males) treated with omalizumab were enrolled in

 

this retrospective study. The mean age was 43.1+12.1 years (range, 19-76 years), and the

 

duration of disease was 56.8+63.6 months (range, 5-264 months; median, 36 months). AE
was present concomitantly in 30% (n=12) of the patients. Demographic and clinical

haracteristics and previous treatments of the patients are displayed in Table 1.

Omalizumab was discontinued because of treatment failure in three patients (7.5%). Two of
the patients received 3 and one received 5 doses of omalizumab. The rest of the patients
received 5-23 injections. CR was observed in 47.5% (n=19) of the patients, and PR was
observed in 45% (n=18) of the patients. There were no statistically significant differences
between the rates of CR and PR with respect to gender (p=0.254) and age (p=0.761). There
was no Statistically significant difference between the CR (median, 48 months; range, 5-264
months) and PR (median, 30 months; range, 12-264 months) groups with respect to the
disease duration either (p=0.702). However, the disease duration was much longer in the
patients with CR. No statistically significant difference was detected between these two

groups regarding the coexistence of AE (p=0.129). However, CR was more frequent (60%,

n=15) in the patients without AE (Table 2). Unresponsive patients (n=3) were not included in

the statistical analysis because of the low number of patients.

Remission was observed in 40.5% (n=15) of patients, and these patients received 3-9
omalizumab injections. The follow-up time was 3-10 months. Only five of these patients
received antihistamines after the cessation of omalizumab, three for pruritus and two for
infrequent urticarial symptoms. There was a statistically significant correlation between
remission and the presence of AE (p=0.043; p<0.05). Eighty-seven percent (13/15) of the
remission patients did not have AE (Table 3). We did not detect a statistically significant
association between remission and the gender (p=0.942), disease duration (p=0.297) and age
(p=0.111).

Recurrence of urticaria attacks occured in 30-90 days (n=20) at the end of the first 6-month
period, 30-70 days (n=8) at the end of the 2"! 6-month period, and 45-180 days (n=4) at the
end of the 3" 6-month period in the CR and PR patients. The duration of recurrence was
similar in every period. Only one patient was asymptomatic for 180 days after the end of the

3" 6-month period.

Reversable adverse effects of omalizumab were observed in two patients (5%). One had an

injection site reaction, and the other had palpitations.
Discussion

n this retrospective study, we detected a statistically significant association between
remission and the absence of AE. Although the difference was not statistically significant, CR
was more frequent (60%, n=15) in patients without AE. Similarly, Ghazanfar et al. have
reported that complete responders were more frequent among patients without AE and AE
was not included as a predictor of a favorable response to treatment (Ghazanfar, Sand, &

Thomsen, 2016).

CR and PR rates were 47.5% and 45% respectively, in our study. Recurrence of symptoms
started just before the next omalizumab injection in patients with PR (generally, 10 days or 1
week before). In a few studies, CR has been defined as complete resolution of symptoms
without adding drugs other than omalizumab, similar to our study. Rottem et al. have reported
that the incidence of CR was 57% and that of PR was 43% (Rottem et al. 2014). Labrador et
al. have reported that 60% of patients could stop concomitant medications and remain

asymptomatic with omalizumab alone (Labrador-Horrillo et al., 2013). In another

retrospective study, the authors have reported that 83% of patients were complete responders
(Metz, Ohanyan, Church, & Maurer, 2014). The CR rate was lower in our study than in other
studies, which could be explained by differences in study designs.

Remission was observed in 40.5% of patients in our study. Remission rates have been
different in other retrospective studies. In one retrospective study, omalizumab was stopped in
37.3% of patients with CR; however, in 47.5% of those, omalizumab was restarted because of
recurrence (Labrador-Horrillo et al., 2013). Song et al. have reported that of the 14 patients
(88%) who initially benefited, 4 remained in remission for more than 9 months after their last
treatment (Song, Stern, Giruparajah, Berlin, & Sussman, 2013). Ghazanfar et al. have reported

that their remission were 7% (Ghazanfar, Sand, & Thomsen, 2016).

In conclusion, the remission rate was higher in our study than that in other studies. The
follow-up time was 3-9 months in our study. However, a longer follow-up duration can alter
the rate of remission. We also detected that the presence of AE was an unfavorable factor for

remission and CR. Therefore, CSU patients with AE may need longer treatment.
