Abstract

Introduction: Some previous studies reported autoimmunity as an etiologic factor in chronic urticaria (CU), but the
results of some autoimmunity tests in these studies are conflicting.

Aim: To concretize whether there was any relation of autologous serum skin test (ASST) and autologous plasma
skin test (APST) results with sex, age and urticarial activity score (UAS) in patients with CU.

Material and methods: Fifty patients with CU and twenty healthy subjects admitted to our dermatology clinic were
included in the present study. The ASST and APST were applied to all individuals.

Results: The positiveness rates of ASST and APST were significantly higher in the patient group than controls
(p = 0.027, p = 0.001, respectively). Among patients, the APST positiveness rate (72%) was significantly (p < 0.05)
higher than ASST (46%). It was seen that 48% of patients with negative ASST results had positive APST. However,
no patient with negative APST results had positive ASST. There were significant (p < 0.05) relations of the tests’
positiveness rates with sex and old age but with UAS. The diameter of the erythematous papule was remarkably
(p < 0.05) larger in APST than ASST and also significantly (p < 0.05) larger in females compared to males in both
tests (p < 0.05). It was positively increased with old age (p < 0.05).

Conclusions: We can suggest that APST is more sensitive than ASST in the assessment of autoimmunity in CU.
A high positiveness rate of APST results may be attributed to high numbers of autoantibodies and coagulation
factors present in plasma that might probably play a role in etiopathogenesis of CU.

 

Key words: chronic urticaria, autoimmunity, autologous serum skin test, autologous plasma skin test.

Introduction In recent years, autoimmunity has been reported as

an etiologic factor in 40-60% of CIU cases [3]. IgG type
autoantibodies that are developed against an a subunit

Urticaria is a frequently seen vascular reaction of skin
and mucosa. It is characterized by transient erythema
tous and edematous as well as raised skin plaques.
Acute urticaria is usually seen in young patients, whereas
chronic urticaria (CU) is commonly seen in middle-aged
women. If urticaria lasts more than 6 weeks, it is classified as CU [1]. Chronic urticaria is divided into two
groups: 1) chronic autoimmune urticaria (CAU) (45%);
and 2) chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) (55%) [2].

of the high affinity IgE receptors in mast cells and basophiles were detected in 15-31% of the cases [4]. The
positiveness rate of this autoantibody was detected in
around 37-60% among CU cases in different studies [5,
6]. It was shown that autoantibodies that are developed
against FceRla and IgE were IgG1 and |gG3 isotypes [7].
These aforementioned cases were named as CAU.

The autoantibodies were shown to trigger histamine
release of basophiles (from a healthy donor) and mast
cells in vitro [4, 8]. The gold standard test for the funcional autoantibodies in CAU is a basophil histamine
release test. However, due to difficulties in standardizaion and a prolonged duration of the test, it is usually
used for advanced researches. Another diagnostic test
or CAU is an autologous serum skin test (ASST). Application of this test is simple, easier, cheaper, and more
accurate than the basophil histamine release test. An
in vivo test ASST is analogous of in vitro basophil hisamine release test and it is based on formation of eryhema and swelling after intradermal autologous serum
injection [7]. This test was the first observation to help
us define antibodies in circulating blood [9]. The simple
observation shows that histamine releasing factors are
resent in the patients’ serum that may be related to the
resence of functional anti-FceRla and anti IgE antibodies in CAU [4, 5, 10]. The ASST is a simple method for the
diagnosis of autoreactive CU, but it can cause false positive results, which is related to the formation of a large
amount of bradykinin and secretion of tryptases from
neutrophils during the coagulation process [11, 12]. In
a double blind placebo controlled study it was shown
that warfarin (an anticoagulation medication) provided
a remarkable response in anti-histamine resistant CU
cases [13].

In a previous study, presence of antibodies, coagulation factors and some other proteins were reported to be
higher in the plasma than serum [14, 15]. Plasma thrombin production increases endothelial cell permeability
and may lead to activation of mast cells and extrinsic
coagulation pathway in CU. Increased tissue factors were
shown in skin biopsies of CU patients [11]. Some factors
occurring in the course of coagulation may cause false
positive results of ASST, thus the specificity of ASST has
been controversial in the diagnosis of CAU [7, 16]. Therefore, it has been recently suggested that APST may be
more sensitive than ASST [17]. Heparin can inhibit in vivo
and in vitro degranulation of mast cells and basophiles,
so if plasma is anti-coagulated with heparin, it cannot be
used for APST [18, 19]. Thus plasma that was anti-coagulated with sodium citrate was used for APST.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Aim

n this study, we aimed to concretize whether there
was a relation of APST and ASST results of CU patients
with age, sex and urticarial activity score (UAS) because
the results of a few previous studies in this regard were
conflicting.

and had chronic or recurrent urticaria with or without
angioedema for at least 6 weeks were enrolled in our
study (18 male and 32 female; mean + SD age 29.72 +8.52
years, range: 16-51). Twenty healthy individuals were selected as control subjects (8 males and 12 females; mean
+ SD age 26.40 +8.27 years, range: 15-43). These control
subjects had no history of urticaria, allergic and autoimmune diseases and psychiatric treatment. In addition,
patients who had physical urticaria and urticaria continued for less than 6 weeks as well as who used urticaria
induced drugs or immunosuppressive drugs within last
3 months were excluded from the study. We defined UAS
of the subjects. An informed consent form was obtained
from all subjects, and the study was conducted based
on the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The study was
approved by the local ethics committee and conducted
according to the ethical principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki.

 

Application of Autologous Serum and Plasma Skin
Tests

Tests (ASST and APST) were applied on the flexor
surfaces of both forearms of patients with CU and the
controls. Antihistaminic drugs were stopped at least
3 days and mast cell stabilizers were stopped at least
7 days before the tests. Totally, a 5 ml sample of venous
blood was collected from each subject. Two ml of blood
were taken in a tube with sodium citrate and the rest in
a biochemistry tube. After 30 min in room temperature,
the samples were centrifuged (Jouanbrand CR4i, France)
with 4000 rpm for 7 min and then serum and plasma
were taken.

Autologous plasma, undiluted autologous serum, and
0.9% saline were taken with separate insulin syringes
(0.1. cc from each solution) and were applied on the flexor
surfaces of both forearms. The injections were applied on
the areas that did not have any urticarial papules within
last 24 h. There was at least 5 cm distance between the
injection areas. The results were assessed 30 min after
the application. When the diameter of the erythematous
papule formed by autologous serum or plasma was at
least 1.5 mm larger than the control area where 0.9%
saline was administered, the response was accepted as
positive. The diameter was measured by a digital caliper.
Before applying the tests, adrenaline, injectable prednisolone, and antihistamines were prepared ready for a possible anaphylactic reaction. The tests were applied by one
researcher and the results were interpreted by another
researcher.

 

 

Assessment of Urticarial Activity Score

The severity of disease was assessed by UAS as recommended by the EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF guidelines [20].
UAS was calculated as the sum of the score values for

the number of wheals and pruritus intensity. The total
score ranges from 0 to 6.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics for studied variables (characteristics) were presented as mean, standard deviation,
minimum and maximum values. In addition, categorical
variables were described with the number and percentage. Student t test was used to compare control and patient groups’ means for the studied continuous variables.
For determination of linear relationships among these
variables, Pearson correlation analysis was carried out.
Furthermore, the y? test was utilized for determination
of the relationships between categorical variables. Statistical significance levels were considered as 5% and SPSS
(ver. 13) statistical program was used for all statistica
computations.

 

 

 

Results

Sex, age and test results of the patient and contro
groups are summarized in Table 1. The positiveness rates
of ASST and APST were significantly higher in the patien
group than controls (p = 0.027, p = 0.001, respectively).
As shown in Table 2, the positiveness rates of ASST an
APST increased with old age (p = 0.028, p = 0.027, respectively) and were remarkably higher in female subjects (p = 0.001 for ASST, p = 0.032 for APST). Twenty
three patients (46%) had positive ASST and 36 (72%)
had positive APST. The positiveness rate of APST was determined to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than ASST

were examined, it was seen that 48% of them had positive APST results. However, all the patients with negative
APST results had also negative ASST results. As seen in

Discussion

In this study, we investigated possible relations of
ASST and APST results with sex, age and UAS in patients
with CU. In some previous studies, urticaria was informed
to be seen two times more frequently in women than
men [21]. In accordance with these data, 64% of the subjects were women and 36% of them were men in the
patient group of our study. Chronic urticaria is frequently
seen in middle-aged patients, particularly in the 3 and
4“ decades [22, 23]. The mean age of patients with CU
was 29.72 +8.525 years in our study. The mean duration
of CU was around 3 years in the present study while it
was reported to be 4 years in Metz et al.’s study [22]. We
did not find any relations of age or disease duration with
both sexes.

The ASST shows presence of functional autoantibodies in CU [4, 24]. There is a discrepancy in its reported
results with some earlier studies. Grattan et al. [25] in
which ASST was applied for the first time to patients with
CU reported 58% of positive results. The positiveness rate
of ASST was found to be 60% in a study of Niimi et al.
26] while 17% in Harmanyeri et al. [24] and 40% in Hizal et al. [27]. With regard to our study, this rate of ASST
was 46%. We measured the diameter of erythematous
papules with a digital caliper in accordance with studies
of Sabroe et al. [4] and Harmanyeri et al. [24]. The results
were accepted as positive when the erythematous diameter was at least 1.5 mm larger in ASST compared to the
control area where 0.9% saline was administered.

In the present study, we included 20 healthy subjects
in the control group. Positiveness rates of APST and ASST
were the same (15%) in this group. Apart from our study,
Alpay et al. [28] and Yildiz et al. [14] found positiveness
rates in the control group as 10% and 30%, respectively.
In our study, the diameter of erythematous papules of
ASST and APST were remarkably higher in female patients than males and there was a positive relation of this

diameter with old age. In contrast to our study, Aytekin et
al. [29] suggested a significant increment of ASST positivity with young age and no remarkable relationship was
reported between this positivity and sex in that study.
Kocatiirk et al. [30] showed no remarkable difference of
ASST and APST test results with age, sex, disease duration, UAS and presence of angioedema or other autoimmune diseases in patients with CU. We applied foregoing
tests on both forearms of subjects for the first time in
the literature. However, we could not find any remarkable
difference between the right and left forearms.

In the patient group of our study, ASST and APST positiveness rates were 46% and 72%, respectively. When
patients who had negative ASST results were evaluated,
it was seen that 48% of them had positive APST results.
However, all the patients with negative APST results had
also negative ASST results. In a study of Asero et al. [11]
which was conducted on 96 patients with CU, ASST and
APST tests were compared. The positiveness rate of ASST
was 53% and APST was 86%. In another recent study
conducted on 200 patients with CU, ASST and APST positiveness rates were 37.5% and 43%, respectively and
23.2% of patients with negative ASST results had positive
APST [22]. Unlike the results of our study, Kocattirk et al.
30] reported a higher ASST positiveness rate (62.9%)
than APST (38.6%). However, Alpay et al. [28] and Yildiz
et al. [14] reported approximately equal results of APST
and ASST positiveness rates. Our current results are consistent with Asero et al. [11] and Metz et al. [22] in which
igher numbers of patients were evaluated. These results
suggest that APST is more sensitive than ASST.
According to the results of the current study, the
diameter of the erythematous papule was remarkably
arger in APST than ASST and also significantly larger in
emales compared to males in both tests. Our bigger result of the diameter in APST comparing to ASST was also
reported in Godse [23]. However, Asero et al. [11] reported
a slightly larger diameter of APST than ASST. A larger diameter of APST detected in our study may have resulted
from coagulation factors or high rate autoantibodies in
plasma.

Generally, the severity of urticaria is assessed by UAS
as recommended by the EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF guidelines
[20]. Urticarial activity score was reported to be signifi

cantly higher in patients with positive ASST results than
patients with negative ASST in a study of Metz et al. [22].
However, there was no statistically significant difference
in UAS between patients with APST positive and negative results in that study. With regard to our current trial,
there was no remarkable difference of UAS between the
patients with positive and negative ASST results in line
with Kocattirk et al. [30]. We found similar results between UAS and APST.
n the present trial, duration of CU was detected to
be unrelated to ASST and APST results. In line with our
study, Hizal et al. [27] and Kocattirk et al. [30] did not
find any significant differences in the duration of disease between ASST positive and negative groups. Unlike
these foregoing studies, Grattan et al. [25] showed that
patients with positive ASST results had shorter duration
of disease than the patients with negative ASST results.
nthe recent years, it has been asserted that thrombocyte-derived factors and other coagulation factors may
play an important role in skin reactions and pathogenesis
of CU [11]. Complement cascades were observed to have
an important role in mast cells degranulation [31]. Asero
et al. [32] showed that the levels of D-dimer, F, ,, and FVII
were significantly higher in the CU patients with active
lesions than the healthy subjects. Yildiz et al. [14] also
reported similar results. These findings suggested that
the external coagulation system might be active in patients with CU. The last product of intrinsic and extrinsic
coagulation systems is thrombin. Thrombin may induce
C5a (anaphylatoxin) production, permeability of vessels,
mast cells activation and degranulation [19, 33]. Thus, it
as been suggested that thrombin might play an active
role in the pathogenesis of CU [34]. Acute angioedema
attacks were associated with the excessive thrombin
roduction either in hereditary or acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency [11]. Coagulation factors, autoantibodies,
and histamine releasing factors are present in plasma.
However, no coagulation factors are present in serum.
Therefore, coagulation factors induced skin reaction
cannot be seen in ASST and this case may cause false
negative results [14]. Due to the presence of coagulation
actors in plasma, APST provides more information on
the pathogenesis of urticaria. Moreover, an earlier study
which found warfarin to be effective in treatment of CU
(antihistaminic drug resistant) supported foregoing roles
of coagulation factors in CU [13].

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Conclusions

The APST positiveness results of patients with CU
were remarkably higher than ASST. In addition, 48% of
the patients with negative ASST results had positive
APST indicating the roles of coagulation factors and high
antibody content of plasma in the etiopathogenesis of
CU. Moreover, we found a remarkably larger diameter
of the erythematous papule in APST than ASST in both

Postepy Dermatologii i Alergologii 3, June / 2015

sexes. High positiveness rates of tests and the larger
diameter in females may be attributed to high rates o
autoimmune diseases seen in women. Therefore, in order to evaluate autoimmunity of CU, APST can be more
sensitive than ASST. Further studies investigating anticoagulant medications in the treatment of CU are needed
to enlighten our current findings.
