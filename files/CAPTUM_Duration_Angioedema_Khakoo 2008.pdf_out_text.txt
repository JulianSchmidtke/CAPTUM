Physical triggers are the most common precipitating factors for chronic
urticaria in childhood. We investigate the natural history of physical
urticaria (PU) and attempt to identify prognostic features. A retrospective study covering a 3 yr period (1999-2002) identified 82 children
with PU seen in a tertiary referral centre. Parents of 53 children with PU
responded to follow up by questionnaire and were included in the data
analysis. The questionnaire ascertained symptom severity, remission
status, effects of treatment and prognostic factors in determining resolution of the urticaria. Not all parents answered every question. Fisher’s
exact test was used to compare the remission and non-remission groups
and Kaplan—Meir survival analysis was used to derive estimates of time
to achieve remission. All 53 children with PU had chronic urticaria,
with dermatographic, cholinergic and mixed subtypes of PU forming
over 70% of the subtypes. Overall, 13% (6/45) of the children reported
respiratory symptoms with the episodes of urticaria, and 67% (35/52)
reported associated angioedema. In univariate analysis, a history of
other allergic conditions in the child was associated with a greater
chance of non-remission (p = 0.007). No significant difference in the
age of onset of urticaria and duration of individual bouts was noted
between the remission and non-remission groups. Episodes of urticaria
were significantly less frequent (p = 0.02) in the remission group
(monthly/weekly/daily — 70% /30%/0%) than the non-remission group
(38% /34%/28%). Among the 20 children achieving remission, on
average this occurred 30 months after onset of symptoms. In the survival analysis, the number of children becoming urticaria free was
11.6% (95% CI: 5.4%-23.9%) at 1 yr post-onset and 38.4% (95% CI:
25.9%-54.3%) 5 yr post-onset. In conclusion, based on this selected
tertiary population, the prognosis for PU may not be as benign as has
previously been reported. A history of allergic conditions and more
frequent episodes of urticaria were associated with a poorer prognosis.

Chronic urticaria, defined as urticaria lasting
onger than 6 wk, affects 0.1-0.3% of children in
he UK. Physical urticaria (PU) has been
reported as the cause of 6-17% of chronic
urticaria (1). PU is divided into several subtypes
with dermatographic urticaria being the commonest form of PU in children and adults — in
some pediatric studies accounting for up to 24%
of the sample (Table 1) (2-5).

 

There is very limited literature regarding the
natural history of PU, and most relates to the
adult population (3). A search of PubMed up to
2006 revealed 19 publications since 1983, only five
of which included any pediatric data (1, 3, 6-8).

The aim of the current study is to investigate
the natural history of PU in a pediatric population seen in a tertiary referral pediatric allergy
clinic. The different subtypes of PU and their

prevalence are assessed, as is the age of onset
and, if applicable, resolution. Data relating to
frequency of the episodes and associated symptoms are also presented. Prognostic factors for
remission vs. non-remission are analyzed.

Subjects and Methods

The study was carried out at the Department of
Pediatric Allergy, Asthma and Immunology at St
Mary’s Hospital, London, a tertiary referral
centre serving West London and surrounding
areas. The Department patient database was
searched retrospectively for patients over a 3 yr
period (September 1999 to August 2002), using a
number of keywords to identify the cases (i.e.,
PU, names of subtypes, chronic urticaria). The
relevant medical records were then reviewed to
confirm the diagnosis of PU. Follow-up data was
obtained using a questionnaire sent out between
January and March 2003.

Our search identified a total number of 410
cases diagnosed with all types of urticaria during
the study period. A total of 82 patients with PU
were finally identified. Only patients with urticaria solely generated by physical stimuli were
included. All patients were sent a questionnaire
with specific questions referring to the condition’s
progress. The parents of these children were
asked about the presence and nature of symptoms, age of onset and, where applicable, age of
resolution. Other questions aimed to reveal the
frequency of the episodes, their average duration,
treatment, and the presence of any associated
swelling or difficulty in breathing. Finally, the
parents were questioned regarding any first
degree family history of allergy or allergies in
the affected child (asthma, eczema, perennial
rhinitis, hay fever, pet allergy, food allergy). The
data were analyzed using STATA 8 (9).

Results

There were 53 respondents (M:F 25:28), a
response rate of 65%. Not all respondents

364

answered every question. There were no significant demographic differences between the questionnaire responders and the 29 non-responders.

The subtypes of PU reported were as follows:

dermatographic (n = 20, 38%), cholinergic
(n = 10, 19%), mixed physical subtypes
(n = 9, 17%), pressure (n = 5, 9%), cold

(n = 5, 9%), heat (n = 1, 2%), unspecified
(n = 2, 4%) and subtype not declared (n = 1,
2%). Among the mixed group, the combination
of cholinergic and dermatographic urticaria was
the commonest.

All children exhibited chronic urticaria as their
symptoms lasted for more than 6 wk. In 35 out
of 52 patients (67%) there was associated
angioedema during the urticarial episodes. The
frequency of respiratory symptoms during bouts
of urticaria was low, comprising only six out of
45 patients (13%).

For the purposes of the survival analysis, the
cohort was divided into ‘remission’ and ‘nonremission’ groups, with remission being defined
as the absence of any urticaria for at least three
consecutive months and until the time of follow
up. At the time the study was performed, the
condition had resolved in 38% of the patients
(n = 20, M:F 13:7). The profiles of the remission
group and non-remission group are summarized
in Table 2. No statistically significant differences
were found in the age of onset and duration of
bouts between the remission and non-remission
groups. However, the increased frequency of
exacerbations seen in the non-remission group
was statistically significant (p = 0.02). Children
in non-remission were also more likely to have a
history of allergic conditions (p = 0.007).

A Kaplan—Meir plot was produced to assess
the natural history of PU among the children
going into remission (Fig. 1). Of those going into
remission, 50% had done so approximately 2 yr
post-onset.

The survival analysis of the whole cohort
presents a less optimistic picture: the number of
children becoming urticaria free was 11.6% (95%
CI: 5.4%-23.9%) at 1 yr post-onset and 38.4%
(95% Cl: 25.9%—54.3%) 5 yr post-onset. However, it is important to note that a considerable
number of the non-remitting children are censored in the survival analysis (i.e., have not been
followed up for a prolonged period) — 25% had
had their urticaria for 30 months or less at the
time of the questionnaire.

Discussion

This is the largest reported study of physician
diagnosed PU in children. Overall, 38% of our

patients were free of symptoms at the time of the
study and the mean duration of symptoms was
30 months among those achieving remission. In
the adult study of Kozel et al. (6), the remission
rate for PU at | yr follow up was 16.4%, whereas
in our cohort it was 11.6%. Humphreys and
Hunter (3) found that symptoms were persistent
for more than 5 yr in 5% of children with PU
and 13% of adult patients. However, in our
study the average duration of urticaria for all the
children was 47 months suggesting a significantly
poorer prognosis and only 38.4% were urticaria
free 5S yr post-onset. Participation bias may
account for some of the difference in the poorer
prognosis in this study compared to previous
studies with respondents perhaps being more
likely to have on-going urticaria than nonrespondents. Selection bias may also be an issue
in that the population studied was derived from a
specialist tertiary referral allergy clinic, and
therefore is likely to represent the more severe
end of the spectrum of PU.

All the children had chronic urticaria. There
was no male or female predominance in children
suffering from PU in this study, although adult
studies have shown that about two-thirds of the
affected people are women (3). The dermatographic, cholinergic and mixed subtypes of PU
represented the commonest types of PU, in that
order, and together accounted for over 70% of
all cases. The frequencies of the different subtypes are in keeping with other researchers’
results (1, 3, 6).

In the current study, 67% of the children had
angioedema associated with their urticaria, and
13% reported respiratory involvement. The
study of Sackesen et al. (1) included a very small
number of children, and reported that associated
angioedema occurred in 59% of the cases.

Children with PU can present at any age. The
mean age of onset in the remission and nonremission groups is very similar, which from a
clinical perspective means that age alone will not
discriminate who will achieve remission. In
contrast, frequent episodes (daily) and a history
of allergic conditions suggest a poorer prognosis.

In conclusion, PU is a relatively common
cause of chronic urticaria in childhood and
almost always affects quality of life. The
prognosis in this cohort would appear to be less
favorable than has been previously reported, and
prognostic factors are relatively few.
