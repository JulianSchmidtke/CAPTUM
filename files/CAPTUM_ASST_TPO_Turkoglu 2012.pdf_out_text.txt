Skin autoreactivity in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis
patients without urticaria: Autologous serum
skin test positivity correlation with thyroid
antibodies, sonographical volume and grading

Recent studies have shown an association between anti-thyroid antibodies and autologous serum skin test (ASST) positive urticaria patients.
However, a connection between thyroid and this reliable skin test for
mast cell autoreactivity, ASST, has not been reported yet. We investigated ASST in patients with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) without
urticaria and compared the results with laboratory and sonographical
findings of HT. 154 HT patients, 100 healthy volunteers without HT as a
first control group and 46 patients with multinodular goitre but without
autoimmune thyroid disease as a second control group underwent testing
with ASST. ASST was applied to these groups according to two criteria,
first as ASST(new): autologous serum red wheal response 1.5 mm
bigger than negative control; second as ASST(old): serum red wheal
response 5 mm bigger than negative control accepted as positive. Free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), thyroid-stimulating hormone
(TSH), thyroid peroxidase antibody (anti-TPO) and thyroglobulin antibody (anti-Tg) levels were measured. ASST(old), ASST(new) scored
positive in 51.3-60.4% of HT patients, with statistically significant
differences. Thyroid volume grades were inversely proportional with
ASST(old) and (new) positivity. Moderate (+) titers of anti-Tg in
ASST (old) and (new) (+) cases were significantly higher than the same
titers of anti-Tg in ASST(old) and (new) (-) cases. The prevalence of
ASST positivity in HT patients was not affected by the following factors:
gender, age at screening, laboratory measurements of thyroid function
tests, anti-TPO antibodies and thyroid ultrasound (US) echogenicity.
Positivity of ASST in HT has shown that there is a skin mast cell autoreactivity in HT patients independent of autoreactive chronic urticaria
(ACU).

he positive relationship between ASST(+) autore

autoimmune thyroid diseases (ATD) with thyroid autoantigen positivity is well known [1, 2]. In CU
patients, these autoantigens, anti-TPO and anti-Tg, have
been detected to be more common, with a ratio of 5-34%
compared with normal populations (5-10%) [3, 4]. Autoreactivity related with ASST positivity has been searched
for in association with autoimmune diseases, drug allergy
and hypersensitivity. But the effect of ATD on mast cell
autoreactivity has not yet been investigated. Inflammatory connections between autoantigen overload of thyroid
autoantigens [5, 6], toll-like receptors (TLR), Fe receptor pathways and mast cells remind us that IgE functional

dies can occur at any stage of the pathogenesis of ATD
[5, 7-12]. Current studies of autoimmunity have pointed out
the controversial issue of whether overload of autoantigens
in HT patients makes people candidates for urticaria, or
whether there is coexistence of urticaria with autoimmune
thyroiditis [5].

The aim of this study was to detect the effects of thyroid
gland mass and thyroid hormone levels on mast cell autoreactivity and at which stage this sensitization was effective in
HT patients without any urticarial symptoms and history of
urticaria. We used ASST, which is the best in vivo method
for detecting the autoreactivity of mast cells in blood via the
Fc receptor pathways. We compared the two forms of ASST
results with thyroid hormone levels and ultrasonographic
thyroid patterns in both HT and non-ATD patients.

Subjects and methods

Study population

Subjects were recruited from endocrinology and internal medicine clinics at the Istanbul Medeniyet University
Goztepe Training and Research Hospital. This prospective
study included 154 HT patients. A diagnosis of HT was
made in the presence of elevated anti-TPO, anti-Tg and
ultrasound patterns suggestive of HT. There were two control groups; the first control group included 100 healthy
volunteers without HT, classified as the “healthy control group”, and whose anti-TPO and anti-Tg levels were
normal. The second control group included multinodular
goitre (MNG) without ATD, the patients were assesed by
sonography and their anti-TPO and anti-Tg levels were normal. These 46 patients with MNG were classified as the
“patient control group”. Exclusion criteria from the study
included previous symptoms and diagnosis of any clinical
form of urticaria, autoimmune diseases, allergic or nonallergic respiratory diseases (asthma, allergic rhinitis, nasal
polyposis), pregnancy, smoking, NSAID hypersensitivity,
drug allergy, intake of antihistaminic treatment, antithyroid drugs, immunosuppressive treatments, high serum
immunoglobulin levels, personal history of stool test positivity and laboratory data. All groups were classified
according to gender and age range. There were three age
ranges were 17-30, 31-50 and 51-70.

Laboratory measurements

All individuals underwent an extensive laboratory work-up
that included complete blood count, biochemistry profile,
fT3, ff4, TSH, anti-TPO and anti-Tg levels before the
intradermal tests. 113 of 154 patients who accepted radiological evaluation in the thyroiditis study group and all
of the 46 patients in patient control group were assesed
sonographically for disease activity one day before intradermal tests by radiologist (OT) (Ultrasound System GE
LOGIQ 3, GE Medical Systems, Solingen, Germany, with
GE 7.5L75G Ultrasound Transducer, 7.5-MHz linear array
probe). The following US characteristics were examined: 1)
thyroid gland volume as low, normal, high (normal values:
17.5+3.2 mL for women and 19.6+4.7 mL for men) [13]; 2)
echogenicity of the solid portion (grade 1=normal:similar to
submandibular gland, hyperechoic to neck muscles, grade
2: hypoechoic to submandibular gland and hyperechoic to
neck muscles, grade 3: iso-/hypoechoic to neck muscles)
[14].

Patient and control group thyroid profiles were evaluated with thyroid function tests and thyroid autoantibody
levels by an endocrinologist (GT). The thyroid functions of
all patients were grouped into four groups: euthyroid, subclinical hypothyroid, overtly hypothyroid, hyperthyroid.
Anti-TPO and anti-Tg levels grouped in three groups by
titrations: for anti-TPO levels 34-100 IU/ml was accepted
as low (+), 100-1,000 IU/mL moderate (+), > 1,000 IU/mL
high (+) titers and for anti-Tg 115-200 IU/mL was accepted
as low (+), 200-1,000 IU/mL moderate (+), > 1,000 IU/mL
high (+) titers. Normal ranges of thyroid hormones were
0-34 IU/mL for anti-TPO, 0-115 [U/mL for anti-Tg, 0.274.2 IU/ml for TSH, 2-4.4 nq/mL for fT3, 0.8-1.76 ng/mL
for fT4. Levels of fT3, fT4, TSH, anti-TPO and anti-Tg

were measured with electrochemiluminescence immunoassay method by using Rosh firms’ Elecsis 170 device.

Intradermal tests

We performed intradermal tests, ASST, with both autologous serum, normal saline (negative control) and histamine
(positive control). Venous bloods of patients both from
the study group and control groups were taken in sterile
tubes which did not contain coagulation activator factors.
Samples were kept at room temperature for 30 mn and centrifuged with 500 g for 15 mn; 3 cm apart, three injections
of 0.05 mL autologous serum, normal saline and histamine
were given intradermally to the anterior of the left forearm and the wheal and erythema reaction was awaited.
Two ASST criteria were used: new and old. According to
ASST(new) criteria [15], an autologous serum red wheal
response 1.5 mm bigger than the negative control was
accepted as positive, after waiting 30 mn and according to
ASST (old) criteria [16], a serum red wheal response 5 mm
bigger than the negative control was accepted as positive
after waiting for both 30 and 60 mn. None of the patients was
taking systemic steroids, immunosuppressive or antihistaminic treatment during the tests. The patients and controls
gave informed consent and the study was approved by the
local Ethics committee.

Statistics

Descriptive statistical methods (mean, standard deviation),
student T test, Chi-squared test (y*) and Spearman rank correlation analysis were used for interpretation of the results,
comparison of groups, comparing quantitative data and correlation of groups, respectively. The results were evaluated
within p values of 0.05 and a confidence interval of 95%.
NCSS 2007&PASS and 2008 Statistical Software (Utah,
USA) programme were used for statistical analysis.

Results

Study group

There were no differences between ages and genders of HT
patients and control groups (p>0.05) (table 1). Thyroid US
was performed in 113 of 154 HT patients and thyroid volumes of 90 patients (81.1%) were found low, of 16 patients
(57.1%) were found normal size and of 7 patients (35%)
were found high. Thyroid volumes of HT patients were
significantly lower than thyroid volumes in the patient control group (p<0.01) (table 2). According to thyroid US
echogenicities, HT patients in the thyroiditis study group
and MNG patients in the patient control group were determined as grade | at 38.9% and 65.2%, as grade 2 at 45.1%
and 30.4%, as grade 3 at 15.9% and 4.3%, respectively.

ASST test

ASST (old) were positive in 79 (51.3%) of the thyroiditis
study group and were statistically significant compared to
healthy (15%) and patient (15.2%) control groups (p<0.01)
(table 1).

thyroid volumes. In the thyroiditis study group, in contrast to the patient control group, ASST(new)(+) patient
thyroid volumes were significantly lower than those of the
ASST(new)(-) patients (p<0.05).

In the thyroiditis study group, there was no statistically
significant difference between either ASST(old) and antiTPO titers or ASST(new) and anti-TPO titers (p>0.05).
However, moderate titers of anti-Tg in ASST(old)(+) cases,
moderate and high titers of anti-Tg in ASST(new)(+) cases
were significantly higher than the same titers of ASST(old)
and (new) (-) cases. (p<0.05) (table 3). The prevalence
of ASST positivity in HT patients was not affected by the
following factors: gender, age at screening, laboratory measurements of thyroid function tests, anti-TPO antibodies
and thyroid echogenicity.

Discussion

In this study we found that in HT patients, ASST results
were distinctly positive and this positivity was inversely
proportional with thyroid gland mass. Besides, the relationship between ASST, thyroid hormone levels and the
sonographic grading of thyroiditis were investigated but
we did not observe any relationship among them. This is
the first study to show skin mast cell autoreactivity with
ASST positivity in autoimmune thyroiditis patients without
urticaria.

O'Donnell et al. demonstrated a relationship between antiTPO and ASST(+), as they reported ASST positivity in
82% urticaria patients with thyroid autoantibody [7]. Positive reactions to intradermal injections of autologous serum,
which show functional IgG autoantibodies against the a
subunit of high affinity IgE receptors (FceRIa) and IgE
itself in vivo, simply and quickly, is seen in approximately 60% of CU [17]. Autoreactivity related to ASST
positivity has been searched for in association with nasal
polyposis (55%) [18], autoimmune diseases (lupus erythematosus, scleroderma) (30-40%) [19], seasonal allergic
rhinitis (29.8%) [20], intrinsic asthma (45%) [21], multiple
intolerance to NSAID (30%) [22], multiple drug allergy
syndrome (94%) [23], allergic rhinitis (29%) [24], non

allergic asthma and rhinitis (20%), allergic rhinitis/allergic
bronchial asthma (17.5%) [25].

In our study, we detected statistically significant positivity
of both old and new criteria of ASST in HT patients without
urticaria, 51.3% and 60.4%, respectively, compared with
the positivities of ASST in two control groups (table 1). We
aimed to increase the scientific value of our study by planning to work with two control groups, healthy volunteers
and non—ATD patients. We also used two ASST criterias;
1) ASST (new) which was formed from the 2009 consensus report (the latest published criteria) [14], 2) The method
of Grattan et al. (the first published criteria) [15] to reduce
false positivity of ASST. Unfortunately, we could not afford
basophil histamine release tests, to show correlation with
ASST, and this is the weak point of our study. The ratios
of ASST positivity in ATD overlapped interestingly with
ASST ratios of autoimmune urticaria in the literature [17].
In ATD (including HT and Graves’ diseases) autoantibodies are against TSH receptors, TPO and Tg [9-12]. Tg might
be involved in the pathogenesis through initiating a T cell
immune response to develop ATD, that then spreads to
involve other autoantigens like TPO. Tg also reflects thyroid cell mass [11, 26, 27]. TPO is a sequestered antigen
but appears in the case of thyroid tissue damage. Antibodies to thyroid peroxidase arise spontaneously with age and
appear after thyroglobulin antibodies [9, 26, 28]. It is also
known that the extracellular domain of TPO has a similarity of around 45% with myeloperoxidases from eosinophils
[5, 9].

In recent years, studies on mast cell biology and Fe receptor associations have demonstrated that there is a hidden
autoreactivity in many systems of our body. The thyroid is
one of the important organs that shares autoimmune process with the other systems [12, 26]. Mozena et al. reported
the lack of a role for cross-reacting anti-thyroid antibodies
in urticaria in a study on 20 patients, as in older studies
planned with small patient groups. These subsequent studies, using classic ELISA or RAST, were unable to show IgE
autoantibodies to thyroid antigens in patients with chronic
spontaneous urticaria and thyroid autoimmunity [29, 30],
probably due to interferring IgG autoantibodies [31] and the
limited sensitivity of these assays. Altrichter et al. demonstrated the relationship between thyroid, skin and thyroi

autoantibodies which had been unproven for so many years.
Additionally, they determined that mast cell autoreactivity
could be present with systemic involvement in IgE anti-TPO
(+) patients, as we pointed out in our study, autoantigen
overload of thyroiditis resulted in ASST positivity. In their
study, they were able to detect IgE specific for TPO by
two methods: classical ELISA and the new human-IgEcapturing-enzyme immunoassay. They demonstrated that
the IgE autoantibodies detected in their study were directed
against an extracutaneous antigen (=autoallergen), ie TPO,
which could be released from the thyroid into the circulation. IgE-anti-TPO is, therefore, likely to be bound to mast
cells, basophils and FceRI-expressing cells throughout the
body [5]. This may explain the ASST positivity we found
in HT patients.

In our study, the diagnosis of HT was made according to
textbook data: Elevated thyroid autoantibody levels (antiTPO and/or anti-Tg), heterogeneous and (other known)
parencymal alterations in thyroid tissue on sonographic
examination [11, 14]. Graves’ diseases and Graves’
disease + HT were excluded clinically or sonographically
by an endocrinologist. HT was mirrored by a hypoechoic
ultrasound pattern. Thyroid US measurements were
reported to have equal sensitivities and specificities with
anti-TPO [14]. Because of that, thyroid US was chosen
to confirm whether the severity of thyroid inflammation
was related with the positivity of ASST in varying titers of
anti-TPO (+) HT patients.

We found no differences between the positivity and negativity of ASST in HT patients with respect to US echogenity
grades. In our study, while 85.5% of ASST(old)(+) HT
patients’ thyroid volumes were low, in ASST(old)(-) cases,
72.5% of HT patients’ thyroid volumes were low and
there was an negative correlation with ASST positivity and
thyroid volume. In contrast, ASST(new)(+) HT patients’
thyroid volumes were significantly lower than those of
ASST(new)(-) patients in the thyroiditis study group, when
we compared them with the patient control group. These
findings showed that, during the chronic stage of HT, thyroid volume gets smaller and, conversely, ASST positivity
increases.

We found no differences between the (+)/(-) results of
ASST(old) and ASST(new) with respect to thyroid function groups comparing the thyroiditis study group and the
control group patients. Many of the HT patients with positive ASST(new) and ASST(old) were euthyroid (table 2).
Besides other findings, in ASST(new)(+) cases, especially
moderate and high (+) titers of anti-Tg were significantly
higher but there was no relation between anti-TPO titers
and ASST. This finding was not compatible with our
knowledge of anti-TPO and mast cell relation studies in the
literature. We found that moderate anti-Tg titers correlated
with ASST(old) and (new). Tg and thyroid volumes were
inversely proportional in our patients (table 3). In a previous study, Buchanan ef al. demonstrated an intradermal
skin test with an extract of human thyroid gland. Moreover,
in this study, Tg antibodies were demonstrated by the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis technique [32]. The anti-Tg and
thyroid volume relationships to each other and to ASST that
we observed in our study may be due to inflammation seen
with ASST(+) ATD and the presence of circulating TPO,
IgE-anti-TPO, basophils and eosinophils [5-7].
Pathophysiologically, disorders of cellular immunity exist
in HT initially because of a genetic defect of T supressor

 

EJD, vol. 22, n° 3, May-June 2012

cells, CD4*CD25*-regulatory T cells (CD25*Treg) [33].
As shown by in vivo studies, CD25* Treg cells cause supression of switching IgG class to IgE anti-TPO of B cells
but in HT this supression of switching is not seen. IgE
production increases. IL4, in the beginning, and the other
ILs are secreted from Th2 cells [33-36]. Moreover, IL-4
increases the number of FceRI receptors [37, 38]. In
summary, FceRI expression and the switching of IgG antiTPO to IgE anti-TPO are increased by the reduction of
CD25* Treg levels [35-38]. In brief, TPO and Tg are higher
allergenic proteins that start the circle of thyroid-skin mast
cell-humoral/cellular immunity with an excessive autoantigen load, resulting in ASST(+). Maurer et al. demonstrated
the “Ag overload” to be the main disorder in the pathogenesis of autoreactive urticaria and they defined better
results with omalizumab in urticaria through the presence
of anti-TPO positivity [39]. Altrichter et al. reported in
their study that IgG-anti-TPO-positive patients were more
likely to express potentially urticaria-inducing (ASST positivity inducing) than IgE-anti-TPO patients [5]. We would
like to point out that ASST helps us to show the excessive
autoantigen overload that affects mast cells. Our results on
ASST(+) autoreactivity in HT patients were not suprising
as we previously knew that TPO binds to C4 and leads
to complement, mast cell activation and mast cell stimulation threshold decreases when an inflammatory process
takes place in the thyroid, and IgE-anti-TPO comes later by
circulation [5, 36, 40, 41].

Our study supports the study of Altrichter et al. on the
thyroid—Fe receptor-mast cell circle, which demonstrates
that the autoantigen=autoallergen excess which plays an
active role in the pathogenesis of urticaria is formed by
thyroid antigens, TPO, IgE-anti-TPO [5, 39]. Our results
show that ASST is an in vivo marker of autoimmnity that
could point out the overload of functionally active autoantibodies like IgG anti-TPO (correlated with IgE-antiTPO), anti-Tg, especially binding to FceRIa antibodies [5].
Our results determine that ASST is a test peculiar to the
mast cell-related autoimmune disease complex, rather than
to ACU diagnosis.

In conclusion we have demonstrated the link between the
thyroid gland and skin mast cells through ASST and sonographical findings of thyroid. We believe that ASST will
be a widely used skin test to understand potential upregulation of autoreactivity of other systemic diseases related
with mast cells.
