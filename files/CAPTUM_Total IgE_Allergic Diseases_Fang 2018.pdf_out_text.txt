Abstract

Background: The relationship between allergic disease and
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is poorly understood. We
aimed to investigate the potential association as well as the
underlying immunological mechanisms. Methods: A retrospective case-control study of 108 atopic patients from
among outpatients in an allergy clinic (allergic rhinitis [AR],
n = 49; chronic urticaria [CU], n = 59) and 74 controls from
among ward companions was conducted from November
2016 to March 2017. The detection rates and related gastrointestinal (Gl) symptoms of IBS, as well as immunological indices, were calculated. Results: CU patients had a trend of
increase in the detection of IBS compared to controls (OR =
4.846; 95% Cl 0.967-24.279, p = 0.077). Loose stools (OR =
2.406; 95% Cl 1.075-5.386, p < 0.05) and viscous stools (OR =
2.665; 95% Cl 1.250-5.682, p < 0.05) were more common in
CU patients. Atopic patients positive for serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) (OR = 3.379; 95% Cl 1.088-10.498, p < 0.05)
or house dust mite (HDM)-specific IgE (OR = 3.640; 95% Cl

1.228-10.790, p < 0.05) were more likely to have abdominal
bloating. Besides, a positive association between levels of
total IgE and severity of abdominal bloating was observed
(p < 0.05). An HDM-specific IgE-positive reaction was independently associated with abdominal bloating in atopic patients (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Allergic disease has a clear
clinical association with IBS with more frequent and severe
symptoms of IBS. CU patients have a tendency to suffer from
IBS, usually with diarrhea. Serum total IgE and HDM-specific
IgE are positively correlated with GI symptoms in atopic pa
tients. © 2018S. Karger AG, Basel

Introduction

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional
bowel disorder that presents as recurrent abdominal pain
associated with defecation or a change in bowel habits.
The worldwide prevalence of IBS is 11.2%. The incidence
of IBS is 1.35-1.5% [1]. The prevalence of IBS reached

5.9% in South China in 2016 [2]. IBS is a multifactorial
disorder with a complex pathophysiology [1].

Allergic diseases, including allergic rhinitis (AR), asthma, urticaria, eczema, atopic dermatitis, and food allergy,
implicate approximately 20% of the population. Allergic
disease can cause local end-organ dysfunction and even systemic symptoms [3]. Previous studies have suggested that
specific allergen exposure may contribute to IBS-related
gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in allergic individuals [4, 5].
Preschoolers with allergic diseases have an elevated risk of
IBS [6]. On the other hand, patients with IBS have a higher
risk of allergy than patients without IBS [3, 7].

T-helper 2 (Th2) immune activation has been associated with allergy and IBS. The pathology of active wheals
in patients with chronic urticaria (CU) has shown a large
number of degranulated mast cells [8]. Relevant allergen
exposure causes relief of inflammatory mediators of hypersensitivity through cross-link of immunoglobulin E
(IgE) on mast cells in patients with AR [9]. In addition,
increased mast cells in the duodenal and colonic mucosa
have been found in patients with IBS [7].

However, the relationship between allergy and IBS remains controversial. The pathophysiological mechanisms
of the association are still unclear. To investigate the relation between allergic disease and IBS, we conducted a retrospective case-control study to evaluate the detection
rates of IBS and IBS-related GI symptoms and the association of immunity and GI symptoms in atopic patients.

Materials and Methods

Participants

This study was carried out at the Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang
University School of Medicine during a 4-month period from November 2016 to March 2017. Atopic patients were referred to the
Allergy Clinic of The Second Affiliated Hospital. Those who had
history of allergen exposure or possible exposure, like seasonal onset, were recruited into the allergy group, and among them those
with AR or CU were recruited into the AR subgroup or the CU
subgroup, respectively. The diagnosis of AR is based on the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) 2008 guideline [10].
The comorbidity was calculated, and 6 cases of eczema and 2 of
conjunctivitis were found among the AR patients, according to
ARIA 2008 and JDA 2009 [10, 11]. The diagnosis of CU was made
according to the EAACI/GA?LEN/EDF/WAO guideline [12].
Healthy controls were recruited from ward companions and excluded if they had: (1) a history of any known chronic diseases involving the respiratory, GI, cardiological, urinary, hematological,
endocrine, or nervous system; (2) any acute infection in the last 3
months; (3) a history of any documented allergic diseases or related allergic symptoms; or (4) a history of any medication of
known diseases. Informed consent was obtained from all of participants in our study. All of the patients and controls included in

this study gave their written informed consent that the study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the First
Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University.

IBS Evaluation and GI Complaints

All participants completed the IBS questionnaire (Rome IV criteria [1]). Individuals diagnosed with IBS should meet the following
criteria based on Rome IV: recurrent abdominal pain, on average, on
at least 1 day a week in the last 3 months, associated with 2 or more
of the following criteria: related to defecation, associated with a
change in stool frequency, and associated with a change in stool consistency. Then, patients who fulfilled the criteria were followed by the
gastroenterologists for differential diagnosis of IBS and other related
GI diseases. The individuals also answered questionnaires about IBSrelated GI complaints. Abdominal discomfort (abdominal pain or
bloating) and habits and characteristics of defecation were assessed
inall of the participants. Incidence, frequency, and severity were evaluated. GI symptoms had to have been experienced during the last 3
months with symptom onset at least 6 months before consulting. The
frequency of abdominal discomfort was divided into the following 5
grades: “never,” “occasionally” (once or twice a month), “sometimes”
(once or twice a week), “usually” (3 or 4 times a week), and “always”
(every day). The severity of abdominal discomfort was divided into
the following 4 grades: “none,” “mild,” “moderate” (tolerable), and
“strong” (unbearable). The severity of hard stools was described as:
“none,” “lumpy,” or “nut-like.” The severity of loose stools was described as: “none,” “soft,” “mushy,” or “watery.”

 

Cellular and Immunological Examination

The blood eosinophil counts, serum total IgE, house dust mite
(HDM)-specific IgE, and food-specific immunoglobulin G4
(IgG4) of the allergic group and the eosinophils and total IgE of the
controls were analyzed using the ImmunoCAP system [13]. A positive reaction to total IgE was defined as levels increasing to more
than 100 KU/L. A positive reaction to HDM-specific IgE was defined as levels increasing to more than 0.35 KU/L. A positive reaction to food-specific IgG4 was defined as increased levels of IgG4
(2250 U/L) to at least one food allergen.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Product
and Service Solutions, version 22 (IBM SPSS Statistics 22, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). An unpaired-samples Student’s ¢ test and the
Mann-Whitney Utest were used to test differences between groups.
The x? test was used for comparisons of categorical variables. Correlation analysis was performed using Spearman’s correlation test
and linear regression models. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the factors independently associated
with GI symptoms. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The AR group was younger than the controls (p < 0.05).
Nine of the 108 (8.3%) patients with allergic disease reported IBS. Among the patients with CU, 7 out of 59
(11.9%) reported IBS compared to 2 out of 74 (2.7%) controls (OR 4.846; 95% CI 0.967-24.279, p = 0.077).

 

Allergy and IBS

IBS-Related GI Symptoms

The occurrence, frequency, and severity of IBS-related
GI symptoms were analyzed in patients with allergy, AR,
or CU compared to controls (Table 1). Loose stools were
found in 33.9% of patients with CU and in only 17.6% of
the controls (OR 2.406; 95% CI 1.075-5.386, p < 0.05).
The severity of the symptoms also increased in patients
with CU compared to controls (p < 0.05). In addition, viscous stools were found in 42.4% of patients with CU but
in only 21.6% of the controls (OR = 2.665; 95% CI 1.2505.682, p < 0.05) and in 22.4% of patients with AR (OR =
2.540; 95% CI 1.089-5.924, p < 0.05). With adjustment for
age and sex, patients with CU had higher odds of viscous
stools compared to controls (p < 0.05) and AR patients
(p < 0.05). Moreover, loose stools were modestly more
common in patients with CU compared to controls (p <
0.05). However, GI symptoms did not differ significantly
between atopic patients and controls.

In correlation analysis, the frequency of stools was
positively correlated with the disease course of urticaria
in patients with CU (p < 0.05, r= 0.3849). Linear fit results
are shown in Figure 1.

Immunity and GI Symptoms in Allergic Patients

Blood eosinophil counts, serum total IgE, HDM-specific IgE, and food-specific IgG4 were measured in allergic patients (see online suppl. Table S1; see www.

the allergy group (OR = 3.379; 95% CI 1.088-10.498, p <

in total IgE levels along with an increase in the severity of
abdominal bloating in atopic patients (259.23 + 415.18
and 501.91 + 504.07, p < 0.05; Fig. 2). Additionally, patients positive for HDM-specific IgE were more likely to
have abdominal bloating than negative patients in both
the allergy (OR = 3.640; 95% CI 1.228-10.790, p < 0.05)
and the CU groups (OR = 9.750; 95% CI 1.880-50.556,

In the multivariate adjusted analysis with adjustment
for age and sex, a positive reaction to HDM-specific IgE,
rather than total IgE, was independently related to abdominal bloating in atopic patients (p < 0.05).

In the present study, we investigated the association
between allergy and IBS-related symptoms, while further
exploring the underlying immunological mechanism.

Our study first revealed more frequent and severe IBS
symptoms in allergic patients, especially in the subgroup
of CU patients. In recent decades, several studies have
investigated the relationship between allergy and IBS. A
previous study showed a greater risk of subsequent IBS
in children with antecedent allergic disease [6]. Lower GI
symptoms such as diarrhea are common in children with
allergy [14, 15]. Intestinal permeability was significantly
increased in patients with atopy compared to nonatopic
patients [16]. Seasonal inhalation of birch pollen has
been suggested to cause a duodenal increase in IgE-bearing cells [5]. However, the association between AR or CU
and IBS has rarely been identified. Jones et al. [7] reported a significantly higher prevalence of any atopic condition in patients with IBS. They found an elevated prevalence of hay fever/rhinitis with an OR of 2.98 (95% CI
2.63-3.37, p < 0.0001) in IBS patients compared to controls. Tan et al. [6] conducted a population-based casecontrol study and found the highest OR (i.e., 1.78) for IBS
in patients with AR (95% CI 1.69-1.87) among all antecedent allergies in children, followed by an OR of 1.56
(95% CI 1.40-1.73) in children with urticaria. In our
study, we used the detailed categories for symptom detection and thus proved a clear association between CU
and IBS. However, we failed to show a significant association between allergy and IBS, as well as between AR
and IBS. This study merely shows a tendency toward a
difference between allergy patients and controls in symptoms of loose or viscous stools, whereas there was no tendency toward a difference between AR patients and controls, which might have affected the significance between
allergies and controls. These inconsistent findings pro

pose the need for additional large-scale population-based
investigations.

The mechanisms underlying this association are still
unclear. An IgE-mediated immune reaction might be the
bridge under this association, supported by the positive
correlation among serum total IgE, HDM-specific IgE,
and abdominal bloating in atopic patients. As is known,
dysregulated immune activation on the epithelial barrier
surfaces is common in both allergy and IBS [17]. Lillestol
et al. [16] reported earlier that elevated numbers of IgEpositive cells in duodenal mucosa were found in patients
with atopy compared to nonatopic patients. Besides,
numbers of IgE-positive cells in duodenal mucosa were
significantly correlated with levels of serum total IgE.
Vara et al. [18] reported that complaints of mild to moderate GI were positively associated with higher total IgE
levels, and this was confirmed in our study, as the severity of bloating in subjects in our analysis was mostly mild
to moderate. Recent studies reported 2 cases of a positive
clinical response to omalizumab in patients with IBS-D
and concomitant CU and asthma, respectively [19],
which further confirmed this viewpoint.

On the other hand, the GI mucosal immune system
probably has an effect on allergic disease. Local inflammation may influence the systemic immune homeostasis.
Degranulation of mast cells in the intestinal mucosa is associated with the release of bioactive mediators, such as
histamine, tryptase, chymase, and prostaglandin D2,
which may indirectly affect the activation of immune responses [20]. Other inflammatory cells, including lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, can be
found migrating to end-organs of allergic lesions. Neurotransmitters participating in regulation of the intestinal
barrier, like substance P, help to perpetuate and further
he allergic inflammation [21]. Moreover, it has recently
been suggested that imbalances in the composition of the
intestinal microbiota might trigger allergy. The intestinal
microbiota not only regulates the intestinal mucosal immune system but also takes part in systemic inflammatory responses [22]. It has been found that a reduced gut
microbial diversity in infancy is associated with an increased risk of allergic manifestations in school-aged children [23]. In an animal model, it was shown that microbial colonization induces appropriate maturation of the
Th2 response and IgE regulation during the early developmental window time [24].

CU is a complex disease with multiple etiologies including chronic infections, autoimmune reactions, allergy, and even tumors in rare conditions. The pathological
mechanism is still unclear. Most cases of CU have spon

taneous provocations of symptoms and do not show direct connections to specific allergens. However, atopy
characterized as an increase in total IgE can be found in
many patients with CU, and the present study is the first
to observe the connections between clinical symptoms
and serum immunologic indices like specific allergen IgE
and total IgE. The results did show this connection, although further studies are needed to explore the mechanism of this connection.

Our study showed that this clinical association was
more prominent in CU and IBS-related symptoms. It is
in agreement with the recent discovery of Magen and
Chikovani [19] of a strong association between IBS and
CU in a cross-sectional study of a large cohort (11,271
patients). Data that CU patients were more likely than
controls to have loose or viscous stools suggested the association between CU and diarrhea. We subsequently
found that the disease course of urticaria was positively
correlated with the frequency of stools, which identified
the association between CU and lower GI symptoms. The
mechanisms of the association of CU and diarrhea are
still unclear. Minnei et al. [25] suggested that CU is associated with gastroduodenal mast cell infiltration. In addition, CU is often aggravated by the intake of pseudoallergen-containing foods, which might be associated with
mast cell infiltration in the GI mucosa. Dunlop et al. [26]
reported that diarrhea-predominant IBS was associated
with increased lamina propria mast cells and T lymphocytes. Moderately increased mucosal mast cells were positively correlated with visceral hypersensitivity and intestinal permeability in patients with D-IBS [27, 28]. Therefore, we supposed that intestinal mast cell infiltration was
associated with diarrhea in CU patients. However, the
pathological mechanisms of CU were complicated, including IgE-mediated, autoimmunological, and nonimmunological etiologies, whereas they were predominantly IgE mediated in AR [29]. So whether the underlying
mechanism of CU and diarrhea involves more than one
type of immune response (e.g., IgG mediated) needs further investigation. Besides, AR was usually associated
with upper GI diseases, like oral allergy syndrome triggered by pollen, food, or eosinophilic esophagitis [30, 31].

The role of food allergy in IBS has been reported in
previous studies. A portion of clinical trials of exclusion
diets based on food-specific IgE and IgG4 have been reported successfully [32]. In addition, the relationship between food allergy and other allergic diseases, such as urticaria and AR, has been shown in previous studies [33,
34]. Food-specific IgG4 is actually one immunologic index connected to many diseases including allergic dis

eases. It is not the direct etiology provoking the symptoms, but studies have indicated that it might play roles
in recurrent attacks of allergic diseases [35]. Previous
studies have presented the role of allergen-specific IgG4
in inducing the release of histamine from eosinophils, as
IgE did in allergic diseases [36]. However, Antico et al.
[37] reported that 62% of patients with allergic dermatosis were food-specific IgG4 positive and did not have any
acute or delayed adverse reactions towards specific foods.
It is suspected that IgG4 has an effect of the diagnosis of
food allergy. The role of food-specific IgG4 in allergic diseases needs further research. However, our study failed to
observe an obvious association between food-specific
IgG4 and IBS or IBS-related GI symptoms in atopic patients. Besides, there was no significant difference in
food-specific IgG4 positivity ratse between AR and CU
patients. The role of food-specific IgG¢4 in IBS is still controversial.

There are some limitations to our study. First of all, the
number of samples was limited. The number of patients
with IBS was not adequate for prevalence examination or
further studies of subtypes of IBS. Secondly, we did not
analyze allergic-specific IgE and food-specific IgG4 in
controls, so we were not able to identify the role of IgE
and IgG4 in GI symptoms in controls. Thirdly, not all of
the allergic conditions of CU were confirmed by IgE assays or the skin prick test. Fourthly, respondent bias existed in the diagnosis of IBS. In addition, exclusion of ab
References

dominal organic diseases lacked confirmation via a relevant imaging examination. Lastly, psychological and
social factors, diet habits, obesity, and seasonal variation
might have confounded our results.

In conclusion, patients with CU have a tendency to
suffer from IBS, usually with diarrhea. Allergic patients
positive for serum total IgE or HDM-specific IgE are
more likely to have abdominal bloating, suggesting a role
of IgE-mediated immune reaction in the effect of allergy
on GI symptoms. HDM-specific IgE positivity is an independent risk factor for bloating, indicating the relation
between HDM inhalation and GI symptoms. It is interesting to investigate the common pathological mechanisms between allergy and IBS, and the potential therapeutic value of anti-IgE therapy on IBS. Further researche
is necessary to deeply explore the association between allergic diseases and IBS.
