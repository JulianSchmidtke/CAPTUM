Summary

Background: Cholinergic urticaria (CholU) is a frequent type of chronic inducible
urticaria. Symptomatic treatment with second-generation antihistamines (sgAH) is
recommended by current guidelines as first-line therapy, but little is known about
how patients with CholU are treated in real life and how they respond to treatment.
Aim: To assess real-life treatment of CholU in German-speaking countries.
Methods: Patients with CholU (n = 111) took part in an online survey study that assessed their treatments and their treatment responses.

Results: Virtually all patients (97 %) had used antihistamines, 87 % of them sgAH;
23 % had also taken first-generation antihistamines (fgAH). The proportion of patients
who benefited from standard-dosed antihistamine treatment was low (sgAH: 32 %
vs. fgAH: 16 %), and side effects of sgAH and fgAH were comparable. Updosing of
antihistamines had been tried by 66 patients (59 %) (most commonly [98 %, n = 65]
with sgAH) and resulted in marginally better responses (sgAH: 38 % vs. fgAH: 32 %).
Only very few patients had used other treatments, mostly corticosteroids (30 %) and
omalizumab (5 %).
Conclusions: SgAH were commonly used, but insufficient in about two thirds of

CholU patients. Accord
options and developme!

ingly, improved use of third-line and fourth-line treatment
nt of better therapies for patients with CholU are needed.

Introduction

Cholinergic urticaria (CholU) is a frequent skin disorder that
affects up to 20 % of the population, mostly young adults
{1]. It is a form of chronic inducible urticaria characterized
by small, itchy wheals, pruritus and, in up to 50 % of patients, angioedema [2, 3]. The symptoms of CholU are induced
by passive warming and physical activity. Many patients are
affected by their CholU on a daily basis, and CholU can have
a strong impact on quality of life [4-6].

The pathogenesis of CholU is still not completely understood. Histamine and other inflammatory mediators released
by mast cells are thought to be the key drivers of the development of CholU signs and symptoms. Accordingly, antihistamines are the main therapeutic approach for the management
of CholU [7, 8].

The current EAACI/GA?LEN/EDF/WAO urticaria
guideline recommends, as first-line treatment, the use of

second-generation H1-antihistamines (sgAH) in licensed
doses, once daily. Updosing of sgAH (off-label) up to fourfold is the recommended second-line therapy, if enough
symptom control cannot be achieved with standard
 

dosed sgAH. Despite updosing, antihistamines are often
ineffective, or at least do not control the development of
symptoms completely [9, 10]. In the guideline, further
treatment escalation is recommended when sgAH do not
lead to complete disease control. As third-line and fourthline therapy, add-on omalizumab [11] and cyclosporin is
recommended (Online Supplemental Figure 2a), but none
of these therapies are currently licensed for the treatment
of patients with CholU.
Little is currently known about the real-life treatment

 

 

situation of patients with CholU. Which treatments are used
as first-line and second-line therapies? How effective are
they? How well do patients with CholU tolerate their treatment? These questions remain to be answered. To address

this gap in our knowledge, we analyzed 111 patients with
CholU by means of a German survey study.

Materials and Methods

Online Survey

This web-based survey study and the German questionnaire used in this study were developed at the Urticaria Center
of Reference and Excellence (UCARE; [12]) at Charité —
Universitatsmedizin Berlin in collaboration with the Urtikaria Network e.V. (UNEV) and the Urtikaria Netzwerk
Berlin-Brandenburg envy. (UNBB), and it took place from
May 2016 to August 2017. This study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of the Charité — Universitatsmedizin Berlin
(#EA1/241/15) and was registered in the German Clinical
Trials Register (DRKS-ID: DRKS00012387).

The character of this questionnaire was mainly descriptive and exploratory, and we included CholU patients from
Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Patients had to be 18
years or older, and trigger factors of CholU had to be plausible. To ensure data quality, only patients whose CholU
diagnosis was verified by a physician were included in the
data analyses (Online Supplemental Figure 1), which resulted in 111 analyzed CholU patients in the present study. The
online survey was anonymous and voluntary. Patients had to
read the patient information and had to confirm actively that
they wanted to participate in this project before starting the
questionnaire. Demographic data of the analyzed patients
are presented in Table 1.

*One patient stated a duration of 6 weeks.

The questionnaire was divided into five sections: i) symptoms, trigger and duration of disease, ii) patient quality
of life, ii) activity and work management with the disease,
iv) number of consultations, qualification of the doctors seen
and contentment with the treating physicians, v) treatment
regimens used, symptom improvement and side effects. The
present report is focused on the results obtained in section
i) and v) (see Online Supplemental Text 1). Results from
sections ii) to iv) will be reported elsewhere.

Assessment of treatment regimens, symptom
improvement and side effects

Patients were asked about the treatments they had received
for their CholU, including the types of medication used, their
dosages and treatment durations. Antihistamines were grouped into fgAH and sgAH. For each of the medications used,
patients were asked to rate their response to this medication
in terms of the benefit they experienced. To this end, patients
used 4-dimensional Likert scales (very good, good, minor,
not at all) to describe the reduction of symptoms and their
treatment satisfaction. Finally, patients were asked if they
experienced unwanted effects of the therapies used and to
provide information on what these effects were.

Statistical Analyses

Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 23 and GraphPad Prism Version 6.0. Binominal
variables were analyzed using the Chi-square test or Fisher’s
exact test for low numbers (less than 5). Non-parametric continuous variables and categorical variables were compared using
the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis test, respectively. P < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

Results

The 111 patients with physician-verified CholU analyzed
in this study were between 18 and 78 years of age (median 36 years) and mostly female (76.7 %). Most patients
lived in cities (70.3 %) rather than in rural areas (27.9 %).
Ninety-eight of the patients (88.3 %) were from Germany
(the rest of the participants lived in Switzerland, Austria or
did not state their country of residence; see Table 1, patient
characteristics).

Patients in this survey showed a broad range of symptom
severity and quality of life impairment due to their CholU.
About half of the patients (52.2 %) reported severe or very
severe symptoms, the other half had moderate or mild symptom or no symptoms at all during the past four weeks (Online
Supplemental Table 1a). About half of the patients (45 %)
had severe quality of life impairment, one third (30.6 %) had

mild quality of life impairment, and the remaining patients
had little or no impairment of quality of life due to their
CholU (Online Supplemental Table 1b).

CholU patients use antihistamine treatment,
usually second-generation antihistamines

Almost all the patients (97.3 %) stated that they had taken an
antihistamine at the licensed dose because of their CholU symptoms at some time while their disease (one patient had not
taken antihistamines, two patients had missing entries). Most
patients (87.0 %) had taken second-generation antihistamines
(sgAH), in line with current guideline recommendations. Several patients (43.2 %) had taken more than one type of sgAH,
but only 18 patients (16.2 %) had taken two or more different
AHs in parallel. 23.1 % of patients had also taken first-generation antihistamines (fgAH), mostly dimetindene. Information
on the antihistamines used is provided in Table 2.

In CholU, standard-dosed antihistamine
treatment improves symptoms in less than one
third of patients

Less than one in three patients (31.9 %) with CholU experienced very good or good symptom improvement in response
to treatment with a standard-dosed sgAH. The rest of the
patients had only minor or no beneficial effect from this
therapy (Figure 1). Only 27.7 % of patients rated their overall
satisfaction with standard-dosed sgAH therapy as very good
or good.

Even fewer patients benefited from good symptom improvement due to standard-dosed fgAH (Figure 1). Only one
in five patients (20 %) rated their overall therapeutic satisfaction with fgAH as good. No patient rated the satisfaction as very good. More than two thirds of the patients in
both groups (sgAH and fgAH) had only minor or no overall satisfaction using standard-dosed treatment (satisfaction
fgAH compared to sgAH; Mann-Whitney-U test; p = 0.449).

At the time of the study, 65 % of patients who used
standard-dosed sgAH, but only 24 % of patients using fgAH
were still using this treatment (Chi-Square test; p < 0.001).
More than two thirds of patients of both AH groups (73.1 %
sgAH, 70.6 % fgAH) stated that they had stopped this
treatment due to the lack of therapeutic effect. The therapeutic response, satisfaction or side effects of antihistamine

treatments were not linked to the age or sex of CholU patients or to the duration of their disease (Online Supplemental
Table 2).

Antihistamine treatment in patients with CholU
often has unwanted effects

Of the CholU patients who used sgAH and fgAH treatment at the standard dose, 42.6 % and 36.0 % experienced
adverse reactions, respectively. In both groups, fatigue was
the most common unwanted effect (Table 3). Despite overall
low numbers, gastrointestinal side effects were only reported
in patients treated with sgAH (32.5 % vs. 0 %, Fisher’s exact
test p = 0.003). There were no major differences in the rate
of side effects regarding the sort of antihistamine used. A
detailed description of the side effects for each antihistamine
is given in Online Supplemental Table 3a, b.

Side effects were the second-most common reason for
discontinuation of standard-dosed treatment in both CholU
patients who were treated with an sgAH (19.2 %) and patients who were treated with fgAH (11.8 %). Side effects of
antihistamine treatments were not linked to the age or sex of
CholU patients or to the duration of their disease.

The effects of antihistamine updosing on
symptom control and rates of unwanted effects

Almost two of three CholU patients (n = 66; 59.5 %) in
our study had, at one time during their disease, used an
antihistamine at higher than the standard dose. The sorts
of antihistamines used in higher doses were comparable to
those where single doses were used (Table 4). Most (98.5 %,
65/66) of the patients who used AH in higher doses took
sgAH, while only seven out of 66 (10.6 %) patients had used
fgAH in higher doses. Only one CholU patient reported
solely updosing with fgAH. Six patients had tried updosing
with both sgAH and fgAH.

When sgAH were updosed, 38.4 % of the patients experienced very good or good symptom improvement, as compared to 31.9 % on standard dose. One in five patients on higher
than standard-dosed sgAH treatment had no improvement

Figure 2 Symptom improvement after use of higher than
standard-dosed sgAH treatment as compared to standarddosed sgAH treatment. Of the standard and higher than
standard-dose group, 6 (6.4 %) and 3 (4.6 %) patients,
respectively, did not provide information and were excluded
from the statistical analysis. The comparison of both groups
did not show a significant difference (p = 0.367).

Abbr.: n, number of patients; n.d., missing entries

on this therapy, as compared to 25.5 % on standard-dosed
sgAH treatment (p = 0.367) (Figure 2).

Of the patients who used a higher than standard-dosed
sgAH or fgAH, 56.9 % (37 of 65, sgAH) and 42.9 % (3 of 7,
fgAH) reported that they experienced side effects, most often
tiredness (30 of 37, sgAH: 81.1 %, 3 of 3, fgAH: 100.0 %).

At the time of the survey, the majority of the patients
who used an sgAH at higher doses (72.3 %, 47/65) were still
using this therapy, as compared to only 42.9 % (3/7) of the
patients using an fgAH at higher doses (p = 0.085). Patients
who had stopped their higher than standard-dosed antihistamine therapy most commonly did this because of a lack of
therapeutic effect (60.0 % sgAH, 75.0 % fgAH).

CholU patients often use corticosteroids and
rarely have access to omalizumab

Three out of 10 patients (29.7 %) had taken corticosteroids
at some time for the treatment of their CholU, most of them
(69.7 %) for a short period of two weeks or less. The rest had
taken them for longer, up to more than three months in one
case. With this therapy, 15.2 %, 33.3 %, 27.3 % and 18.2 %
of patients had complete symptom control, good, minor, and
no symptom improvement, respectively. Almost half of the
patients (45.5 %) who used a corticosteroid developed side

effects (26.6 % fatigue, 26.6 % headache, 26.6 % gastrointestinal side effects, 26.6 % insomnia and 20.0 % heart problems). At the timepoint of this survey 24.2 % of the patients
(n = 33) were still using corticosteroids. Patients who stopped
this treatment did so because of lack of effect (87.5 %) or side
effects (75.0 %).

Only six patients in our study had received omalizumab for their CholU, three of them for more than three
months. Three patients had complete or good symptom control, two minor and one patient no effect on the symptoms.
Two patients reported some side effects (fatigue, headache,
insomnia, indigestion) of omalizumab treatment. Three
patients were satisfied with this therapy, one was satisfied to
some extent and two not at all. Five out of these six patients
were still using omalizumab at the time of the survey.

Regarding other medications, five out of the 111 patients
had taken montelukast, one each had used cyclosporin A, an
anticholinergic drug and betablocker. Eight (7.2 %) had tried
other therapies, such as cortisone cream or acupuncture.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first real-life treatment study of CholU patients to be conducted in German-speaking
countries. Our study shows that virtually all patients with
CholU use antihistamine treatment, including higher than
standard-dosed antihistamines. This treatment can effectively reduce symptoms, but it does not provide sufficient
improvement in most patients.

Unchanged for years, the recommended first-line and
second-line treatments for patients with chronic urticaria
(including CholU) are standard-dosed or higher than standard-dosed sgAH [13, 14]. Patients with CU who do not
respond to these treatments should receive omalizumab, in
line with the most recent guideline [11]; this drug is currently
licensed only for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria but not CholU. In our patient population, 87 % of patients had used an sgAH, and more than half had used an
sgAH at higher than the standard dose. This is good and in
line with guideline recommendations. What is not good is
that one in four patients, at the time of the study, was treated
with fgAH and/or corticosteroids. First-generation antihistamines and corticosteroids are not recommended for the routine treatment of CU due to their side effect profiles. It is also
not good that less than 5 % of the patients in our study had
received omalizumab, which has been shown to be effective
in most patients with CholU who do not respond to antihistamine treatment [15], most likely because this drug can only
be used off-label with CholU. Online Supplemental Figure 2b
gives an overview of the treatment regimens used, in parallel
with the current guideline. Our observations raise an interesting question — why do so many patients with CholU, and

especially those who do not respond to single-dose sg AH,
still receive treatment not recommended by the guideline
instead of guideline-recommended treatment?

Our study cannot answer this question, but it can provide some explanations: all in all, standard-dosed sgAH only
resulted in good improvement in one third of CholU patients.
SgAH updosing increased this improvement only marginally.
In other words, most patients with CholU require third-line
treatment. This high rate of sgAH-resistant CholU patients,
which is in line with previous reports from specialized urticaria centers [10], is likely to have patients and physicians
often turn to older fgAH and corticosteroids, which are still
held by many to be more effective than sgAH despite the fact
that several studies have shown that fgAH have far more and
more pronounced side effects than sgAH [16, 17]. The fact
that fgAH can also have anticholinergic effects, especially
when taken in high doses [16], and that anticholinergics can
be effective in CholU [18, 19] may contribute to the misconception that fgAH are more effective than sgAH in CholU.
Our results as well as other studies suggest that this is not
the case. The CholU patients in our study were less likely
to benefit from an fgAH than from an sgAH (although the
difference was not statistically significant). On the other
hand, our patients reported similar rates of side effects for
sgAH and fgAH, which is surprising, but may have contributed to the widespread use of the latter. The relatively high
rate of adverse events in CholU patients treated with sgAH
is in contrast to earlier studies [20]. What is clear is that in
CholU, data on the efficacy and safety of antihistamines, old
and new ones, standard and higher than standard-dosed, are
very limited. Better and larger studies are needed.

As for the use of corticosteroids, it is even harder to
understand why they still appear to be a common treatment
choice in CholU patients who fail sgAH treatment. Of our
patients who used corticosteroids, only one in three had good
symptom improvement, 30 % received corticosteroids for
longer than two weeks, and half of our patients experienced
side effects.

Only a few patients in our study received the guideline-recommended third-line (omalizumab n = 6) or fourthline (cyclosporin A n = 1) therapy for CU. The most important reason for this is probably that, in contrast to chronic
spontaneous urticaria, these therapies are not licensed for
the treatment of patients with CholU. Several recent studies
suggest that omalizumab is a promising therapeutic approach in patients with CholU who do not respond to antihistamines [21-24]. In our study, half of the CholU patients
treated with omalizumab benefited from this therapy. This
is by and large similar to the results of two previous studies, one with 31 %, the other one with 69 % of CholU patients who had major benefit from omalizumab treatment
(15, 25].

Our study has several limitations. It was performed as
an online survey, which bears the risk that not all patients
answered the questions correctly, that their statement of the
physician-made diagnosis was incorrect, and that the physician’s diagnosis was not correct. Of note, more than 80 % of
the participating patients indicated that their diagnosis was
made by a specialist, e.g. a dermatologist or a physician in a
special urticaria center or hospital. Another limitation of our
study is that patients did not answer the questions in a standardized or supervised setting. Also, patients with a higher
burden of suffering are possibly more likely to participate in
such an online survey. It is also quite subjective, since patients do not have to respond to questions within a given timeframe, and they do not benefit from being able to interact
with the experts at a clinical study center, as is the case for
controlled clinical trials. Also, we lack information about the
compliance of the patients with their therapy, which could
be a reason for unsatisfactory treatment responses. Although
the total patient cohort (more than 100 patients) was reasonably large, some of the subgroups we compared, e.g. standard-dosed vs. higher than standard-dosed treatment, are

 

 

rather small. It would be interesting to compare treatment
regimens and effects in patients with CholU in a more standardized, parallel group and placebo-controlled study that
includes the use of provocation testing and recently reported
patient outcome measures [26, 27].

Nevertheless, our findings provide new and valuable
insights on real-life treatment patterns in patients with CholU,
including their efficacy and side effect profiles. Given the large
percentage of patients with insufficient treatment responses to
licensed treatment options, it is essential to develop different,
more effective therapies for patients with CholU. There is also
a need for education on how to optimize long-term treatment
of CholU with the treatment options available.
