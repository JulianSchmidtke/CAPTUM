Abstract

Background: The real-life data on the effectiveness and safety of omalizumab in chronic
spontaneous urticaria (CSU) with validated methods are scarce. There is also lack of

information on the use of combination treatments.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was done to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of
omalizumab in real-life conditions. The patients with CSU treated with omalizumab between
2015 and 2018 were included. The response to therapy was evaluated using urticaria activity

score over 7 days (UAS7) and urticaria control test (UCT).

Results: A total of 106 patients were included. A complete respons€ (CR) (UAS7:0) and a
well-controlled activity (WCA) (UAS7:1 to <6) were observéd.ine50 (47.2%) and 35 (33%)
patients, respectively. The number of patients with an (UCT, score >12 was also significantly
increased. Higher rates of CR/WCA were observed with,omalizumab monotherapy compared
to combination with antihistamines. The combination of dapsone, colchicine and omalizumab

provided additional benefit in a small. group»

Conclusion: Treatment with omalizumab provided a rapid and sustainable improvement in
real-life settings. The use of omalizumab as monotherapy or combined with antihistamines
does not show differences in the treatment response. The combination of omalizumab with

immunomodulatoryeagents might be of benefit in selected cases.

Keywords: Chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic urticaria, omalizumab, real-life.
Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is an inflammatory condition characterized by the
persistence of wheals and/or angioedema (AE) for >6 weeks [1]. Various international
guidelines recommend omalizumab as a third-line agent for treating CSU [1-3]. The efficacy
and safety of omalizumab treatment for CSU has been demonstrated in randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) [4-8]. Although RCTs are the gold standard method for evaluating the efficacy
and safety of treatment modalities, there is a growing interest for real-life studies. These
studies provide information on the effectiveness on the drug in a more heterogeneous group of
patients with more reasonable treatment-adherence levels and comorbidities; andvover a
relatively longer period to evaluate long-term effects and side effects [9,10]°\Nevertheless,
real-life data on omalizumab treatment for CSU remains scarce, and’ mostly derived from
studies lacking standardized treatment protocols and validated.methods to measure treatment
response. Considering these gaps, this retrospective Cohortystudy aimed to evaluate the
effectiveness and safety of omalizumab treatment for CSU in a real-life setting and to identify

patient and disease characteristics favoringya favorable treatment response.
Material and Methods

Patients who had been followed up in our specialized urticaria outpatient clinic and had
received at least one dose of omalizumab treatment for CSU between 2015 and 2018 were
included in the study. The study was reviewed and approved by our institution’s ethics
committee (Approval number: 09.2018.233).

In our clinic, demographic information and disease characteristics are recorded using a
medical chart at the initial visit. The patients with CSU unresponsive (UCT<12 and/or
UAS7=6 despite the regular use of nonsedating antihistamines up to four-fold standardydose)
antihistamines for >6 months are administered omalizumab. The treatment is 300 mg.every 4
weeks administered subcutaneously. The patients are followed up every 4—8 weeks. If the
patient achieves complete remission or shows well-controlled activityy/the dosing interval is
increased by | week at every visit following the first threestreatments. In case of a partial
response after six injections of omalizumab or any worsening during follow-up, we either add
immunomodulatory agents, such as colchicine,and dapsone, or increase the omalizumab dose
to 450 mg every 4 weeks or combine/switeh to treatment with cyclosporine. At every followup visit, the severity of the symptoms and disease control are evaluated by the urticaria
activity score over 7 days (UAS7) and the urticaria control test (UCT), respectively. The daily
UAS score is the sum of daily scores for intensity of pruritus and number of wheals. Thus, the
daily UAS scores ranges between 0 and 6, and UAS7 score ranges from 0 to 42 [11]. UCT is a
self-reported tool assessing the disease control in patients with CSU, and it provides a final
score between’ 0 and 16 [12]. UCT enables the physician to retrospectively evaluate the
disease control and AE symptoms; moreover, it is easy to administer and interpret in clinical
practice [12,13].

Medical charts of the patients were reviewed and the patients’ gender, age, smoking status,

personal history of systemic diseases, atopy, CSU duration, coexisting CIndU/AE, previous
treatments, baseline levels of total immunoglobulin E (IgE), D-Dimer, high-sensitivity Creactive protein (hsCRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were recorded.

Initial dose, frequency, maximum dose interval for omalizumab, concomitant treatments,
adverse effects, monthly UAS7, UCT scores were also recorded. Treatment response was
recorded as complete response (CR; UAS7 < 0), well-controlled activity (WCA; 1 < UAS7 <
6), partial response (PR; UAS7 > 6, but decreased compared to the baseline, at least 10
points), or no response (NR; no decrease in UAS7). The number of patients with an UCT
score > 12 were also analyzed. The patients who responded to treatment were also ‘grouped
according to the time to response as fast responders (response <1 month) or slow responders

(response >1 month).

Statistical Analysis
The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for’SociahSciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago,

Illinois, USA) v21.0. Descriptive data are shown as ‘n (%) for categorical variables and mean

 

+ standard deviation (SD; range) for quantitative variables. The chi-square test was used to
compare two categorical variables between independent samples. Student’s t-test was used to
compare means between two independent groups. Paired samples t-test was used to compare

two measurements within the same sample.
Results

A total of 106 patients were included in the study. Patient demographics, disease
characteristics, and laboratory tests at the baseline are detailed in Table 1.

At the time of the statistical analysis, 13 (12.2%), 37 (34.9%), 38 (35.8%), and 18 (16.9%)
patients were at the first, third, sixth, and twelfth months of omalizumab treatment,
respectively.

The initial dose for omalizumab was 300 mg in 103 patients, and only three had received 150
mg. All patients received the treatment every 4 weeks except one; this patient who received
150 mg every 2 weeks initially because of chronic renal failure, and then received.300 mg
every 4 weeks. The most common concomitant treatment was antihistamines in 61 (57.5%)
patients, whereas in 35 patients (33%) omalizumab was used as.a\ monotherapy. When the
omalizumab and antihistamine combination group was compared with the omalizumab
monotherapy group, the demographic and baseline diSease, characteristics (age, gender,
duration of disease, previous treatments, baseline UAS7, UCT scores) were similar (p>0.05).
However, the ratio of the patients showing&:CR andyCR/WCA were significantly higher in the
monotherapy group (CR:80% vs 31.1%.and CR/WCA:94.3% vs 77%) (p=0.0001 and 0.029).
A combination of dapsone (150 mg/day)eand colchicine (1.5 mg/day) was used in 3 patients in
whom the disease was recalcitrant.to antihistamines and omalizumab. This combination led to
CR in two of them and’dapsone, colchicine and antihistamines were gradually discontinued
within 4 months. The pre-combination UAS7 scores of 18 and 24 improved to 0 in both
patients and the precombination UCT scores of 8 and 10 improved to 16 in both of them
following the treatment. They are still on remission with omalizumab treatment every 4 and 8
weeks. The remaining patient did not show any improvement and is being treated with

omalizumab 450mg monthly. The treatment characteristics are provided in Table 2.
The mean UAS7 and UCT scores significantly improved every month during the first 6
months of treatment (p<0.05). The mean UAS7 and UCT scores during the treatment were
provided in Fig. 1. The number of patients with a UCT score of =12 was 1 (0.9%), 70 (66%),
73 (78.5%), 53 (94.6%), and 18 (100%) at the baseline, first, third, sixth, and twelfth months
of treatment, respectively (p <0.001). Of the 56 patients who had received 6th dose, 32 had
CR, 19 had WCA, 4 had PR and one patient had NR. Eighteen patients continued the
treatment for one year. Of them 12 had CR, 5 had WCA and | had PR. The patient with PR
was lost to follow-up, but the CSU was stable in the remaining patients with ‘ongoing
treatment. Treatment response at the final visit was detailed in Table 2.

At the time of the final analysis, 73 patients (68.8%) were still receiving» omalizumab
treatment, whereas 13 (12.2%) were lost to follow-up. Omalizumabswas) discontinued in 20
patients (19%). The reason was lack of efficacy in ten, remission in eight patients, and
adverse effects (exacerbation of urticaria and anxiety) inthe remaining two patients (Table 2).
Another patient experienced mild bronchospasm following the first injection of omalizumab;
however, treatment was continued. At the‘end of 3smonths, a WCA was achieved without any
recurrence of bronchospasm. Apart from these, no adverse effects were observed following a
total of 729 treatments administered, within the study period.

Among the eleven patients who, previously responded to omalizumab, retreatment with
omalizumab led to CR°if sixepatients and WCA in five.

The subgroup analysis according to gender; age; smoking status; coexisting CIndU or AE;
elevated levels of baseline total IgE, D-Dimer, hsCRP, and ESR; response to treatment; and
response time did not reveal a statistically significant difference in terms of treatment

response, response time, and adverse effects (p>0.05).
Discussion

The present study aimed to determine the real-life effectiveness and safety of omalizumab
treatment in a treatment antihistamines resistant CSU cohort. Its results showed a significant
improvement, according to UAS7 and UCT scores, without any serious adverse events or
long-term toxicity.

The prevalence and incidence of CSU are higher in women [14] and this trend was observed
in the present study as well. AE was present in approximately 70% patients, which is higher
compared to previous reported data about 16-33% of patients with CSU [15,16], This
discrepancy might be explained because of AE data was collected using .a\self-reported
questionnaire in this study or because our patients had more severe CSU €ompated to general
population studies. The frequency of coexisting CIndU in our study*population was 15%,
which was reported to be 20-36% in recent studies [16,17]..dhisymight be explained by the
fact that the provocation tests were carried out only in patientsyreporting a physical triggering
factor.

The efficacy and safety of omalizumab impatients,with CSU have been reported in several
RCTs [4-8,18]. Most of these studies.have evaluated the treatment response according to
changes in UAS7 scores. Baseline UA'S7 scores of the patients in these studies ranged
between 26.5 and 31.8, whichywas similar the score of 26 in the present study, indicating
severe disease. In ourstidypthe mean change in UAS7 score compared to baseline was —17.2,
—20.7, -22 and =22 ih the first, third, sixth, and twelfth months of treatment, respectively.
Consistent with our results, Saini et al. reported 13 points of decrease in UAS7 score
following 1 month of treatment [4]. Similarly, the previous phase-III studies reported UAS7
score decreases ranging from 12.1 to 20.7 at the third month of treatment [6,7,18]. The
treatment was found to be safe in the earlier studies, with only 0%-4.4% patients

discontinuing because of adverse effects (exacerbation of urticaria and anxiety) [4,6,7,18]. In
line with these data, only two patients (1.8%) discontinued the treatment because of adverse
effects in our study. Taken together, these data confirm the effectiveness and safety of
omalizumab in real-life use which is comparable to clinical studies.

Most of the real-life studies on omalizumab in CSU have limitations because of their
retrospective and multicentric design. In previous studies, omalizumab administered at doses
of 150 or 300 mg resulted in complete or significant/satisfactory improvement in 66%-88%
patients [19-23]. In line with these studies, we observed a CR or a WCA in 80% of our
patients.

Unlike these studies, standardized treatment response evaluation methods, and \treatment
protocols were used in our study. We observed a decrease in mean UAS7 score from 26 at
baseline to 8.8 and 4.8 at the first and third months of treatment, respectively. These results
are consistent with those of other studies reporting a decrease\in,UAS and UAS7 scores
following omalizumab treatment [19,24—26].

This study is in support with the use of UCT as ‘an“indicator of disease control with
omalizumab [27]. UCT was recently developed to assess the disease control and aid treatment
decisions patients with CSU. It also evaluates the symptoms associated with AE [12].
Besides, the changes in UCT scores=strongly correlate with the changes in the chronic
urticaria-specific quality-of-life. questionnaires [28]. UCT scores of =12 and 16 indicate a
good disease controlyand full control of symptoms, respectively [12,29]. In our study, the
number of the patients with a UCT score of =12 increased continuously during the study
period. Moreover, the rate of the patients with a UCT score of 16 improved from 0% to 31.2%
and 55.6% at the third and twelfth months, respectively. A recent study reported that minimal
clinically important difference of UCT was three points [28]. In the present study, the change

in UCT score from baseline to first month was —5.8, indicating a rapid and effective disease
control with omalizumab. These results, along with those from previous studies, further
confirm the effectiveness and safety of omalizumab in real-life settings.

An earlier study has shown that continuing treatment with omalizumab up to 24 weeks led to
CR in patients who failed to achieve a CR at 12 weeks [30]. Moreover, extending the
treatment up to 6 months was reported to offer added benefit in partial responders [31]. The
statistically significant improvement in UAS7 scores up to sixth month in our study supports
these data. However, the current study failed to find any predictors of early treatment
response, unlike a previous study reporting an association between serum autoreactivity and
slow response to omalizumab [32].

Some previous studies investigating the clinical and laboratory predictors of response to
omalizumab have reported a better response to omalizumab in patients with negative serum
autoreactivity; more recently, better response was correlated,qwith,higher baseline serum IgE
and D-Dimer levels [33-36]. However, the present sttdy was unable to reproduce those
findings. A possible explanation for our results may ‘be the small number of patients with
baseline laboratory test results.

Omalizumab was administered as either an add-on treatment along with antihistamines or
monotherapy. Although not systematically recorded, in most of the patients using
antihistamines as a concomitant treatment, the need for the antihistamines decreased
compared to baselineyas wasspreviously reported in a study [26]. The CR rates in the patients
without any concomitant treatment were significantly higher than the patients concomitantly
treated with\antihistamines. These results confirm the different mechanism of action of
omalizumab and antihistamine being the therapeutic response independent of each other.
Although, these results can simply be explained with the patients showing CR/WAC do not
need regular use of antiHl, we could ask ourselves if maintaining the use of antiH1 is

necessary during the treatment with omalizumab. In the future, studies comparing the
effectiveness of omalizumab monotherapy to the omalizumab add-on treatment along with
antihistamines are warranted.

Another new aspect of this study was the combined use of dapsone and colchicine with
omalizumab and antihistamines. The combination was well tolerated and led to CR in 2 of 3
patients. Following the remission dapsone, colchicine and antihistamines were gradually
discontinued, and the remission was maintained with omalizumab monotherapy. We believe
that in case of partial response to omalizumab, combination treatment with
immunomodulatory drugs might be a safe and effective treatment option in addition to
omalizumab updosing. The future studies on the efficacy of different combinationsuin partial
responders to omalizumab might be of interest.

Although the study population was small to draw definite conclusions, retreatment with
omalizumab led to CR or WCA in all 11 patients whoepreviously responded well to
omalizumab. These results are similar to those obseryed)in an previous study [37], further
confirming that the effectiveness and safety.of omalizumab are maintained in subsequent
retreatment cycles.

Our study has some limitations. First.is the lack of information on the relapse rates of the
patients in whom the treatment was stopped because of remission. Second, the current study
was not specifically designed ‘to_evaluate if any laboratory tests correlated with treatment
response. Regardlessythe small number of patients with baseline laboratory tests and the lack
of serial laboratory examinations to assess if test parameters change parallel to treatment
response are limitations. Third, there is not a systematic approach to the need for concomitant
medication. But, the concomitant use of the UAS7 and the UCT to assess the treatment
response and disease control of CSU patients in real-life clinical settings provides valuable
information. In our experience, we think that omalizumab treatment in CSU provides rapid

relief of symptoms and high levels of patient satisfaction, with sustainable effectiveness
during prolonged treatment. We believe that prospective studies focusing on the clinical and
laboratory biomarkers of treatment response, the effects of omalizumab updosing, the optimal

treatment duration and the post-treatment course of the CSU are warranted.
