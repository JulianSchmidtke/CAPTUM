ABSTRACT

Background: A Worldwide Antihistamine-Refractory Chronic Urticaria (CU) patient Evaluation
(AWARE) is a non-interventional, multicenter study including patients from Europe, Central and
Latin America, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East. AWARE describes real-world evidence for CU,
including clinical characteristics, treatment patterns and the impact on quality of life.

Methods: Over the 2-year study, therapy changes, angioedema occurrence, and patientreported outcomes (PROs) were recorded over 9 visits, including dermatology life quality index
(DLQI) and 7-day urticaria activity score (UAS7). Data were stratified into subgroups: chronic
spontaneous urticaria (CSU), chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU), or CSU + ClndU.

Results: Out of 4838 patients analyzed, 9.9% were receiving no treatment for their CU symptoms
at baseline, and 20.4% were receiving first-line non-sedating Hj-antihistamine at approved doses.
The predominant baseline therapy was up-dosed non-sedating H,-antihistamines (25.5%). By Visit
2, omalizumab was the overall most commonly used therapy (29.6%), increasing to 30.1% by the
end of the study. Baseline DLO! scores for patients with CSU, ClndU and CSU + ClIndU were 8.3,
7.6 and 9.1, respectively; scores decreased over the study for CSU and CSU + CindU patients, but
fluctuated for ClndU patients. Baseline angioedema occurrence was higher in CSU and
CSU + ClndU patients, reported in 45.4% and 45.5% of patients, respectively, compared to 17.0%
in ClndU patients. By the final visit, angioedema had decreased to 11.9% and 11.2% for CSU and
CSU + ClndU, respectively, and 9.6% for ClndU.

 

Conclusion: CU patients are undertreated at baseline; after entering the AWARE study, more
patients received appropriate treatment. However, over two thirds are not escalated to third-line
treatments.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a heterogeneous group
of skin diseases characterized by the rapid and
recurrent appearance of itchy wheals, angioedema, or both, for longer than 6 weeks.’ CU has
two subgroups: chronic spontaneous urticaria
(CSU) and chronic inducible urticaria (ClndU).
CSU is characterized by the spontaneous
occurrence of wheals and/or angioedema, is
more common than ClndU, and accounts for
approximately two-thirds of CU cases.” In ClndU,
specific triggers such as cold temperatures
induce wheals and angioedema (cold urticaria).
Around 20% of patients with CU have a
combination of CSU and ClndU (CSU + ClndU).*
With a point prevalence of 0.5-1% and a peak
incidence in individuals between 20 and 40 years
of age,” CU is a common disorder that has a
profound impact on patients’ quality of life
(QoL).>7

w

 

Historically, physicians have used H,-antihistamines as the standard of care in CSU."*?
According to the current EAACI/GA?LEN/EDF/
WAO guidelines for CU, the recommended firstand second-line therapies are standard-dosed
and up-dosed (up to 4 times the approved dose)
second-generation, non-sedating H,-antihistamine, respectively." However, many patients
continue to experience CU signs and symptoms
despite taking these treatments,’° with as many
as 60% of patients with CSU not achieving
symptom control at approved doses."* The thirdline treatment option is omalizumab, the only
other licensed treatment for CSU. Several studies
have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of
omalizumab in Cue additionally,
omalizumab has over 15 years of clinical
experience, and over 1.3 million patient-years of
exposure (PSUR: Novartis Data on File as of
December 31, 2019).

Our understanding of the causes and pathogenesis of urticaria is increasing; '°"8 however, a
need exists for global studies to gain greater
understanding of the burden of disease, different
treatment options used for CU, the lack of
adherence to recommended guidelines, '? and
the high rates of patients who are
undertreated.’° To date, no worldwide study has
been conducted to evaluate treatment decisions

and the impact these decisions have on QoL in
patients with CU. Previous data on the AWARE
study in Europe, Central and Latin America
(LaCAN)/Europe, and Asia-Pacific and the Middle
East (AMAC) have been published.?° 22 Our
current study aims to investigate these questions
from 3 regions across the world - Europe,
LaCAN, and AMAC. We analyzed extensive
pooled data from centers across the 3 AMAC
regions to understand the impact different
treatment options have on symptom control and
QoL in H;-antihistamine-refractory patients with
CSU, ClndU and CSU + ClndU, over a two-year
period.

METHODS
Study design

A Worldwide Antihistamine-Refractory CU patient Evaluation (AWARE) is a pooled noninterventional study that comprises 3 worldwide
multicenters (Europe, LaCAN, and AMAC), which
includes first-line H,-antihistamine-refractory patients with CSU, ClndU, and CSU + ClndU from
real-life clinical settings. Detailed study designs for
each region have previously been reported.'®
Over the two-year study period (across 9 visits
each spaced at around 3 monthly intervals), data
were collected to analyze the effects of different
treatments on symptom control and improvement
in QoL. Baseline therapy and therapy changes
were also recorded. To analyze changes over time,
patient-reported outcomes (PROs) including
dermatology life quality index (DLOI [scale 0-30,
with higher worse]) and 7-day urticaria activity
score (UAS7 [scale 0-42, with higher worse]) were
recorded, as well as angioedema occurrence. Data
were stratified according to diagnostic group:
CSU, ClndU, and CSU + ClndU.

 

Patients had a baseline Visit (Visit 1) and 8
follow-up visits in roughly quarterly intervals.
Average visits relate to the following timeframes:
Visit 1, 0 months (Day 1, baseline); Visit 2, 3
months; Visit 3, 6 months; Visit 4, 9 months; Visit 5,
12 months; Visit 6, 15 months; Visit 7, 18 months;
Visit 8, 21 months; and Visit 9, 24 months.

The institutional review board of each participating center approved the study protocol. The
trial was conducted in accordance with the
Volume 13, No. 9, Month 2020

Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice
and in compliance with all federal, local, and
regional requirements. The manufacturer of omalizumab sponsored AWARE.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The inclusion criteria were as followed: patients
aged >18 years, who provided written informed
consent, a medically-confirmed diagnosis of CU
(defined as recurrent episodes of wheals [hives],
angioedema, or both) for at least 2 months, presence of signs and/or symptoms of CU, and patients must have tried at least one course of H;antihistamines (at any approved dose) for 2 weeks
and been refractory to this treatment. Patients who
were involved in or planned to participate in
another interventional clinical study for CU were
excluded.

Patients

Data from 5223 patients enrolled from urticaria
centers and office-based dermatological practices
across the 3 study regions were pooled, including
3741 from Europe, 989 from AMAC, and 493 from
LaCAN. In total, 385 patients discontinued the
study due to not meeting the study criteria. Of the
remaining 4838 patients included in this analysis,
those with CSU made up the majority of the population (3,387, 70%), followed by patients with
CSU + ClndU (1,203, 24.9%) and ClndU (248,
5.1%, Table 1).

This study was designed and implemented in
accordance with the ethical principles in the
Declaration of Helsinki.

Patient-reported outcomes

The once-daily Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7)
and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLO!) were
used to assess disease activity and impact on patients’ QoL, respectively. UAS7 assesses disease
activity with 2 questions about wheals and itching
over 7 consecutive days, which ranges from 0 (no
disease activity/complete response to treatment)
to 42 (highest possible disease activity).?* DLOI is
a validated, | dermatology-specific _10-item
questionnaire covering 6 areas: symptoms and
feelings; daily activities; leisure; work and school;
personal relationships; and effects of treatment
on daily life. The DLOI score ranges from
0 (highest QoL) to 30 (lowest QoL).?4

RESULTS

At baseline, 1 in 10 patients were receiving no
treatment, and only 1 in 2 patients were receiving
first- or second-line CU treatment

Out of 4838 total patients, 480 (9.9%) patients
were receiving no treatment for their CU symptoms at baseline, and only 986 (20.4%) were
receiving the recommended first-line non-sedating
H,-antihistamine at approved doses. The most
commonly used therapy at baseline was secondline up-dosed non-sedating Hj,-antihistamines,
which was used by 1236 (25.5%) patients (Table 2).
Other treatments that patients used at baseline
consisted of omalizumab, montelukast, and
ciclosporine (Table 2).

The use of up-dosed non-sedating H;-antihistamine consistently decreased throughout the twoyear study period, and by the end of the study
(Visit 9) was used by 352 (13.8%) of the remaining
2559 patients (Fig. 1). A similar trend was
observed for patients treated with the standard
dose of non-sedating H,-antihistamine therapy,
which decreased to 375 (14.7%) patients by the
end of the study (Fig. 1). Overall, the proportion of
patients either on no treatment, first-, second or
third-line treatments did not differ between baseline (77%) and the end of the study (77.8%;

equal to baseline and ongoing at baseline. Visit 9 is approximately 24 months after baseline and defines the end of study. The table below
the graph shows the total number of patients who remained in the study throughout the 2-year period. AH, antihistamine.

Omalizumab use increased from baseline to
become the most commonly used treatment
throughout the study

Overall, 720/4838 (21.2%) patients were using
omalizumab at baseline, which increased to 769/
2559 (30.1%) patients by the end of the study.
There was an increase in its use by Visit 2 to 1128/
3811 (29.6%), and it remained the most
commonly used treatment throughout the study
(Fig. 1).

Nearly half of all patients had angioedema at
baseline, which decreased to 1 in 10 by the end of
the study

At baseline, 2116/4812 (44.0%) patients reported angioedema (Table 1); those with CSU
(1527/3,363, 45.4%) and CSU + ClndU (547/
1,202, 45.5%) had the highest occurrences o
angioedema. By the end of the © study,
angioedema had decreased to 11.9% (179/1502
and 11.2% (55/490) for CSU and CSU + ClndU,
respectively, with a consistent decline throughou
the entire study period (Fig. 2). Comparatively,
only 17.0% (42/247) patients with ClndU reported
having angioedema at baseline, which decreased

 

to 9.6% (11/115) by the end of the study.
Although angioedema occurrence remained low
in patients with ClndU compared to those with
CSU and CSU + ClndU, the percentage of
patients with angioedema fluctuated throughout
the two-year study period (Fig. 2).

DLOI scores of 0/1 steadily increased throughout
the study period in all diagnostic groups

The overall baseline DLOI score was 8.5
(Table 1). At baseline, the percentage of patients
with a DLOI score of 0/1 was 17.4% (569/3275),
15.1% (37/245), and 12.5% (147/1172) for CSU,
ClndU, and CSU + ClndU, respectively. This
increased consistently over the 2-year study
period for patients with CSU and CSU + ClndU,
but fluctuated for patients with ClndU (Fig. 3).
Patients with CSU achieved the highest
proportion of DLOI scores of 0/1 throughout the
entire 2-year study, increasing consistently until
patients achieved a maximum of 58.9% (854/1451)
at Visit 8 (21 months). The percentage of patients
with CSU + ClndU achieving a DLOI score of 0/1
also increased consistently to a maximum of 50.3%
(232/461) by the end of the study. For patients with
ClIndU, 49.5% (48/97) achieved a DLO! score of 0/

consistently throughout the two-year study with
patients achieving the lowest mean UAS7 score of
5.2 by the end of the study (Fig. 4 A and B).

DISCUSSION

The non-interventional AWARE study includes
4838 patients from Europe, LaCAN, and AMAC,
and provides valuable data on treatment patterns in
patients with CU across the world. Variations in
treatment options for CU were observed
throughout this two-year study, alongside improvements in PROs across all diagnostic subgroups. Although no direct correlations can be
made with non-interventional studies, the sustained
improvement in PROs confirms previous reports

that effective CU treatments can improve QoL and
reduce disease severity and the occurrence of
angioedema in H,-antihistamine-refractory
patients. 1:25:26

At baseline, as many as 1 in 10 patients reported
receiving no CU treatment, and only 1 in 5 patients
were receiving the recommended first-line treatment of standard-dose H,-antihistamines. Followup data suggests that, over 2 years of treatment,
less than 1 in 3 patients who may have benefitted
from being moved to the more effective third-line
treatment were actually switched to that treatment;
this of course, could also have been due to funding issues or patient preferences.

All analyzed patients had medically confirmed
CU; it is possible that some of the patients who
were not receiving any CU treatment had experienced a long period between disease onset and
diagnosis, and therefore they did not receive

appropriate treatment in a timely manner. Availability and reimbursement of omalizumab is likely
to differ between participating centers, and
indeed, within continents. The current study was
intended to provide an overall picture of treatment
patterns and their outcomes by pooling the 3 regions, thereby maximising the population size.
Results presented herein can help inform future
non-pooled studies that compare different regions
on socioeconomic issues, which influence treatment choices. We note that omalizumab for the
treatment of ClndU is off-label, and evidence for its
efficacy in CU mainly comes from its use in patients
with CSU.® We suggest more detailed studies
would help determine clinicians’ treatment
choices.

The most frequently used therapy at baseline
was up-dosed H;-antihistamines. By Visit 2, many
patients had been switched to the next treatment
step, as per the guidelines. The continuous decline
8 Maurer et al. World Allergy Organization Journal (2020) 13:100460

http://doi.org/10.1016/j.waojou.2020.100460

in the use of Hy-antihistamine and up-dosed H;antihistamine throughout the study period suggests that first- and second-line treatments were
ineffective in controlling CU symptoms.

The increase in patients who reported receiving
no treatment from baseline to the end of the study
could be due to many reasons such as spontaneous remission, or the fact that physicians were
unaware of CU treatment guidelines and options.
This supports results from previous studies that
have highlighted the challenges currently faced in
CU disease management.?” Because CU is a selflimiting disease,2® the decrease in treated
patients could be due to natural improvements in
disease activity, or because patients are part of a
protocol with regular follow-up visits. This
inherent limitation of CU causes challenges in data
interpretation. Our study highlights the high
number of patients who, by the end of a two-year
follow-up period, have not received the appropriate, effective treatment to tackle their CU.

 

 

The overall number of patients reporting
angioedema declined for all CU subgroups indicating that the treatment strategies over the previous 2 years were effective in controlling
angioedema, especially in patients with CSU and
CSU + ClndU. The occurrence of angioedema is
higher in patients with CSU or CSU + ClndU, with a
baseline incidence of over 45% patients in both
subgroups compared to 17% in patients with
ClndU. Patients with ClndU reported the lowest
evels of angioedema, which may be reflective of
he subtle differences in pathophysiology between
he subgroups. Angioedema has been shown to
detrimentally affect disease severity and patients’
QoL,’? and it is reported to correlate with the
highest CSU activity (UAS7);2? this is reflected in
he baseline DLO! scores of each diagnostic
subgroup in this study, which show that patients
with CSU and CSU + ClndU both reported the
highest DLOI scores of 8.3 and 9.1, respectively,
compared to 7.6 in patients with ClndU.

 

 

 

 

Overall, patients’ DLO! scores in all subgroups
decreased throughout the two-year study period
with more patients with CSU achieving a DLOl
score of 0/1 than in any other group. However, the
percentage of patients achieving DLOI 0/1 in the
ClndU group fluctuated and was similar to the
fluctuations observed in the angioedema

occurrence in patients with ClndU. This reflects the
impact of angioedema on patients’ DLQI scores
and highlights the importance of controlling
angioedema occurrence during CU management.

Baseline UAS7 scores for patients with CSU
(17.6) suggest these patients had moderate disease severity, over which they had achieved good
control by Visit 6 (6.2) and maintained until the end
of the study (5.2). Results from this study also
suggest that patients with CSU are more likely to
have steady improvements over time, unlike the
fluctuating trends observed in patients with ClndU
and CSU + ClndU, indicating that disease management is consistent in patients with CSU.

 

Prospective, non-interventional studies have
inherent limitations: due to the range of centers
from which patients were recruited, there is a lack
of consistency in available treatments, eg, thirdline omalizumab treatment is not generally available in the community, and therefore this will have
influenced the final results. Additionally, the
severity of CSU may be affected by many factors,
including physical and psychological stress, and
associated allergic disease, which we did not
measure in the current study.

 

 

In summary, it appears that a high proportion of
patients with CU are not receiving any treatment
for their condition, and as few as 1 in 5 patients
receive the recommended first-line treatment of
standard-dose H,-antihistamines. Additionally, less
than 1 in 3 patients who should be moved to a
more effective third-line treatment are actually
switched to that treatment, thereby indicating the
possible need for further education of clinicians in
the management of CU. Global multicenter studies
are required to help highlight the discrepancies in
CU management and inform clinicians of effective
and reliable treatment strategies for all CU
patients.
