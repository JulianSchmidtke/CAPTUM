Abstract

Background: The aetiology of chronic urticaria is heterogeneous. Physical urticaria (PU) is estimated at around 35%,
autoimmune urticaria (AIU) at 25% and chronic idiopathic
urticaria (CIU) at 35% of all chronic urticaria cases. Methods:
Differences in clinical and laboratory parameters among
AlU, PU and CIU groups were examined. AIU was diagnosed
if the basophil CD63 assay was positive. Demographic data,
severity of symptoms and association with allergic and autoimmune diseases were analysed by the aid of a questionnaire. Immunoassays were carried out and the effectiveness
of therapy was also investigated. Results: Concerning the
urticaria score, AIU patients had significantly higher total urticaria scores than patients with CIU (p = 0.013), dermatographic urticaria (p = 0.05) or cholinergic urticaria (p = 0.038).
Between CIU and dermatographic urticaria and between
ClU and cholinergic urticaria patients, we found insignificant
differences in the urticaria score (p = 0.707 and p = 0.336,
respectively). AIU was more frequently associated with autoimmune diseases in the personal history (p <0.001) and with
other types of urticaria in the family history (p < 0.001). Also,
anti-thyroid antibodies were more frequently detected in

the AIU group. Antihistamine therapy was less effective in
the AIU group (12.8%) than in the PU (70.3%) and CIU groups
(68.6%), but there were no significant differences between
the CIU and PU groups regarding the effectiveness of antihistamine therapy. Conclusion: The autoimmune subgroup
represents the most severe form of chronic urticaria. On the
other hand, there were no significant differences between
the CIU and PU groups neither in urticaria scores nor in response to antihistamine therapy.

Introduction

When wheals occur for more than 6 weeks with daily
or almost daily appearance, the diagnosis is chronic uricaria. The continuously itching and burning skin lesions with the consequent sleeping disorders distract paients from their daily activities and are responsible for
impairment in their quality of life.

The aetiology of chronic urticaria is heterogeneous [1,
2]. In some cases, urticaria may develop on a pseudoalergic or focal infection-related basis, while the aetiological role of real food allergy is minimal in chronic urticaria [3]. The urticaria-provoking effects of additive substances are frequently discussed in the literature. Greaves
4] found that food additives could be substantiated to be

causative in not more than 5% of cases, while others reported higher figures [5, 6]. A few years ago chronic focal
infections, especially Helicobacter pylori infection, were
regarded as having a major role in the aetiology of chronic urticaria. Recently, some authors demonstrated that
the provoking effect of Helicobacter pylori infection in
chronic urticaria was insignificant and only limited to a
few cases [4, 7, 8].

Grattan et al. [9] reported that 35% of chronic urticaria cases were physical urticarias (PUs). PUs frequently occur together, and their symptoms develop just after
exposure to physical stimuli and disappear not more than
1-2 h later, except in delayed pressure urticaria (DPU)
[10]. PUs are traditionally included in the non-restrictive
definition of chronic urticaria, although they are commonly intermittent and form a diverse disease group,
having little resemblance to chronic idiopathic urticaria
(CIU) and autoimmune urticaria (AIU) [2].

In the last decade, several research teams have investigated a special form of chronic urticaria, AIU, which
presumably constitutes 20-35% of all cases [9, 11]. AIU
patients have antibodies in their serum that react with the
a-chain of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRIa) or
with IgE itself. These pathogenic antibodies, which belong to the IgG] and IgG3 subclasses, were demonstrated
to cause histamine release by directly cross-linking the
IgE receptor and this activation was augmented by complement [12-16].

In the diagnosis of AIU, the autologous serum skin test
(ASST) is frequently used, although this method does not
identify patients with autoantibodies but rather those
with serum autoreactivity [17]. For a definitive diagnosis,
further examinations are usually needed, either by functional or binding assays. One of them, the gold standard,
is the basophil histamine release (HR) test [18]. In recent
studies, a new method, the modified CD63 expression
assay, was found to be a reliable method for the diagnosis
of AIU [19-22].

If no aetiological factors are found in spite of extensive
investigations, the diagnosis is CIU [9].

In the present study, our aim was to further investigate
the usefulness of the CD63 assay in clinical practice. We
differentiated AIU from CIU on CD63 assay positivity.
Our further objective was to study demographic data, urticaria score parameters, other accompanying diseases,
the presence of autoantibodies and the effectiveness of
therapy in patients with AIU and CIU. Although the PU
group includes diverse diseases, this form of chronic urticaria was also investigated.

Patients and Methods

Patients

We examined 109 patients with chronic urticaria. The mean
age was 39.8 + 15.8 years (range 13-74 years), there were 82 females and 27 males (female to male ratio 3:1). From the history of
the 109 patients the mean duration of skin symptoms was 24.7 +
36.4 months (range 2-231 months).

After informed consent had been obtained, the patients were
subjected to a diagnostic protocol which included detailed history taking, physical examination, routine laboratory tests and
provocation tests for PU. Urticaria patients with focal infection or
a drug or food allergy as aetiological background were excluded.
Biopsy was performed if the possibility of urticaria vasculitis existed. The ASST and CD63 assays were performed on every patient. The 109 patients suffering from PU, CIU and AIU were then
asked to fill in an internationally accepted questionnaire. Patients
suffering from more than 1 form of chronic urticaria were excluded.

Symptomatic dermatographic urticaria (DU) was diagnosed
in 48.1% (13/27) of the PU patients, cholinergic urticaria (CU) in
33.3% (9/27), DPU in 11.1% (3/27) and cold urticaria in 7.4%
(2/27). DPU patients with associated AIU were excluded from the
study. The skin symptoms of patients suffering from DU and CU
appeared several times a week. Because of the heterogeneity of the
PU group, we divided the group into subgroups and the urticaria
score parameters were counted separately. As only the 13 patients
with DU and the 9 patients with CU fulfilled the criteria of continuously existing chronic urticaria and patients with DPU and
cold urticaria were rather considered as intermittent urticaria
forms, only patients with DU and CU were analysed in the urticaria score measurements.

Antihistamines were withdrawn 72 h before provocation tests,
while corticosteroids and other immunosuppressant drugs were
withdrawn at least 4 weeks prior to provocation tests, ASST and
laboratory examinations. After the completion of the aforementioned investigations, a treatment protocol was started on all patients. The protocol was approved by the local ethics committee.

 

Questionnaire

All patients filled in a questionnaire, which was kindly provided by M. Kozel (Department of Dermatology of the Academic
Medical Center, University of Amsterdam) [23], and which was
supplemented with a few questions of ours. From this form, more
accurate information was gained about the sexual distribution,
the severity of symptoms and the disease course. Personal and
family history were thoroughly investigated regarding the occurrence of other types of urticaria as well as allergic and autoimmune diseases.

Measurement of Urticaria Score Parameters

The urticaria score introduced by Breneman et al. [24], with
slight modification in order to be suitable for scoring PUs, was
used for assessing the severity of the disease. A 4-grade scale was
used for describing the localization, the size of lesions, the duration of lesions, the frequency of episodes and the intensity of pruritus. Localization of wheals was classified as follows: 0 = no
wheals; 1 = wheals were localized to 1 part of the body; 2 = 2-3
parts of the body were involved; 3 = generalized wheals. Average
size of lesions was categorized as follows: 0 = no wheals; 1 = 1
 

Irinyi/Széles/Gyimesi/Tumpek/Herédi/
Dimitrios/Adény/Hunyadi/Szegedi
2.cm; 2 = 3-4 cm; 3 = >4 cm. Average duration of lesions: 0 = no
symptoms; 1 = <60 minutes; 2 = 1-4h; 3 = >4h. The frequency
of lesions was scored as follows: 0 = no wheals; 1 = lesions appearing 2 times a week; 2 = 3 times a week; 3 = >4 times a week. Intensity of pruritus: 0 = none; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe.
Severity of pruritus was measured using a visual, analog 10-point
scale, and the results were converted into the above mentioned 4point scale. By summing up the points we reached the total severity score of a patient.

Autologous Serum Skin Test

The ASST was carried out according to the literature [17]. Positive reaction was defined when the serum-induced wheal was red
and had a diameter that was =1.5 mm wider than the saline-induced response at 30 minutes.

CD63 Surface Expression Assay

The CD63 expression on the surface of donor basophils was
determined as described earlier [20]. Briefly, after incubation
with chronic urticaria sera, the cells were labelled with goat antihuman IgE FITC and R-phycoerythrin conjugated anti-human
CD63 monoclonal antibody (both from Caltag, Burlingame,
Calif., USA) and the percentage of IgE and CD63 double-positive
basophils was measured on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur
flow cytometer. Values above the 95th percentile of CD63-positive cells induced by 20 control sera were considered as positive
(cut-off values were 5.1% for atopic donors (Da) and 2.2% for nonatopic donors (Dya).

Detection of Autoantibodies

Levels of autoantibodies against thyroglobulin (a-TG), thyroid
peroxidase (a-TPO) and extractable nuclear antigen (a-ENA)
were measured by a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA; Hycor Biomedical GmbH, Kassel, Germany) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The serum concentrations of anti-endothelial cell antibody (AECA) was analysed by ELISA (Cogent Diagnostic, Edinburgh, UK) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions [25].

Therapeutical Protocol

All patients got antihistamines as a first line of therapy. Patients
received low-sedation, second-generation H1 receptor antagonist
antihistamine (cetirizine 10 mg/day) monotherapy first. In case of
inadequate response, cetirizine was given in a higher dose (20 mg/
day), then sedative antihistamine (hydroxyzine 25 mg twice a day)
and H2 receptor antagonist (cimetidine 400 mg twice a day) were
combined [26, 27]. We regarded the therapy ineffective if the patient’s severe complaints persisted or the urticaria score index did
not show a reduction of at least 50%. In CIU and AIU patients, a
short course of oral corticosteroid treatment (methylprednisolone
32 mg/day, reduced by 4 mg every 5 days to zero) was used as a second line of therapy. If this therapy resulted only in temporary improvement, cyclosporine (3 mg/kg/day for 3 months) was added as
a third line of therapy for AIU patients [28].

Statistical Analysis

Fisher’s exact test was used to analyse the relationship between
categorical variables. One-way analysis of variance was used to
test for differences in the means of continuous dependent variables broken by the levels of categorical independent variables.

3 subgroups: female/male ratio was 6.9:1 in the AIU group, 2.5:1

significant between the AIU and PU groups (p = 0.009).

Results

Laboratory Tests

Among the 109 patients, 58 (53.2%) had a positive
ASST and 47 (43%) a positive CD63 assay. Positivity of
the CD63 assay was needed for a diagnosis of AIU.

Demographic Data

Among the 109 patients with chronic urticaria, 47 patients (43%) had AIU, 35 (32%) CIU and 27 (25%) PU
(fig. 1). The mean age of patients with chronic urticaria
was 39.8 + 15.8 years (range 13-74). The mean age in the
AIU subgroup was 43.1 + 15.8 years, in the CIU subgroup 38 + 13.7 years and in the PU subgroup 32.7 +
17.8 years. There was no significant difference in the
mean age of the subgroups.

The female/male ratio in the whole group was 3.0:1
(82/27), which meant a statistically significant female
preponderance (p = 0.02). The female/male ratio in the
AIU group was 6.9:1 (41/6), in the CIU group 2.5:1 (25/10)
and in the PU group 1.5:1 (16/11). We found that the female preponderance was significantly different only between the AIU and PU groups (p = 0.009). Among the
female patients, 50% had AIU, 30.5% CIU and 19.5% PU,
while 22.7% of the male patients had AIU, 37% CIU and
40.8% PU (fig. 1).

Evaluation of Urticaria Score Parameters

The localisation of wheals was examined. In patients
with AIU, 93.6% of the cases had symptoms on the whole
body surface, while in the CIU subgroup wheals were
widespread in 85.7% of patients. Among DU patients
7.7% and among CU patients 44.5% had generalized
symptoms. The localization score was 2.6 for AIU patients, 2.0 for CIU patients, 1.23 for DU patients and 1.55
for CU patients (fig. 2). The differences were significant
between AIU and CIU patients (p < 0.001), between AIU
and DU patients (p < 0.001), and between AIU and CU
patients (p < 0.001). We also found significant differences between CIU and CU patients (p = 0.043) and between
CIU and DU patients (p < 0.001). The results showed insignificant differences between CU and DU patients (p =
0.381).

We investigated the duration of wheals (from appearance to vanishing). The mean duration was 9 h in the
AIU subgroup, with a mean score of 2.74. Among CIU
patients, the mean duration of wheals was 4.45 h with a
mean score of 2.14, while for DU patients it was 0.81 h
with a score of 1.0, and 0.79 h with a 1.0 score in CU patients (fig. 2). The results show significant differences between AIU and CIU (p < 0.001), between AIU and DU
(p< 0.001), and between AIU and CU (p < 0.001) patients. Also, differences were significant between CIU
and DU (p< 0.001), and between CIU and CU (p<0.001)
patients. Comparing patients with DU and CU, no significant difference was detected (p = 0.662).

We also measured wheal sizes. The mean size of lesions was 2.36 + 1.54 cm for all patients enrolled. It was

 

220 Int Arch Allergy Immunol 2007;144:217-225

3.1 + 1.8 cm for patients with AIU (score: 1.91), 1.9 + 1.1
cm for patients with CIU (score: 1.3), 2.4 + 1.5 cm for
patients with DU (score: 1.76) and 1.1 + 0.7 cm in CU
patients (score: 1.1) (fig. 2). The differences were significant between AIU and CIU (p < 0.001) and also between
AIU and CU patients (p = 0.015), but the results showed
insignificant differences between AIU and DU patients
(p = 0.672). Comparing CIU to DU patients, the size of
wheals was significantly higher in DU patients (p = 0.035)
and no significant differences were detected between
CIU and CU patients (p = 1.000). The differences were
significant between DU and CU patients (p = 0.038).

The frequency of urticaria episodes showed significant differences between AIU and CIU patients on one
hand (p< 0.001) and between AIU and DU as well as CU
patients on the other (both p < 0.001). Comparing CIU
o DU and to CU patients, we did not find significant differences (p = 0.162 and p = 0.125, respectively) between
he groups. There were no significant differences between
DU and CU patients (p = 1.000). Eighty-five percent of
patients with AIU, 46% of patients with CIU, 15.4% of
patients with DU and 11.1% of patients with CU experienced skin symptoms more than 4 times a week. Accordingly, the frequency of urticaria episodes score for AIU
patients was 2.85, while it was 2.17 for CIU, 1.7 for DU
and 1.7 for CU patients (fig. 2).

We also investigated pruritus. According to the prurius scale, the AIU patients’ mean score was 2.80, while for
CIU, DU and CU patients it was 2.37, 2.0 and 2.1, respecively (fig. 2). The differences were significant between
AIU and CIU patients (p < 0.001), between AIU and DU

patients (p < 0.001) and also between AIU and CU patients (p = 0.001). The pruritus score was significantly
different between CIU and DU patients (p = 0.030), but
no statistically significant difference was found between
CU and DU patients (p = 0.845) and between CIU and
CU patients (p = 0.178).

Total scores counted from the parameters mentioned
above were summed up to give the individual score index
of each patient (the severity of disease). This mean score
index was 12.89 for AIU patients, 9.98 for CIU patients,
7.69 for DU patients and 7.45 for CU patients. The total
urticaria score was significantly different between AIU
and DU patients (p = 0.05), between AIU and CU patients
(p= 0.038) and between AIU and CIU patients (p = 0.013),
but no statistically significant difference was found between CIU and DU patients (p = 0.707) and between CIU
and CU patients (p = 0.336; fig. 3).

Accompanying Diseases and Autoantibodies

Prevalence of urticaria in patients’ families was also
investigated. Twenty-three percent (25/109) of chronic
urticaria patients mentioned the occurrence of some type
of urticaria in their family history. In AIU patients, 48.9%
(23/47) had a positive family history of urticaria, while
this was the case in 5.7% (2/35) of CIU patients and 3.7%
(1/27) of PU patients. This meant a significant difference

The occurrence of these diseases was nearly the same
among AIU, CIU and PU patients.

Twenty-two percent (24/109) of patients reported autoimmune diseases in their history. Autoimmune disease
was present in the history of 51% (24/47) of AIU patients
but not in the history of CIU and PU patients. This meant
a significant difference between these groups (p < 0.001;

21/47), rheumatoid arthritis (4.2%, 2/47) and vitiligo
(17%, 8/47) were associated with AIU.

The presence of autoantibodies was also examined in
all patients. Patients with AIU had a significantly higher
occurrence of autoantibodies against the thyroid gland
than patients with chronic urticaria of any other origin.
We found anti-thyroid autoantibodies (a-TG, a-TPO) in
11% (12/109) of chronic urticaria patients and in 23%
(11/47) of AIU patients. Among CIU patients, we detected a-TPO positivity in only 1 case (2.8%, 1/35), but no
anti-thyroid antibodies were found in the sera of PU patients. This meant a significantly higher occurrence of
anti-thyroid antibodies in AIU than in the other subgroups (p < 0.001). We did not observe any differences
between the subgroups while investigating other autoantibodies (a-ENA and AECA; table 1).

Response to the Therapeutical Protocol
Antihistamine therapy (cetirizine monotherapy, cetirizine higher dose, cetirizine and hydroxizine combina

tion, cetirizine and cimetidine combination) was effective in 45% (49/109) of chronic urticaria patients. To the
first line of therapy, 70.3% (19/27) of PU patients and
68.6% (24/35) of CIU patients responded, in contrast to a
12.8% (6/47) response rate in AIU patients. In the PU
group, antihistamine therapy was equally effective in DU
(77%) and CU (77.7%) patients, but DPU (33%) and cold
urticaria (50%) patients responded poorly. Oral corticosteroids were used in 31.4% (11/35) of CIU patients and
in 87.2% (41/47) of AIU patients, and were found to be
effective in 63.6% (7/11) of CIU patients and 53.6% (22/41)
of AIU patients. Nineteen AIU patients were ultimately
given oral cyclosporine therapy, which relieved the symptoms in 15/19 patients (78.9%; table 2). Corticosteroid
and cyclosporine therapy were not introduced in the PU
patient group.

Discussion

Our current study was aimed at comparing the most
common forms of chronic urticaria (PU, CIU and AIU)
regarding demographic data, urticaria score, accompanying diseases, presence of autoantibodies and the effectiveness of different treatments. In the literature, AIU is
usually defined on the basis of the results of ASST and
HR assay [4, 21], but in our present study the CD63 assay
was used instead of the HR assay. On the basis of recent
investigations, the CD63 expression assay seems to be a
convenient and reliable functional assay in the diagnosis
of AIU, as it is less expensive and less time consuming
than the HR assay [19-22].

Most authors agree that the proportion of PU in chronic urticaria is 30-35%, while AIU represents 27-35% [9,
17]. In the current study of chronic urticaria patients,
43% had AIU, 32% CIU and 25% had PU. This higher
proportion of the AIU group and lower proportion of the
PU group among our patients could be explained by the
fact that mild forms of urticaria were treated by local general practitioners or at dermatology outpatient units.
More severe or treatment-resistant urticaria cases were
generally referred to the allergy follow-up clinic run by
our Department of Dermatology (tertiary care institution).

In our study we found a 75% female preponderance
(3.0:1) in the total chronic urticaria patient group, and an
even more significant female preponderance was detected in the AIU group (87.2%). Several other studies have
confirmed our results. For example, Sabroe et al. [29] also
detected a 61% (66/107) female predominance in the pa
 

Irinyi/Széles/Gyimesi/Tumpek/Herédi/
Dimitrios/Adény/Hunyadi/Szegedi
tient group with autoantibodies, while in the CIU group
73% female patients were found in by others [24].

To assess the severity of disease we applied the urticaria score introduced by Breneman et al. [24] with slight
modifications in order to be suitable for scoring PUs. This
urticaria score for assessing the severity of symptoms was
used not only for the AIU and CIU groups, but also for
the PU group. Because of the heterogeneity of PUs, this
group was further divided into subgroups when urticaria
score was calculated, and only DU and CU patients with
persistent urticaria were compared to AIU and CIU patients. In the case of PU, the urticaria score is generally
difficult to apply, although it can also provide valuable
information about how the disease adversely affects the
quality of life in this subgroup of chronic urticaria patients. In the present study, one of our aims was to determine how symptoms influence quality of life, so we used
a modified urticaria score for the AIU, CIU, DU and CU
groups. According to our results, there were significant
differences in the total score between AIU and CIU patients, between AIU and DU patients and between AIU
and CU patients. Sabroe et al. [29] also demonstrated that
the patients with detectable serum autoantibodies had
significantly higher urticaria scores with more wheals
(p = 0.005), a wider distribution (p = 0.009) and higher
itch scores for the most severe episodes of itching (p =
0.002) than patients without autoantibodies. On the basis
of our results, the CIU group was significantly different
from the CU group with regard to only 2 urticaria score
parameters, while between CIU and DU patients significant differences could be observed with regard to only 4
parameters. Due to this, CIU, CU and DU patients’ total
urticaria scores did not differ significantly, although
some of the parameters were higher in the CIU subgroup.
This insignificant difference may also come from the fact
that only the most severe forms of DU and CU patients
are referred to our department.

Several studies have investigated the presence of different autoantibodies in AIU. Originally, Leznoff et al.
[30] observed an increased incidence of anti-thyroid antibodies (a-TG, a-TPO) in chronic urticaria patients and
since then several groups have detected these types of autoantibodies. In a recent article, Kikuchi et al. [31] found
anti-thyroid antibodies in 27.7% of histamine releasepositive chronic urticaria patients and 10.9% of histamine release-negative patients. In conformity with their
findings we also detected a significantly higher occurrence of anti-thyroid antibodies in the AIU group than
in the other 2 subgroups. However, there is no evidence
that in the presence of both autoimmune thyroid gland

 

Examinations in Chronic Urticaria

and urticaria diseases, the anti-thyroid antibodies have
a pathogenetic role in the development of chronic urticaria. Other authors have demonstrated autoantibodies
against ENA, cardiolipin, 2-glycoprotein, rheumatoid
factor, endothelial cell and myeloperoxidase in chronic
urticaria patients [32-34]. Our results showed no significantly increased prevalence of a-ENA or AECA in either
subgroup of chronic urticaria patients.

Caproni et al. [35] and Sabroe et al. [29] also investigated the presence of atopic diseases and urticaria in the
family or personal history of chronic urticaria patients,
but did not observe significant differences between patients with and without autoantibodies. In the present
study, the occurrence of urticaria in the family history of
AIU patients was significantly more frequent compared
to CIU or PU subgroups. Concerning atopic diseases or
drug allergy, there were no significant differences between the 3 subgroups. Among our chronic urticaria cases we observed drug allergy in 11%, while Humphreys
and Hunter [36] reported a 9.8% frequency in similar circumstances.

Regarding the therapy of chronic urticaria, we applied
a 3-line therapy protocol [2, 11, 27]. All chronic urticaria
patients were treated first with antihistamines (cetirizine
monotherapy at doses of 10 and 20 mg/day, cetirizine and
hydroxizine combined therapy, cetirizine and cimetidine
combined therapy) and 45% (49/109) responded well.
The efficacy of cetirizine monotherapy and cetirizine
and H2 antihistamine combined therapy was investigated independently in several studies. In a study with 97
CIU patients, Handa et al. [37] found cetirizine monoherapy to be effective in 88.4% (51.9% became symptom
free, 36.5% showed partial improvement). On the other
hand, Harvey et al. [38] demonstrated that the hydroxizine-cimetidine combination was favored by 58% of CIU
patients, but the total effectiveness of the different modes
of antihistamine treatments in the 3 subgroups of chronic urticaria was not reported earlier. In our present study,
he first-line therapy was effective in 68.6% of CIU, in
70.3% of PU and in 12.8% of AIU patients, which suggests
hat AIU is not just the most severe form of chronic urticaria, but also responds less to conventional antihistamine therapy.

For patients in whom first-line therapy was ineffecive, oral corticosteroid treatment was started. Seven of
he 11 (63.6%) CIU patients and 22 of the 41 (53.6%) AIU
patients who had to be treated with oral corticosteroids
responded to the second line of therapy. Although there
are no double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of the use
of corticosteroids in chronic urticaria, there is truly no

question regarding their efficacy [39]. Various regimens
of corticosteroid treatment have been suggested in review
articles, but it is usually recommended that H1 receptor
antagonists should be continued and prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be avoided because of side effects
40]. Of the remaining 19 AIU patients not responding to
oral corticosteroids, ciclosporin therapy was introduced
and among them 15 (78.9%) became symptom free. Ciclosporin has been shown to be effective both in antibody-positive and antibody-negative chronic urticaria
patients, and Greaves [4] reported a >75% response rate
with one third of patients remaining in remission, one
third relapsing mildly and one third relapsing seriously
4, 41, 42].

In conclusion, when the CD63 assay instead of the HR
test was used in the diagnosis of AIU, the autoimmune
form was also found to be the most severe form of chronic urticaria, as it was shown in earlier studies when the
HR assay was utilised [29]. These results also support our
previous findings that the CD63 assay is a reliable test in

 

the diagnosis of AIU. When comparing clinical parameters between ASST-positive and ASST-negative groups
of CIU patients, Nettis et al. [43] did not find significant
differences between the subgroups and concluded that
ASST cannot be used alone either to predict the severity
of urticaria or to define it as autoimmune. On the other
hand, there was no significant difference between the
CIU, DU and CU subgroups in their total urticaria score
and in their response to antihistamine therapy. Other
forms of urticaria were observed significantly more frequently in the family history of AIU patients, while in
their personal history autoimmune disease occurred
more often.
