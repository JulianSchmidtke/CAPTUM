Background Histamine-releasing activity (HRA) is detectable in up to 50% of patients with chronic
ordinary urticaria.

Objectives To determine the effect of cyclosporin on clinical features and HRA in patients with
chronic urticaria.

Methods Thirty patients with severe unremitting disease, responding poorly to antihistamines
and showing a positive autologous serum skin test (ASST) as a marker of HRA, were randomized to
4 mg kg! daily of cyclosporin (Sandimmun®, n = 20) or placebo (n = 10) for 4 weeks. Nonresponders were offered open-label cyclosporin for 4 weeks. All were followed for up to 20 weeks or
until clinical relapse; all took cetirizine 20 mg daily throughout the study. The primary measure of
efficacy was a daily urticaria activity score (UAS) of weal numbers and itch (maximum score 42 per
week). A positive response was defined as a reduction to < 25% of baseline weekly UAS and relapse
as a return to > 75%. The effect of cyclosporin on serum HRA was assessed by in vitro basophil
histamine release assays and ASSTs before and after treatment.

Results Twenty-nine patients (19 active, 10 controls) completed the randomized trial medication.
Eight of 19 on active treatment but none on placebo had responded at 4 weeks (P < 0:05). Three
others on active drug met the criterion for response at 2 weeks but not at 4 weeks. Mean
reduction in UAS between weeks 0 and 4 was 12:7 (95% confidence interval, CI 6:6—18°8) for
active and 2:3 (95% CI — 3:3-7-9) for placebo (P = 0-005). Seventeen non-responders (seven
randomized to active and 10 to placebo) chose open-label cyclosporin and 11 responded after 4
weeks. Six of the eight randomized active drug responders relapsed within 6 weeks. Of the 19
responders to randomized and open-label cyclosporin, five (26%) had not relapsed by the study endpoint. Mean in vitro serum HRA fell from 36% (95% CI 22-49%) to 5% (95% CI 1-8%) after
cyclosporin treatment (n = 11, P < 0:0001). The ASST response to post-treatment serum was also
reduced (P < 0:05).

Conclusions This study shows that cyclosporin is effective for chronic urticaria and provides
further evidence for a role of histamine-releasing autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of this chronic
‘idiopathic’ disease.

Key words: autoantibodies, chronic idiopathic urticaria, cyclosporin, randomized controlled trial

Chronic ordinary urticaria is called ‘idiopathic’ if no
physical, allergic, infectious, drug-related or vasculitic
cause can be identified. The presence of histaminereleasing autoantibodies to the high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) or, less often, to IgE, in the sera of 30-50%
patients with chronic ‘idiopathic’ urticaria’~° identifies
a subgroup with a probable autoimmune aetiology.

Routine laboratory assays for these autoantibodies are
not yet available but the autologous serum skin test
(ASST) is a reasonably sensitive (about 70%) and
specific (about 80%) marker.”

Antihistamines remain the cornerstone of chronic
urticaria management, although some patients derive
little or no benefit from them. Cyclosporin inhibits cellmediated immunity by downregulating Thl lymphocyte responses and T cell-dependent antibody formation

Camberley, U.K.) have shown encouraging results in
severe chronic ‘idiopathic’ urticaria.!°-!?

Subjects and methods
Patients

Thirty patients who had had severe daily or almost
daily chronic ‘idiopathic’ urticaria for over 6 weeks
(median duration 12 months, range 3-192; median
age 33 years, range 19-72; 24 women) were recruited
from urticaria clinics at the St John’s Institute of
Dermatology (n = 20) and general dermatology clinics
at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital (n = 10) between
1992 and 1996. All had a positive ASST as an entry
requirement (see Skin tests) and a poor response to
antihistamine therapy. Eighteen had required prednisolone for their urticaria at some time before the
study, reflecting the severity of their disease. The
baseline characteristics of the patients are summarized
in Table 1.

Exclusion criteria were: chronic urticaria due to
predominantly physical causes, urticarial vasculitis and
Cl esterase inhibitor deficiency; known transmissible
viral infections; known malignant disease including
skin cancer; use of systemic steroids within 2 weeks of
entry; use of antihypertensives, potentially nephrotoxic
drugs and other drugs known to interfere with the
pharmacokinetics of cyclosporin; a history of epilepsy,
drug or alcohol abuse; pregnancy, lactation or risk of
pregnancy without medically approved contraception;
hypertension (diastolic blood pressure > 95 mmHg);
serum creatinine, potassium or uric acid above the
upper normal limits; bilirubin or liver enzymes more
than twice the upper normal limit.

Design of study and randomization

The study was a randomized, prospective comparison
of cyclosporin (Sandimmun®) 4 mg kg™! daily with
identical-appearing soft gelatin capsules containing
placebo over 4 weeks following a 1-week assessment
period during which patients started (or continued)
cetirizine 20 mg daily (UCB Pharma Ltd, Watford, U.K.)
and completed baseline assessments of urticaria
activity. Skin tests and pre-entry blood tests were
done at week — 1. Sera were stored in sterile aliquots at
— 70 °C for repeat skin testing and in vitro histamine
release studies. A clinical assessment, blood count and
biochemical profile were done at weeks 0 and 2.
Responders at week 4 were entered into the follow-up
phase of the study and reviewed at 2-week intervals
for a month, then monthly until either relapse,
discontinuation at the patient’s request, or reaching
the maximum study duration of 6 months. Nonresponders at week 4 were offered open-label cyclosporin and followed in the same way. Cetirizine was
given during the baseline and placebo phases because
of the severity of the urticaria and was maintained
throughout the study for comparability of the urticarial
activity assessments. There are no known interactions
between cetirizine and cyclosporin.

Randomization codes were generated using a
randomization schedule generator written in SAS® by
Novartis AG using the SAS Macro facility. The macro
utilized information on the number of centres, number
of patients per centre, preferred block size, number and
type of treatments and treatment ratios to produce the
randomization schedule. Once generated, the code was
sent to the Research and Development Department in
Horsforth, U.K. for the production of the drug labels
and code break envelopes. The code break envelopes
were only to be opened if the health of the patient was
threatened or the future management would be
affected, and this was not the case for any of the
patients recruited into the study.

Dose modification and withdrawals

The protocol specified a 25% dose reduction of cyclosporin for the following events: increase of serum
creatinine 30% above baseline value, serum potassium
above the normal range, increase in total serum
bilirubin or liver enzymes by > 100% or to twice the
normal ranges, or diastolic blood pressure > 95 mmHg
on two consecutive visits. A further 25% dose reduction
was applied if the abnormality persisted.

RCT OF CYCLOSPORIN IN CHRONIC URTICARIA 367

Withdrawal from the study was occasioned by a
rise of serum creatinine to above twice the upper
normal limit, occurrence of any event specified under
‘Exclusions’, lack of response or clinical relapse.
Patients who left the study for other reasons were
classed as discontinued.

Assessments and criteria for response and relapse

Patients completed a daily record for the preceding
24 h of small (diameter <3 cm) and large (> 3 cm)
weal numbers, scored as follows: 0, < 10 small weals;
1, 10-50 small weals or <10 large weals; 2, > 50
small weals or 10—50 large weals; 3, almost covered.
Severity of itch was scored as 0, none; 1, mild; 2,
moderate; 3, severe. The possible weekly aggregate
urticaria activity score (UAS) therefore ranged from 0
to 42. Patients also completed a 10-cm visual analogue
score (VAS) at each visit indicating the overall severity
of their urticaria over the previous 2 weeks from 0
(none) to 10 (worst ever).

Response was defined as a reduction of the weekly
UAS to < 25% of baseline and relapse as a return of the
UAS to > 75% of baseline.

Skin tests

Cetirizine was discontinued at least 48 h before skin
testing. Fifty-microlitre aliquots of autologous serum,
saline and histamine (10 1g mL”! histamine base in
saline) were injected intradermally into clinically
uninvolved volar forearm skin. A positive ASST was
defined as a 30-min pink weal of diameter = 1-5 mm
than a saline control skin test. A positive response
provides evidence of histamine-releasing activity (HRA)
in the serum.’ Histamine served as a positive control.

All patients had a positive ASST as a condition of
entry for the study. Only 19 were skin tested with
freshly drawn serum at baseline (week — 1). The others
were tested with serum stored at — 70 °C from an
earlier venesection due to an unplanned protocol
difference between the two centres. The median
interval between taking blood and skin testing at
baseline in these patients was 6 weeks (range 1-28).
Only those skin tested with fresh sera at baseline were
included in the pre- and post-treatment comparisons in
case the levels of serum HRA had changed during the
storage interval.

ASSTs were performed with stored baseline serum on
the last day of cyclosporin administration (week 4, or
week 8 for open-label treatment), and the results

compared with the week — 1 skin test response to look
for any changes in skin mast cell ‘releasability’. They
were repeated 2 weeks later (when cyclosporin was
expected to have been eliminated from the skin) with
stored baseline serum and freshly drawn serum, to look
for changes in HRA during treatment.

Histamine release assays

Sera were assayed for HRA on the well-characterized
basophils of two donors, as described previously.
Basophils from these donors were selected on the
basis of their responsiveness to anti-FceRI and anti-IgE
autoantibodies. Maximum histamine release was used
for analysis of pre- and post-treatment serum HRA.
Histamine release >5% was considered positive.
Assays were done on baseline sera, 2 weeks after
finishing cyclosporin, and during follow-up in selected
cases. They were not done on sera taken while patients
were on cyclosporin in case basophil histamine release
was inhibited.®

Routine laboratory investigations

Baseline investigations in all patients included a full
blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR),
biochemical profile, antinuclear antibody (Hep 2 assay)
and C4 component of complement (as a screen for
Cl esterase inhibitor deficiency). Blood count and
biochemistry were repeated at each visit until the
follow-up phase of the study. Plasma cyclosporin levels
were measured at weeks 4 and 6 for responders to the
trial medication and at weeks 8 and 10 for nonresponders treated with open-label cyclosporin, to
check compliance with medication and residual levels
at the time of skin testing. Normal therapeutic ranges
were 80-160 pg! at the Norfolk and Norwich
Hospital, and 70-180 pg L | at the St John’s Institute
of Dermatology. The results were not available to
clinicians or patients when the decision was taken to
give open-label cyclosporin to non-responders on
completion of the 4-week randomized trial medication.

Statistical analysis

The main analysis of efficacy was restricted to the first
4 weeks when all subjects were on randomized blinded
trial medication. Analysis of covariance employed a
correction for age, sex and baseline activity.'*!> The

was used to show the proportion of patients not
achieving a reduction of weekly UAS to <25% of
baseline at each assessment up to 10 weeks. Frequency
of responses was analysed with x? using Yates’s
correction. Differences in VAS and pre- and posttreatment data on ASSTs and serum HRA were
analysed by Student's t-tests after checking for normal
distribution of data.

Ethics approval

The study was approved by the ethics committees of the
West Lambeth Health Authority and the Norwich
Health District. All patients gave written informed
consent.

Results

Clinical response to randomized trial medication
(weeks 0-4)

Twenty-nine patients completed the randomized
4-week trial medication and were followed up (Fig. 1).
Eight of 19 subjects who received active therapy
responded at 4 weeks whereas none of the 10 placebo
subjects did so (P < 0-05). Three additional patients

receiving active drug met the criterion for response
at 2 weeks but not at 4 weeks. One of these had low
plasma cyclosporin levels at week 4 and subsequently
responded to open-label cyclosporin, so may have
complied poorly with the trial medication.

Mean reduction in UAS from baseline at 4 weeks
was 12-7 (95% confidence interval, CI 6:6—18-8) for
patients randomized to active medication and 2:3 (95%
CI — 3:3 to 7-9) for placebo (Fig. 2) (P = 0-005). The
reduction in VAS at 4 weeks for active (mean 3-0, 95%

and placebo capsules, and this improvement was
sustained during active treatment (Fig. 3). Urticarial
activity ceased within as little as 48 h in six patients.

in this study) who would need treatment (NNT) with
cyclosporin to achieve one response at 4 weeks was 2:4

cyclosporin for 4 weeks and 11 (four active, seven
placebo) responded.

Overall response to randomized and open-label cyclosporin
(weeks 0-8)

The overall response rate to randomized and/or openlabel cyclosporin was 19 of 29 (65%). Survival analysis
for time to first response showed a large difference
between active and placebo treatments in the first 4
weeks of the study, followed by convergence as nonresponders were put on open-label cyclosporin (Fig. 4).
Five of the 19 responders (26%) were still clear or
almost clear at 6 months.

Withdrawals, discontinuation and dose reduction

As shown in Figure 1, one patient on active medication
discontinued the study after 2 weeks. This was because
she felt unwell and her urticaria had not responded.
She was excluded from the subsequent analysis. Six of
the eight active trial drug responders relapsed after
stopping therapy (two within 2 weeks, two within 4
weeks and two within 6 weeks) and were withdrawn.
One active trial drug responder discontinued the study
at her own request after 4 weeks. One responder to
open-label cyclosporin discontinued the study at 10
weeks while still in remission because she moved
abroad; another failed to complete the open-label
cyclosporin. A 25% dose reduction was made for
hypertension in two patients, severe paraesthesiae
in one and hypoglycaemic episodes in an insulindependent diabetic.

Side-effects

Side-effects during cyclosporin treatment were common
but not severe enough to require withdrawal from the
study. Twenty-nine of the 30 patients reported symptoms which were probably or definitely drug-related:
tingling of the fingers, feet or lips (n = 15); gastrointestinal upset (n = 11); headache (n = 12, severe in
three); feeling ‘light headed’ (n = 2); tiredness (n = 9);
general malaise (n = 2); ‘flu-like symptoms’ (n = 3);
upper respiratory tract infections (n = 2); arthralgia
(n = 4); backache (n = 2); leg cramps (n = 2); swollen
or bleeding gums (n = 3); hypertrichosis (six women:
two, upper lip; two, face; two, face and body); and one
each with loin pain, breast tenderness, exacerbation of
scalp hair loss, and possible increase in growth rate
of scalp hair. Five patients noted side-effects during

medication and six placebo. There was no significant
difference in baseline serum responses or histamine
weal diameters between the two groups (Table 2). The
response to fresh serum skin-tested 2 weeks after
stopping cyclosporin was significantly lower than the
response to stored pretreatment serum skin-tested on
the same day (2:1 mm, 95% CI 1:0-3°3, vs. 4:8 mm,
95% CI 2:4—7:2, P = 0:04, n = 13), consistent with a
reduction in serum HRA. However, the response to
serum skin-tested at week — 1 and the response to the
same (stored) serum after 4 weeks on cyclosporin
showed no statistical difference, suggesting that
cyclosporin had no effect on skin mast cell
‘releasability’.

Basophil histamine release assays

Baseline sera were available for in vitro analysis from 27
subjects. The mean highest histamine release of these
sera was 20:4% (95% CI 10:8-29-7), of which 14
released > 5% histamine (mean 36:7%). There was no
significant difference between HRA of sera randomized
to the active vs. the placebo groups (Table 2). Paired
pre- and post-treatment sera were available for analysis
in only 11 of the 14 patients with positive HRA. They
showed a highly significant fall in mean HRA from 36%
(95% CI 22-49%) to 5% (95% CI 1-8%) (P < 0-0001,
Fig. 5).

Relationship between basophil histamine release and clinical
response

Thirteen of 18 clinical responders to cyclosporin in
whom baseline serum HRA was available for assay
were positive (> 5%) compared with one of nine nonresponders (P < 0-01). All 11 patients included in the
analysis of pre- and post-treatment paired sera were
clinical responders. Their mean UAS fell from 23-6
(baseline) to 1:2 (post-treatment). The relationship of
clinical activity to serum HRA is shown for four
patients who responded to cyclosporin and were
followed for 16 weeks (Fig. 6a—d). UAS and HRA
corresponded quite closely during relapse (Fig. 6a,b)
and sustained remission (Fig. 6c,d).

Discussion

This study provides strong evidence that cyclosporin
may bring about clinical improvement in chronic
ordinary urticaria patients with a positive ASST.
Disease control was achieved in about two-thirds of

patients and long-term improvement in a quarter of
these. Three of the five responders who completed the
study without meeting the criteria for relapse continued to have mild disease, which suggests either that
cyclosporin can, in some instances, reset urticaria to a
lower level of activity, or that the patients underwent
spontaneous improvement. The 68% overall response
rate to open cyclosporin reported by Toubi et al.'" is
similar. They used 3 mg kg! daily of Sandimmun® for
6 weeks followed by 2 mg kg”! daily for 3 weeks, then
1 mg kg™! daily for 3 weeks. Eleven of 13 responders
remained in remission 3 months later. Barlow et al.
used 2:5-3:5 mg kg! daily of open Sandimmun® for
4 weeks, with a response rate of 75%.'° Seven of
nine responders had some beneficial effects at least
1 month later. Similar results have been obtained by
Vena et al.'7'? The presence of a positive ASST
response offers a marker for histamine-releasing autoantibodies, but does not appear to be a prerequisite for
a good clinical response to cyclosporin, as 10 patients
with a positive ASST did not respond in this study and
seven of the responders reported by Toubi et al. had
negative pretreatment serum skin tests;!! however, the
in vitro HRA of their sera was not reported.

Fewer adverse events might have been encountered
with a smaller dose of cyclosporin. Toubi et al. reported
only mild side-effects in two of 19 patients (slight
increase of creatinine in one and agitation with
sleeplessness in another), using a starting dose of
3 mg kg~! daily.!! The optimal dose and duration of
cyclosporin in chronic ordinary urticaria still needs to
be established. Treatment with the new microemulsion
formulation of cyclosporin (Neoral®, Novartis Pharmaceuticals) might allow lower doses to be given, as a
comparison between Neoral® and Sandimmun® in
chronic psoriasis showed similar disease control with
an overall 10% dose reduction on Neoral®.'®

The low levels of cyclosporin detected in two patients
2 weeks after finishing the prescribed medication were
unexpected because cyclosporin should be effectively
cleared within five half-lives of stopping treatment
(6-20 hours). It is possible that they did not adhere
strictly to the prescribed dose of trial medication or that
detectable levels were due to slow elimination. One of
the two patients relapsed at week 8, while the other
was still in remission at the close of study (week 24).

The reduction in in vitro serum HRA after cyclosporin in the responders and the reduced ASST
responses to post-treatment sera indicate that
histamine-releasing autoantibodies may be directly
involved in disease pathogenesis, and support the

372 C.E.H.GRATTAN et al.

concept of autoimmune urticaria. The rate of fall is not
known because serial measurements of serum HRA
were not made during cyclosporin treatment.

It is possible that the very early cessation of wealing
in some patients (within 48 h) was due to other factors,
such as stabilization of histamine release, which has
been shown in vitro for healthy human basophils* and
skin mast cells? pretreated with cyclosporin and
stimulated with anti-IgE. Our study showed no
evidence of a reduced skin test response to stored
serum in the presence of cyclosporin, just as Munro
et al. found no reduction in allergen-induced wealing in
atopic eczema patients treated with cyclosporin,!?
suggesting that cyclosporin does not suppress the
acute manifestations of cutaneous mast cell degranulation in vivo. Evidence from the mouse indicates that
cyclosporin can inhibit IgE-dependent tumour necrosis
factor (TNF)-a secretion from skin mast cells and can
reduce the responsiveness of target cells to TNF-a,
leading to inhibition of neutrophil accumulation after
degranulation.”° Cyclosporin also inhibits the release of
cytokines and granular proteins from eosinophils?!
that are often present in lesional urticaria biopsies.
