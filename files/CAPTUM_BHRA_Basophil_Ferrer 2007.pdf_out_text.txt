INTRODUCTION

Chronic urticaria can be defined as the occurrence
of widespread daily or nearly daily wheals for at least
6 weeks’, which may be accompanied by angioedema. While the wheals are transient, the resolution of
angioedema is slower and could take up to 72 hours.
The natural course of chronic urticaria is self-limited,
with spontaneous remissions and occasional relapses’. We recently calculated a 0.6 % (95 % Cl: 0.4-0.8)
prevalence in a population study’.

Chronic urticaria has a considerable impact on patients’ quality of life*®. In a recent national survey on
patients attending an Allergy Department, chronic urticaria was the disease with the greatest impact on
quality of life of all the allergic diseases. Furthermore,
these patients may undergo extensive laboratory
evaluations seeking a cause only to be frustrated
when none is found.

There is no curative treatment for this disorder and
we do not understand the mechanisms that lead to
the onset of disease. However, in recent years there
have been significant advances in the understanding
of some of the molecular mechanisms that cause cutaneous inflammation that is manifest as urticaria
and angioedema. In this review we will summarize
our recent contributions to this field and try to offer
insights regarding future directions for research.

Malmros® was the first to report the ability of autologous serum to elicit a positive skin test, yet his
report published in 1946 was largely forgotten. In
1982 when Leznoff et al reported a 15 % prevalence
of antithyroid antibodies in patients with chronic urticaria’ a role for autoimmunity in disease pathogenesis was again considered. Later observations reported a 5-10 % incidence of functional anti IgE
antibodies again suggesting that autoimmunity might
have a role® in the disease. Then the autologous skin

test was reexamined? and was found to be positive
in a significant subpopulation of patients with chronic
urticaria. The next development was by Greaves and
co-workers'® who demonstrated the presence of
functional autoantibodies against the alpha subunit of
the IgE receptor in at least one third of patients. Kaplan and coworkers®"' corroborated basophil activation through the alpha subunit of the IgE receptor
and subsequently found the presence of these IgG
antibodies in the sera of about 40 % of patients with
chronic urticaria'?. 60 % of patients’ sera are negative
and these remain idiopathic.

Anti IgE receptor antibodies (and anti IgE) are able
o cause the release of histamine and other media‘ors which are responsible for urticaria and angioedema by activating blood basophils and cutaneous mast
cells'*'%. The functional activity of these autoantibodies is augmented in the presence of components
of the classical complement cascade" with a critical
role for C5a’®.
This ability to activate basophils and mast cells can
be confirmed either by the autologous skin test® or
by the ability of serum to degranulate these cells in
vitro. The basophil histamine release assay appears
‘0 be the “gold standard” for detecting functional auoantibodies in the serum of patients with chronic
urticaria since we found both false negative and positive results by binding assays'®'®. Results could be
optimized by preincubation of basophils with IL-3
which augments histamine release without affecting the percentage of positive sera’’.

Sabroe et al'® compared functional and non functional sera and found that sera which were unable to
activate basophils were not able to activate mast
cells either. Thus their lack of activity is not caused by
unresponsive basophils. The only difference found
was that those patients with functional antibodies
had higher severity scores and more intense inflammation on skin biopsy.

The presence and probable role of IgG autoantibodies directed against epitopes expressed on the alpha-chain of the IgE receptor and to lesser extent to
IgE in a subset of patients is generally acknowledged. Recently evidence that supports this conclusion'? includes demonstration that sera of chronic
urticaria patients induce basophil expression of
CD203c”°, CD63?', as assessed by Flow cytometry,
and this expression does correlate with histamine release.

It has also been reported that some patients with
chronic urticaria have IgG antibodies against the
eosinophil low affinity IgE receptor (CD23) which activates eosinophils and then causes histamine release?> by ECP, MBP or other eosinophil cationic proteins. However this has not yet been confirmed.

Autoimmunity is also supported by observations
such as a higher frequency of HLA class DR4 and
DQ8 alleles seen in patients with chronic urticaria
consistent with a predisposition to this disease** dependent on immune response genes.

MEDIATOR PRODUCTION FROM MAST CELLS
AND BASOPHILS UPON SERA STIMULATION

We first stimulated human skin mast cells and basophils with chronic urticaria sera in order to assess
IL4 production, and related the results to plasma IL4 levels.

When we stimulated basophils from a normal
donor with sera from chronic urticaria patients, we
observed that those patients whose sera were able
to activate basophils and induce histamine release,
were also able to induce IL4 production. In contrast,
when we incubated sera from patients lacking the
ability to stimulate histamine release, we could not
detect IL4 in the supernatant after incubating with
the same basophils.

Leukotriene production by cutaneous mast cells
and Leukotriene production by basophils were closely correlated when each cell type was incubated with
the same chronic urticaria sera. Thus sera that activate basophils, also activate mast cells, which is consistent with earlier data regarding histamine release'*. We observed higher serum leukotriene
concentrations in those patients whose urticaria is
associated with angioedema compared to sera from
patients with only urticaria, however the difference
did not reach statistical significance. There were no
significant differences between these latter groups
with regard to histamine release. There was also no
difference in their ability to induce either histamine
release or Leukotriene production upon incubation of
patients’ sera with basophils, rather than mast cells.

Our data lend further support to the presence of
basophil and cutaneous mast cell activators, predominantly anti FceRI"®, in the sera of patients with
chronic urticaria and that such sera can lead to the
production of leukotrienes and IL4 as well as histamine. Antibody to the IgE receptor is clearly correlated with the ability to induce IL4 release since the
same sera that activate basophils and induce histamine release also induce IL4 production.

Our results also provide clues to explain the presence of a perivascular cellular infiltrate that differentiates chronic urticaria from other types of urticaria
such as dermographism?®?’. The serum factor is responsible not only for histamine release, but also
C5a, cytokines, and presumably chemokines all of
which contribute to the recruitment of cells”8?°.

TH 1 OR TH2 PHENOTYPE

We next questioned whether the sera of patients
with chronic urticaria reflect predominance of a
Th1 or Th2 phenotype. We initially approached this
objective by determining the cytokine profile in the
sera of patients with chronic urticaria. We measured
INFgamma as a representative of a Th1 profile, and
we measured |L4 and IL5 as representative of a
Th2 subtype. We found that IL4 was higher in the
sera of patients with chronic urticaria (as well as
atopic subjects) compared to controls while IL5 and
FNy levels were normal.

We then studied cytokine expression at the single-cell level? and identified the T cell subpopulations
involved in cytokine production employing anti-cyokine monoclonal antibody (MoAbs) and flow cyometry. Thus we could assess the simultaneous
production of different cytokines in the same cell.
We found significant differences in the ability of
CD4+ lymphocytes to produce IL4 and INF gamma
upon PMA-lonomycin stimulus when healthy conrols are compared to chronic urticaria patients. There
was no difference in IL4 or INFgamma production
by CD8+ lymphocytes of patients vs. controls. We
did not find significant differences when comparing
he ratio of INF-gamma/IL4 production by CD4+ or
CD8+ lymphocytes of controls and urticaria patients.
The cytokine profile found in our study does not relect either a Th1 or Th2 predominance.

These data again strengthen an immune basis for
chronic urticaria, since we demonstrate that CD4+
lymphocytes of patients with this disease are activated and they release greater amounts of cytokine with
a non-specific stimulus. On the other hand, this finding is similar to a study in which the cellular infiltrate
associated with chronic urticaria had a ThO profile®'.
The authors analyzed skin biopsies of chronic urticaria patients by in situ hybridization. IL4, IL5 and
INF-gamma revealed higher cytokine m-RNA expression in chronic urticaria patients than in healthy controls, without a predominance of either a Th1 or
Th2 representative cytokine.

 

 

 

STUDY ON RELEASABILITY OF CHRONIC
URTICARIA BASOPHILS

Most studies have focused on the properties of
chronic urticaria sera, but few studies have compared basophils (or mast cells) derived from chronic urticaria patients to basophils derived from normal donors. Prior reports demonstrated that
basophils of patients have a diminished response
to anti-lgE°*** but no differences in releasability

was found with stimuli such as fMLP, A23187 and
PAF*®.

We examined the response of basophils of
healthy donors, atopic donors and patients with
chronic urticaria to a variety of stimuli including
anti-IgE, bradykinin®®, MCP-19”, C5a"41©38, and serum.

When we stimulated basophils of chronic urticaria
patients (CU basophils) with anti-IgE and compared
the results with histamine release upon stimulation
of basophils from healthy controls with anti-lgE, we
observed a significantly decreased histamine release
in CU basophils and to a lesser degree with C5a. No
differences were observed when basophils from patients were incubated with bradykinin or MCP-1°°.

Furthermore, we divided chronic urticaria sera in
two groups, one whose serum was able to activate
normal basophils and therefore believed to be autoimmune, and the group lacking this ability, designated chronic idiopathic urticaria. We compared histamine releasability when these sera are incubated
with basophils derived from patients with chronic urticaria.

Surprisingly, we observed a much greater histamine release when basophils of CU patients were
stimulated with other chronic urticaria patients’ sera
compared to healthy basophils stimulated with CU
sera. Moreover, even those sera that were not able
to activate healthy basophils were highly active on
CU basophils. Control sera were also able to activate CU basophils but not healthy basophils.

Hence, chronic urticaria basophils, in spite of being
less responsive to some stimuli, are clearly highly
responsive when incubated with sera; even normal
sera. Chronic urticaria basophils have several specific features that distinguish them from basophils of
healthy donors or atopic controls. They are less respondent to anti-IgE and C5a with no difference when
stimulated with bradykinin and MCP-1 and have
much higher release when incubated with serum.
The factor in serum that stimulates these cells has
not been identified nor is the abnormal responsiveness of the cells understood.

 

 

CONCLUSION

There is increasing evidence in favour of an autoimmune mechanism as a cause of chronic urticaria in
40-45 % of patients. Autoimmunity is dependent on
the presence of IgG antibody to the alpha subunit of
the IgE receptor, and to a lesser degree anti-IgE. Such
sera release histamine, leukotrienes, IL4 and induce
CD203C and CD63 expression on donor basophils.

There remains a substantial group of patients in
whom it is not possible to demonstrate this autoim

60 Ferrer M et al CHRONIC URTICARIA: WHAT IS NEW, WHERE ARE WE HEADED

mune mechanism. Yet we demonstrate similar abnormalities in both groups. They share abnormal responsiveness with basophils of patients with chronic
autoimmune urticaria, just as the histology of the two
groups is strikingly similar?"“°.

On the other hand, stimulation of T lymphocytes
releases both IL4 and INF-y and the histology of biopsy specimens does not have a predominance of Th1
or Th2 subtypes although most cells are CD4 positive rather than CD8 positive.

Finally we can conclude that chronic urticaria basophils have several specific features that distinguish
them from basophils of healthy donors or atopic controls. They are less responsive to anti-lgE and C5a
with no difference when stimulated with bradykinin
and MCP-1 and have much higher release when incubated with serum. The factor in serum that stimulates these cells has not been identified nor is the abnormal responsiveness of the cells understood. One
study has, however, suggested a signal abnormally
involving Ras in chronic urticaria basophils*".

These findings do not yet lead to a particular therapy although use of cyclosporine, particularly in the
autoimmune subgroup may have a rationale related
to the above observations*?:**. However, they offer
better understanding of the physiopathology of this
disease, that help to avoid unnecessary laboratory
tests and provide both to the patient and to the
physician new perspective and research possibilities.
