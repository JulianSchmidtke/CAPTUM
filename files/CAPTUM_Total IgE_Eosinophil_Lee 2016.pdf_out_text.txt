Abstract

Background: Clinical presentation of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs exacerbated respiratory disease

(NERD) is found to be heterogeneous. This study classified phenotypic clusters to determine NERD subtypes.

Methods: We performed 2-step cluster analysis using urticaria, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), and atopy, in a
NERD cohort comprising 302 patients. Asthma exacerbation was defined as receiving at least 1 burst of
intravenous steroid treatment and/or at least 2 bursts of oral steroid use (= 45 mg/3days) per year. The

possession rate of anti-asthmatic medications was estimated during the follow-up period.

Results: There were 4 subtypes; subtype 1 (NERD with CRS / atopy and no urticaria), subtype 2 (NERD with
CRS and no urticaria / atopy), subtype 3 (NERD without CRS / urticaria), and subtype 4 (NERD with urticaria).
Significant differences were found between the 4 subtypes in the female proportion, baseline FEV1%, serum
total IgE level, and sputum/peripheral eosinophil count. A higher frequency of asthma exacerbations was noted
in subtype 1 compared to subtype 3. The possession rates of medium to high dose ICS/LABA showed
significant differences among the 4 subtypes. Metabolomic analysis showed that the 4 subtypes of NERD had a
higher serum LTE4 level than those with aspirin-tolerant asthma. The patients with subtypes | and 3 had a

higher urine LTE4 level than those with subtype 2.

Conclusion: We found 4 distinct subtypes with different clinical/biochemical findings and asthma
exacerbations in a NERD cohort. These findings suggest that stratified strategies by applying subtype

classification may help achieve better outcomes in the management of NERD.

Key words: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs exacerbated respiratory disease; cluster; stratified medicine.

Introduction

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs exacerbated respiratory disease (NERD), which is characterized by
severe bronchoconstriction in response to aspirin and/or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID),
is a subtype of asthma with approximately 7% prevalence among adult asthmatics (1-4). Even without
aspirin/NSAID ingestion, NERD presents as severe and chronic inflammation in the upper and lower airways
requiring higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and oral corticosteroids (OCS), which represents poorly

controlled asthma (5, 6). Management of NERD is diverse and more often includes a combination inhaler of

medium to high dose ICS/long acting beta)-agonists (LABA), leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA), and
intranasal steroids for NERD patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and aspirin desensitization (7). In
addition, systemic steroids can be used to control clinical symptoms following asthma exacerbations and severe
CRS cases. Considering that the prevalence of severe asthma is higher in NERD patients than in non-NERD
patients (8-10), management of NERD patients have focused on reductions in asthma exacerbations,
hospitalization, and high dose ICS/OCS requirement. The clinical features of NERD include middle-age onset,
female predominance, and common comorbid conditions, including CRS (5-7). NERD patients present as
moderate to severe asthma, in which eosinophils are activated in the upper and lower airway mucosae (11, 12).
Compared to aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA), NERD is less associated with atopy; however, atopy is often

present in patients with NERD (7, 13, 14).

The clinical courses of NERD are found to be variable (15). Drug responses to LTRA in NERD patients are
inconsistent and almost same to aspirin tolerant patients (16), although overproduction of cysteinyl leukotrienes
(Cys-LTs) is the major pathogenic mechanism of NERD (17). Through Th! and Th2 immune responses, the
HLA allele of DPB1*0301 is associated with the NERD phenotype (18). NERD patients showed a greater
decline in FEV1% after aspirin challenge, a lower methacholine PC, and a higher prevalence of CRS/nasal

polyps and urticaria compared to ATA (19, 20).

To the best of our knowledge, there has been a published report to demonstrate subphenotypes of NERD in a

Polish cohort (21), where definite criteria to discriminate each subphenotype were not reported clearly. In this
study, we aimed to classify the phenotypic clusters of NERD showing difference in terms of clinical features,
inflammatory cells, and metabolomic profiles, as well as asthma exacerbations and anti-asthmatic medication

requirements.

Materials and Methods

Study subjects

A total of 302 adult patients with NERD, who were monitored for more than 1 year, were recruited between
January 1996 and July 2013 at Ajou University Hospital, Suwon, South Korea. The mean follow-up time was
7.2 5.2 years (min-max, | - 19 years). The diagnosis of NERD was based on a positive response to the lysine
aspirin bronchoprovocation test (Lys-ASA BPT), which was performed according to the previously described

method (22). For metabolomic analysis, 94 ATA patients were enrolled as controls. ATA was defined if a
patient had asthma, but showed negative results to Lys-ASA BPT, or denied any changes in upper and lower

respiratory symptoms after ingestion of aspirin/NSAID.

Initial data collected

Atopy was defined as a positive skin test response (Allergen/Histamine ratio > 2+) to at least 1 common inhalant
allergen among pollens, animal dander, mold, and house dust mites (Allergopharma, Reinbek, Germany). CRS
was defined as an inflammatory condition involving the paranasal sinuses or nasal polyps that lasts 12 weeks or
longer, with positive CT findings. Severe CRS was defined as >10 Lund-Mackay (LM) score on the basis of
OMU-CT findings. Sixty two (20.5%) of 302 NERD patients had various kinds of urticaria. When urticaria was
defined following the classification proposed by Kowalski et al (23), 28 (9.3%) had NSAIDs-exacerbated
cutaneous disease (NECD), 15 (5.0%) had NSAIDs-induced urticaria-angioedema (NIUA), and 19 (6.3%) had
other types of urticaria including physical urticaria or histories of urticaria induced by foods and others. Changes
in FEV1% after Lys-ASA BPT were recorded up to 7 hours from pre-challenge FEV 1% at initial visit (24). The
methacholine provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1% (PC) was also collected. The HLADPB1*0301 allele was analyzed by a high-resolution technique as previously described (25). The levels of
serum total IgE and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) were measured using the UniCAP system ( Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Sputum and peripheral blood were collected from the patients when
they had a stable disease with regular medication. Induction and processing of sputum were performed as
previously described (26, 27). In addition, peripheral eosinophils were isolated from red blood cells and
granulocyte fractions by an eosinophil isolation kit and MACS column (MiltenylBiotec Inc., Auburn, CA, USA)
(28). The proportions of eosinophils and neutrophils were determined by cell differential count. Serum periostin

levels were measured using ELISA as previously described (29).

Analysis of medication records

During the follow-up period, electronic medical records were summarized each year from the first visit of each
patient. Then, the records were condensed depending on the history of at least 1 systemic steroid treatment

and/or at least 2 bursts of oral steroid use at a prednisone-equivalent dose of > 45 mg for 3 days to treat asthma

exacerbations per year. The possession rates of anti-asthmatic drugs, including ICS plus LABA and ICS alone,
were the proportion of prescription days per year. High dose ICS was estimated to be more than 1000 mcg of
fluticasone per day, and medium dose ICS were estimated to be between 500 and 999 mcg of fluticasone or

equivalent doses per day.

Measurement of leukotriene E4 (LTE4) metabolite in serum and urine

Peripheral venous blood and urine were collected in the morning from stabilized patient who had been
maintaining anti-asthmatic medications. They stopped leukotriene modifiers for at least 14 days prior to the
measurement. Serum samples were extracted with 80% methanol, and urine samples were diluted 5 times with
water. All the samples were mixed for 10 min and centrifuged at 18,341 g for 20 min at 4°C. Five microliters of
each sample were injected into the column held at 40°C and eluted with 0.1% formic acid and 20 mM
ammonium formate in water (solvent A), and 0.1% formic acid in methanol (solvent B) over 21 min. Each
metabolite was eluted at a constant flow rate of 0.4 ml/min using the following gradient: 2% - 98% B from 0.1
to 13 min, and 98% B held constant for 2 min followed by a return to 2% B from 15.1 to 17 min.
Chromatographic separation of metabolites in serum and urine was performed with ACQUITY UPLC BEH
C18, 2.1x50 mm, 1.7 pm (Waters, Milford, MA) analytical column using the Agilent 1290 Infinity II UHPLC

system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).

Each eluent was introduced into an Agilent 6530 quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer. The
overall quality of the analysis procedure was monitored using repetition of a pooled serum or urine sample. The
following deuterated internal standards were used; leukotriene E4-d5 for LTE4 (Cayman Chemical Company,
Ann Arbor, MI, USA). In urine samples, creatinine was quantified to normalize to the actual concentrations of
each biomarker and 1, 3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and used as the internal
standard for creatinine. The concentration of each biomarker was determined from the calibration curves using
linear regression analysis. Correlation coefficients determined were > 0.99 for individual biomarkers. All

chemicals were of HPLC grade.

Cluster analysis

To classify phenotypic clusters in NERD, we performed 2-step cluster analysis (30). We considered 7
parameters (clinical and genotypic criteria), including FEV1%, methacholine PCy), HLA-DPB1*0301 allele,
total IgE, atopy, CRS, and urticaria at first visit day. In 2-step cluster analysis, a precluster was obtained at the
first step according to the sequential clustering approach, and its subclusters were taken at the second step as
input and then grouped them into the desired number of clusters with the Bayesian Information Criterion.
Goodness of cluster solution measured a silhouette coefficient which is close to the maximum value 1. We
selected 3 clinical criteria for phenotypic clusters, which had the highest quality (0.7 silhouette measure of
cohesion and separation), as atopy, CRS, and urticaria. According to the importance, we obtained the decision

tree using atopy, CRS, and urticaria and identified 4 phenotypic clusters as subtypes.

Statistical analysis

Clinical characteristics of the subtypes were examined by the Fisher exact test and ANOVA with Tukey using
SPSS version 23.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics, IBM Corporation, Chicago, IL, USA). Pearson’s correlation was used
for serological markers. The serum and urine levels of LTE4 were applied to a generalized linear model with log
transformation. For repeated measurements from accumulated medication, a generalized estimating equation
was applied to calculate odds ratio for asthma exacerbations and possession rate of anti-asthmatic drugs in
individual subtypes. The forest plot presented odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). To verify
granulocyte features between eosinophils and neutrophils, radar plots presented the relative position among the
NERD subtypes with respect to the rate of eosinophilia and neutrophilia in peripheral blood and sputum. A P

value of < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results

Phenotypic clusters of NERD

Three nodes (importance: urticaria = 1.00, CRS = 0.77, and atopy = 0.57) were located on decision tree
according to the relative importance (Fig. 1). Consequently, NERD was found to have 4 distinct subtypes:

subtype 1 (NERD with CRS / atopy and no urticaria, n = 83, 27.5%), subtype 2 (NERD with CRS and no

urticaria / atopy, n = 84, 27.8%), subtype 3 (NERD without CRS / urticaria, n = 73, 24.2%), and subtype 4
(NERD with urticaria, n = 62, 20.5%). Prevalence of CRS, atopy and urticaria were summarized in Table 1.
Prevalence of severe CRS / nasal polyps was 47.0% / 65.1% in subtype 1, 34.5% / 64.3% in subtype 2 and
27.4% / 35.5% in subtype 4, while no one in subtype 3 had CRS or nasal polyps. Table 1 summarizes the
differences in clinical findings among the 4 subtypes. The mean age of asthma onset ranged from 40.30 + 14.81
to 43.86 + 13.05 years, without significant differences among the 4 subtypes. The female proportions were
found to be 53.0% in subtype 1, 73.8% in subtype 2, 64.4% in subtype 3, and 61.3% in subtype 4 (P = 0.047),
showing that the female proportion was significantly higher in subtype 2 than in subtype 1 (P = 0.006). There
was a significant difference in baseline FEV1% between subtypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 (P = 0.008), while asthma onset
age, follow-up period, duration of asthma, FEV1% fall after Lys-ASA BPT, or methacholine PC) level were
not significantly different among the 4 subtypes. No significant differences were noted in the prevalence of

HLA-DPB1*0301 allele among the 4 subtypes (P = 0.241).

Comparison of inflammatory and immunologic profiles among the 4 subtypes

Table 2 presents the differences in immunologic and cellular markers among the 4 subtypes. Peripheral and
sputum eosinophil counts were significantly different among the 4 subtypes (P < 0.001 and P = 0.040,
respectively); higher peripheral serum and sputum eosinophil counts were noted in subtypes 1 and 2.
Additionally, the prevalence of peripheral eosinophilia (> 400/uL) and sputum eosinophilia (> 3%) were higher
in subtypes 1 and 2 (P < 0.001 and P = 0.033, respectively). However, there were no significant differences in
sputum neutrophil counts. Fig. 2 illustrates a radar chart analyzing relative positions of peripheral and sputum
eosinophilia/neutrophilia, in which subtypes | and 2 shows relatively higher peripheral/sputum eosinophilia
than the other subtypes; however almost similar sputum neutrophilia was noted among subtypes 1, 2, and 3.
There were significant differences in serum total IgE levels among 4 subtypes (P < 0.001). There were no
significant differences in serum periostin levels among 4 subtypes (P = 0.769). However, a significant positive
correlation between serum periostin levels and peripheral eosinophil counts was found in subtype 1, not in the
remaining 3 subtypes (Pearson’s correlation; r = 0.265, P = 0.003 in total NERD patients, r = 0.514, P = 0.001
in subtype 1, r = 0.074, P = 0.643 in subtype 2, r = 0.359, P = 0.072 in subtype 3, and r = 0.308, P = 0.213 in

subtype 4; data not shown).

Comparison of serum and urine LTE4 metabolite levels

Fig. 3 presents serum and urine LTE4 metabolite levels among 4 subtypes of NERD compared to ATA. In 4
NERD subtypes and ATA, serum LTE4 levels were 19.72 + 12.35, 16.91 + 8.32, 22.93 + 23.78, 16.65 + 6.58,
and 13.59 + 10.10 pg/ml, respectively, and urine LTE4 levels were 4.03 + 7.18, 0.82 + 1.35, 5.71 + 8.78, and
2.25 + 2.37, 1.18 + 1.59 ng/mg creatinine, respectively. For statistical analysis, log transformation was used to
normalize LTE4 levels. The serum LTE4 levels were significantly higher in all the subtype of NERD than in
ATA (P < 0.001, P= 0.010, P = 0.004, and P = 0.021, in subtype 1, 2, 3 and 4 vs. ATA, respectively).
Compared to ATA, a significantly higher urine LTE4 level was noted in subtype 1 (P = 0.038), while subtype 3
tended to show a higher serum LTE4 level (P = 0.100). However, compared to subtype 2 in NERD subtypes,

significantly higher urine LTE4 levels were noted in subtypes | and 3 (P = 0.017 and P = 0.035, respectively).

Comparison of medication requirements and asthma exacerbations

Fig. 4 depicts the risk of asthma exacerbation and anti-asthmatic medication use among the 4 subtypes. Subtype
1 showed a higher asthma exacerbation rate than the remaining 3 subtypes (OR = 2.144 [1.112, 4.132]) with a
statistically significant difference between subtypes 1 and 3 (P = 0.023). Asthma exacerbation frequency of
subtype 2 tended to be higher that of subtype 3 (P = 0.114, OR = 1.746 [0.875, 3.484]). The possession rates of
medium to high dose ICS/LABA were significantly higher in subtypes | and 2 than in subtypes 3 and 4. These
trends remained unchanged even after high dose ICS/LABA was analyzed separately, which showed significant
differences in comparison of subtype! vs. 3, subtype | vs. 4 and subtype 2 vs. 3. The possession rate of ICS
monotherapy was significantly higher in subtype 3 (subtype | vs subtype 3, P = 0.035; subtype 3 vs subtype 4,
P =0.042). In 4 NERD subtypes, mean value of the possession rates of each anti-asthmatics were 59.6 + 39.0%,
50.0 + 39.1%, 35.5 + 37.9%, and 36.9 + 38.7% of ICS/LABA (medium to high dose); 15.7 + 32.7%, 9.5 +
24.0%, 3.3 + 13.5%, and 4.9 + 19.2% of ICS/LABA (high dose); 7.3 + 19.5%, 7.7 + 20.5%, 15.1 + 28.8%, and
7.5 + 18.3% of ICS monotherapy, in subtype 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. There were no significant differences in

short-acting beta agonist use between the 4 subtypes (data not shown).

Discussion

Several investigators have reported distinct subtypes of asthma using cluster analysis in a cohort of adult
asthmatics, which suggests that asthma is a heterogeneous disease and that a stratified approach is needed for
each subtype (21, 31). A recent report in a Polish NERD cohort has suggested that NERD has unique subphenotypes with heterogeneous clinical features using latent class analysis (21). However, in the present study,
we identified 4 phenotypic clusters in NERD with applying 2-step cluster analysis using 3 representative
phenotypes, including urticaria, CRS, and atopy. This is the first study to demonstrate the 4 distinct subtypes of
NERD with specific clinical criteria and long term clinical courses. Each subtype showed distinct features in
terms of the female proportion, the degree of eosinophilia, LTE4 metabolite levels, asthma exacerbation, and
severity. It is well known that NERD occurs more commonly in females, especially in middle-aged women (7,
11). In the present study, although the female proportion was higher in total NERD patients, it showed
significant differences among the 4 subtypes; the highest female proportion was noted in subtype 2 (73.8%),
followed by subtypes 3 (64.4%), and subtype 4 (61.3%). The male to female proportion was almost the same in
subtype 1 (females, 53.0%). Anti-asthmatic drug requirements and asthma exacerbations were compared by
analyzing all the electronic medical records for maximum 19 years, and significant differences were noted
among the 4 subtypes. These findings suggest that 4 unique phenotypic clusters of NERD according to the
presence of urticaria, CRS, and atopy can be applied in clinical practice to predict the clinical features and

courses of individual NERD patients.

It is widely accepted that eosinophils are a major inflammatory cell in upper (CRS/nasal polyps) and lower
airways of NERD patients (32). Peripheral eosinophilia is found in more than 50% of NERD patients and
correlated with the severity of CRS (33, 34). A high peripheral eosinophil count is associated with airflow
restriction, severe symptoms, and frequent asthma exacerbations. ICS and intranasal steroids are used to control
upper and lower airway inflammation (35, 36). Suppression of peripheral eosinophils has shown to improve
asthma symptoms and to prevent asthma exacerbations (37). In the present study, the overall prevalence of CRS
in NERD patients was 65.2%; all the subtype 1 or 2 patients had CRS, while none of the subtype 3 patients and
48.4% of the subtype 4 patients had CRS. Moreover, mean peripheral and sputum eosinophil counts were
higher in all the NERD patients, both of which were significantly higher in subtypes | and 2, indicating that
subtypes! and 2 may represent the clinical phenotype of NERD as previously described by Samter’s triad (11).

In subtype 1, all the patients were atopic; therefore, the allergen-Th2-driven pathway could be a major

mechanism for the activation of eosinophils. However, subtype 2 patients were all non-atopic, but had CRS with
higher peripheral and sputum eosinophilia. A recent review has demonstrated that LTD, and PGD, triggered by
respiratory infections or air pollutants could activate type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), subsequently leading
to the activation of eosinophils (38), which suggests that ILC2-driven eosinophil activation may play a major
role in the airway inflammation of subtype 2 of NERD. These findings indicate that mechanisms for eosinophil
activation may vary according to the subtypes of NERD, which should be further investigated to better control
the upper and lower airway inflammation of NERD. In the present study, the degree of sputum neutrophilia was
similar among subtypes 1, 2 and 3. However, subtype 3 showed relatively lower peripheral and sputum
eosinophil counts with similar sputum neutrophil counts compared to subtypes | and 2, and none of them had
CRS. Since mechanisms for neutrophil activation are not completely understood in NERD, further studies on
anti-IL17 antibody may be needed to control neutrophilic inflammation (39). Atopy is a predisposing factor for
adult asthma and aspirin-induced urticaria (40). In the present study, the atopy rate and the total IgE level were
higher in subtype 1 (100%) than in subtype 2. The atopy rates in subtypes 3 and 4 were 60.3% and 64.5%,
respectively. These findings suggest that atopy may contribute to the induction of Th2-driven eosinophilic
inflammation in subtypes 1, 3 and 4. Further investigations are needed to understand the mechanisms for

eosinophil and neutrophil activations according to the each subtype of NERD.

It is well known that NERD patients are significantly associated with acute/chronic urticaria (40, 41). In the
present study, the overall prevalence of urticaria was 20.5%, in which NECD was found in 9.3% and NIUA was
found in 4.9%, and none of patients in subtypes 1, 2 and 3 had urticaria. Moreover, lesser asthma severity and a
lower frequency of asthma exacerbations were observed in subtype 4. As compared to the remaining 3 subtypes,
subtype 4 patients had a lower peripheral eosinophil count and a lesser drug requirement with higher FEV1%
value. These findings suggest that compared to the other subtypes, subtype 4 is a unique subtype of NERD.
Considering that mast cells are a major effector cell in NECD, NIUA and other types of urticaria (40) and that
atopy is a predisposing factor for both NECD and NIUA (42), these findings suggest that atopy could contribute

to mast cell activation which may play a major role in urticaria development in subtype 4.

It has been reported that NERD present with moderate to severe asthma (40, 41). Patients with a higher
endoscopy score of the para-nasal sinuses, a lower lung function, a higher blood eosinophil count, and a more
frequent OCS/ICS use suffer from more frequent asthma exacerbations (43). In the present study, although

subtypes, the baseline FEV1% value was lower in subtypes 1, 2 and 3 compared to subtype 4. The frequency of
asthma exacerbations and anti-asthmatic medication requirements, including medium to high dose ICS/LABA,
were higher in subtype | and 2 patients. This may be associated with a significantly higher peripheral and
sputum eosinophil counts, and higher prevalence of CRS in subtype | and 2 patients, because all the subtype |
or 2 patients had CRS as a major comorbid condition which could have affected asthma exacerbations.
Moreover, compared between subtype | and 2 patients, all the subtype | patients had atopy, which could have
affected poor asthma control and frequent exacerbations. These findings suggest that clinical severity and
courses differ between the 4 subtypes of NERD: subtype | and 2 patients could present with more severe
clinical course due to frequent asthma exacerbations and require high dose anti asthmatic medications, including
ICS and systemic steroids, to control their symptoms, while subtype 3 and 4 patients may have a less severe
clinical course with less frequent asthma exacerbations and drug requirement. To reduce asthma exacerbation
and minimize systemic steroid use in subtypes | and 2 patients, further interventions with applying biologics are

needed to improve their control status,

The present study compared 2 known biomarkers, serum periostin and HLA DPB1*0301, among the 4 subtypes
of NERD. The serum periostin level is reported to be a significant serum biomarker predicting the phenotype of
NERD compared to ATA (29). However, we could not find any significant differences among 4 subtypes. A
significant correlation between the serum periostin level and the peripheral eosinophil count was noted only in
subtype 1. The prevalence of HLA-DPB1*0301, which is a significant gene marker of NERD, did not
significantly differ among the 4 subtypes, suggesting that serum periostin and HLA-DPB1*0301 may not be
biomarkers differentiating the 4 subtypes of NERD. Next, we compared the serum and urine levels of LTE4
metabolite levels. Compared to ATA, significantly higher serum LTE4 metabolite levels were noted in the 4
subtypes of NERD, while no significant differences were noted among the 4 subtypes. However, significantly
higher urine LTE4 metabolite levels were noted in subtypes | and 3 than in subtype 2, indicating that
leukotriene overproduction, a key finding of NERD, is more prominent in subtypes | and 3. Previous studies
have suggested that asthmatic patients having higher urinary LTE4 levels respond to leukotriene modifiers (7,
17). Although sample size are not large enough to evaluate their clinical significance, these findings suggest that
the serum LTE4 metabolite level may be a potential serum biomarker for differentiating NERD from ATA
among asthmatic patients, while the urine LTE4 metabolite level may be a useful biomarker for differentiating
subtypes 1 and 3 among NERD patients and that leukotriene modifiers may be more beneficial to control airway

inflammation in these two subtypes. Stratified strategies can be employed in the management of NERD patients

on the basis of clinical, cellular, and biochemical measures, especially serum and urine LTE4 metabolite levels.
Further studies on the pathogenic mechanisms for each subtype are needed to elucidate new targets for
individual subtypes. The limitation of this study is smaller sample sizes for the measurement of serum and urine
LTE4 metabolite levels, however, it was validated in a second cohort of asthma patients. In addition, this is the
largest cohort of NERD comprising 302 NERD patients who were confirmed by positive L-ASA BPT result.
This is the first study to compare all the clinical, cellular, and immunologic findings, as well as two biomarkers,
the mean frequency of asthma exacerbation and anti-asthmatic medication requirements per a year among the 4

subtypes of NERD for the follow up period of each group.

In conclusion, we demonstrated the 4 distinct subtypes of NERD by applying 2-step cluster analysis. Each
subtype showed different clinical/cellular/biochemical findings and asthma severity/exacerbation. It is
concluded that stratified strategies according to subtype classification may help achieve better clinical outcomes

in the management of NERD.
