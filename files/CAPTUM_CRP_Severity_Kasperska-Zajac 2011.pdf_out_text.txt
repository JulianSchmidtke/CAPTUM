Summary

Background Our previous study was the first to demonstrate enhanced plasma IL-6
concentrations in chronic urticaria (CU). It is known that C-reactive protein (CRP) is a
sensitive marker of an underlying systemic inflammation, triggered mainly as a response to
IL-6.

Objective To evaluate plasma IL-6 concentration in CU patients relating to the clinical disease
activity and serum CRP concentration.

Methods Serum CRP and plasma IL-6 concentrations were measured in 58 CU patients and 30
healthy subjects. Ten CU patients were evaluated twice, during the active period as well as
upon the spontaneous clinical remission of the disease. CU activity was assessed with the use
of the symptom scores recommended by EAACI/GALEN/EDF guidelines.

Results IL-6 and CRP concentrations were significantly increased in CU patients as compared
with the healthy subjects, whereas they decreased remarkably upon the spontaneous
remission. IL-6 concentration was associated with weekly urticaria activity scores and also
significant differences were found between patients showing different degrees of urticarial
activity. Significant correlation was observed between IL-6 and CRP concentrations.
Conclusions and Clinical Relevance This study reinforces evidence that, apart from a local
cutaneous inflammation, CU is associated with a systemic inflammatory response. Such
acute-phase response is manifested by increased circulating IL-6, which varies along with
CRP changes and may be related to the urticarial activity.

Introduction

divided according to the degree of their urticarial activity
[8]. To gain some better insight into the significance of

Chronic urticaria (CU) is associated with mast cell activation accompanied by inflammatory response, which may
be manifested by increased serum concentration of Creactive protein (CRP) [1-3]. CRP is a sensitive systemic
marker of inflammation and tissue damage, produced
mainly in the liver, responding to IL-6. IL-6 is believed to
be the central regulator of the immunological and inflammatory processes and in humans the cytokine is elevated
in many inflammatory diseases [4-7].

So far, only scarce research has associated the systemic
inflammatory response with CU. Our previous minor study
suggested that plasma IL-6 concentration is significantly
increased in CU patients; however, the patients were not

IL-6, it would be interesting to know whether plasma IL-6
concentration is associated with any clinical activity as
well as serum CRP concentration in CU. Moreover, only
some studies were devoted to the outcome of blood
quantitative or qualitative abnormalities upon inactive
CU. Therefore, we have designed another part of the study
to verify whether CU patients in complete clinical remission, receiving no treatment, continue to show increased
plasma IL-6 concentration. Taken together, we measured
plasma IL-6 concentration in CU patients in the active
stage and upon clinical remission to evaluate then any
possible association with serum CRP concentration as well
as clinical activity scores.

Methods and materials

Subjects

Fifty-eight patients (15 men and 43 women; median age
AO years) with CU were selected for the study. Ten patients
had concomitant dermographism. In all cases, any known
causes of CU were ruled out by appropriate investigations.
Each patient underwent the following routine laboratory
tests: full blood count, urine analysis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CRP, serum glucose, hepatic functions,
and creatinine examination. In addition, stool examination for parasites, hepatitis serology (anti-HCV, HBsAg),
rheumatoid factor, antistreptolysin-O, Igs, complement,
antinuclear and antithyroid microsomal antibodies, thyroid function tests (TSH and free thyroxine-fT4), chest
X-ray, and abdominal ultrasonography were performed.

The Helicobacter pylori infection was excluded upon the
negative results of H. pylori antigen stool test and/or rapid
urease test performed during gastrofiberoscopy. Gastrofiberoscopy was performed in patients showing positive
gastric symptoms and/or a positive result of H. pylori
antigen stool test. Our centre does not perform routinespecific IgG and IgM antibodies evaluation for H. pylori in
serum (ELISA test); the reasons are limitations of the
method itself as well as lack of our own relevant experience. Three patients had a positive result of the test
(performed in another clinic) as well as concurrent gastric
ailments, while gastrofiberoscopy proved no H. pylori.

All the patients showed active urticaria at the time of
assessment and were divided into subgroups according to
their urticarial activity as well as autologous serum skin
test (ASST) response.

It should be mentioned that our patients underwent a
panel of extensive tests that are normally not recommended as routine screening for patients with CU. However, taking into consideration a specific objective of our
study, such a strong selection of CU patients was demanded in order to eliminate some processes, which not
only condition the occurrence of CU but may also effect in
elevated concentration of inflammatory mediators. This
could then obstruct proper interpretation of the results.

Assessment of urticaria activity scores

Urticaria activity score (UAS) was calculated as recommended by EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF guidelines [9] and as
earlier described by Maurer group [10]. Weekly UAS was
estimated according to the number of weals and pruritus
intensity, which had appeared during a week before and
on the day of blood sampling, applying the following
scheme: no weals=0, 1-10 weals=1, 11-50 weals=2,
>50 weals=3 and pruritus intensity: no=0, mild=1,
moderate = 2, severe = 3. UAS scores: daily (minimum = 0;
maximum =6) and weekly by adding the daily score

values (minimum=0; maximum=42). Consequently,
weekly UAS were graded as follows: 0-14 (mild), 15-29
(moderate), and 30-42 (severe).

Our study comprised 25 patients with mild CU, 19
patients with moderate CU, and 14 patients with severe
utricaria symptoms as per the weekly UAS. Patients with
severe CU represented a group that before the test showed
highly intensified symptoms, only hardly controlled by
overstandard doses of antihistamines (20 mg of levocetirizine or desloratadine).

In addition, 10 out of 58 CU patients were classified for
the second stage of the study performed upon the clinical
remission. Remission was defined as the absence of any
urticaria symptoms without medication applied during at
least two consecutive months.

H1 and H2 antihistamine drugs were withdrawn at least
10 days before blood sampling. No patient had been
taking corticosteroids or immunosuppressant drugs for at
least 6 weeks.

None of the patients had associated chronic inflammatory disorders or a history of recent acute infectious
disease (1 month before) or any other factors, which could
have influenced the marking scores.

Thirty sex-matched, age-matched, and BMI-matched
healthy subjects formed the control group.

All the subjects submitted respective written consent
and the study was approved by the University Committee
of Ethics.

Blood collection

All blood samples were obtained between 7:00 and 9:00
hours by anticubital puncture. EDTA was used as an
anticoagulant.

Assay of interleukin-6

Plasma IL-6 concentration was determined by ELISA
(R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA), according to
the manufacturers’ protocol. The intraassay and interassay CV were 4.2% and 3.3% for IL-6. Sensitivity of the
assay was 0.70 pg/mL.

Assay of C-reactive protein

Serum CRP concentration was measured by the turbidimetric latex agglutination method (CRP-Latex, BioSystems
SA, Barcelona, Spain) with a detection limit of 1.0 mg/L.
Elevated serum CRP was defined as higher than 5.0 mg/L.

Autologous serum skin test

Intradermal ASST was performed following the method
by Sabroe et al. [11]. Serum-induced weal of diameter
greater by at least 1.5mm than that of a control weal
1388 A. Kasperska-Zajac et al

 

induced by physiological saline was accepted as positive.
Skin prick test with 10mg/mL histamine served as a
positive control.

Statistical analysis

Results are expressed as median and interquartile ranges.
Because data were not distributed normally, non-parametric tests were used. The Kruskal-Wallis variance analysis was used for screening differences between the
groups. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare
data between the patient groups and the healthy controls.
The Wilcoxon’s paired test was used to evaluate differences within the same group. Spearman’s rank test was
used for correlations. A probability value of P<0.05 was
assumed to be significant.

Results

Plasma interleukin-6 concentration and correlation with
urticaria activity score

Plasma concentration of IL-6 was significantly higher in
CU patients as compared with the healthy subjects (median: 1.85 vs. 1.1 pg/mL; P<0.001) (Fig. 1). There were
significant differences in plasma IL-6 concentration between the CU patients with mild, moderate, and severe
symptoms (median: 1.2 vs. 1.9 vs. 3.3 pg/mL, respectively;
P<0.05 and <0.001) (Fig. 2). Concentration of this
cytokine in mild CU grup did not differ significantly as
compared with the healthy subject (Fig. 2).

Plasma IL-6 concentration showed significant correlation with the disease activity as assessed by calculating
the cumulative UAS during 7 days before blood sampling
(r=0.638, P<0.0001) (Fig. 3).

to CU patients with moderate or severe symptoms,
serum CRP concentration in mild CU group did not
differ significantly as compared with the control group
(Fig. 5).

Serum CRP concentration was significantly correlated
with the disease activity as assessed by weekly UAS
(r=0.714, P<0.0001).

(median: 3.95 vs. 4.07 mg/L; P> 0.05).

In the statistical analysis, CRP concentration below the

Analysis of serum C-reactive protein concentration in
chronic urticaria patients, considering the disease activity
and normal laboratory values

Along with the increasing CU activity (from mild to
severe), a greater share of patients showed the CRP values
above the upper limit of the normal laboratory range
(>5 mg/L) (Table 1). Most of the CRP values exceeding the
normal range upper limit were observed in severe CU
(78.6% patients); however, this was not the case in all
patients. Three patients of this group (21.4%) showed the
CRP value within the normal laboratory range. Furthermore, in two out of 25 (8%) of the mild CU group and in

eight out of 19 (42%) of the moderate CU patients, the CRP
values were confirmed beyond the upper limit.

In nine out of 25 (36%) of the mild CU patients, the CRP
values were below the detection limit (< 1 mg/mL), which
was not the case in any of the patients with severe disease
activity (Table 1).

Correlation between plasma interleukin-6 and serum Creactive proteinconcentrations

Significant correlation was noted between circulating
concentration of IL-6 and CRP (r=0.859, P<0.0001) in
CU patients.

Changes in plasma interleukin-6 and serum C-reactive
protein concentration during the active phase of the
disease and upon remission

Plasma IL-6 and CRP concentrations in CU patients upon
remission were significantly lower as compared with active
CU (P<0.05) and did not differ significantly from the
healthy subjects. Individual changes in plasma IL-6 concentration in CU patients during the active phase of the disease,
compared with the remission phase are shown in Fig. 6.

Discussion

Very little is known about the role of IL-6 in urticaria. Until
now, increased local activity of IL-6 has been observed in
the skin of patients with delayed pressure urticaria [12] and
chronic idiopathic urticaria [13]. In addition, elevated
circulating IL-6 has been found in acute urticaria [14].

In the present study, plasma IL-6 concentration was
significantly higher in CU patients as compared with the
healthy controls. There was a significant correlation
between IL-6 concentration and the clinical activity score
of urticaria (weekly UAS) and also some significant
differences were found between patients showing different degrees of urticaria activity (mild, moderate, and
severe) according to weekly UAS. Such association with
the urticarial activity scores indicates a potential role of
IL-6 as a marker of the urticarial activity. Nevertheless, an

extensive study should be performed to determine a
normal laboratory range for IL-6 in a given population.

No significant differences were found between ASSTpositive and ASST-negative CU patients. A negative ASST
has a strong negative predictive value for the presence of
circulating histamine-releasing autoantibodies, whereas
positive ASST indicates the autoimmune/autoreactive
origin of CU [15]. Therefore, the observation of raised IL6 concentrations independent of ASST positivity suggests
that in CU an elevated IL-6 plasma concentration reflects
the inflammatory process independent of the involvement
of autoimmune/autoreactive phenomena.

Significantly lower plasma IL-6 concentration in CU
patients during spontaneous remission as compared
with the active phase of the disease has been observed.
In addition, respective values did not differ significantly from those of the healthy subjects. Therefore,
we suggest that elevated IL-6 concentration characterizes
the active phase of CU as much as the cytokine behaving dynamically during the clinical course of the
disease.

Interestingly, IL-6 directly and CRP by activating the
complement pathway may induce the expression of the
tissue factor [16, 17]. It is known that the tissue factor
pathway of coagulation/fibrinolysis cascade is activated
in CU, which parallels the disease activity [1, 3, 18, 19].
Taking this into account, the relationship between the
coagulation/fibrinolysis markers and IL-6 concentration
should be investigated.

The source of IL-6 in CU has not been identified. Mast
cells and other inflammatory cells types identified in skin
biopsies of CU patients, including monocytes, basophils,
eosinophils, activated T cells, and neutrophils release this
cytokine [4, 7, 13, 16]. Thus, elevated IL-6 is likely to
result from the activation of different inflammatory cells
involved in urticarial processes, especially the mast cells.
So far, it has been suggested that the increased number of
tryptase-positive, chymase-negative mast cells in the

 

lesioned skin of CU may be an important source of IL-6
and IL-5 [13].

We also do not know whether IL-6 is released from the
site of the urticarial inflammation into the bloodstream
and/or released by the circulating inflammatory cells.
Interestingly, up-regulation of IL-6 mRNA in peripheral
blood mononuclear cells of patients with acute urticaria
has been demonstrated [20].

In our study, the serum concentration of CRP was
significantly increased in CU patients, which is consistent
with results of the previous studies [8]. In addition,
significant correlation was observed between IL-6 and
CRP concentrations in the CU patients. Studies of a variety
of diseases have consistently pointed to the correlation
between the circulating IL-6 and CRP. However, elevated
IL-6 concentrations were not always accompanied by the
increased CRP, for e.g. in lupus [4]. In our previous study,
we did not find any significant correlation between IL-6
and CRP in CU; however, the study was limited by a small
number of subjects [8].

Interestingly, some correlation was found between CRP
and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) concentrations
in active period of the disease [3, 10]. Therefore, it should
be asked whether there is any relationship between the
concentration of circulating MMP-9 and IL-6 in CU.

Similar to IL-6 behaviour, the CU patients have raised
serum CRP concentration correlating with the weekly UAS
and there were significant differences between the CU
patients with mild, moderate, or severe symptoms, but
not between mild CU and the control group. None of
the patients with severe urticaria showed CRP scores below
the detection limit. On the other hand, in three out of 14
patients with severe CU, CRP concentrations did not exceed
the normal value. Thus, despite severe disease activity, CRP
concentration can remain within the normal laboratory
range. In addition, two out of 25 patients with mild CU had
CRP values above the upper limit of the normal laboratory
range. Such observations may restrict the clinical usefulness
as a biomarker for the disease activity in individual patients.
However, even in patients showing the values within
the normal range during the symptomatic period, they
decreased below the detection limit upon remission. It
should be emphasized that there are some individual
differences in acute-phase inflammatory marker responses
to different stimuli. This was confirmed by our study where
at the same UAS degree, very high individual differences
were observed in CRP and IL-6 values.

Taken together, more severe CU in most cases is
characterized by systemic inflammatory process, indicated by the increased circulating CRP and accompanied
by parallel changes in IL-6 concentration. Such a pattern
is compared with other chronic inflammatory disorders.
The CU patients may then require a more thorough
evaluation and more extensive therapy, including corticosteroids or immunosuppressants.

Assuming also that CRP is a very powerful predictor of
future cardiovascular events in healthy adults, even a
slight elevation in the CRP baseline concentration is
enough to increase significantly the risk of a cardiovascular disease [21, 22]. We should test whether CU patients
who show stronger inflammatory response are more
vulnerable to possible future cardiovascular disease or
dysregulation of the existing disorders. It seems especially
important in long-lasting severe CU disease.

In conclusion, the study has been the first one to show
that increased plasma IL-6 concentration is a transient
and reversible phenomenon accompanying CU, occurring
during the active period, withdrawn upon remission of the
disease, and correlated with the urticarial activity scores.
Moreover, the observed association between plasma IL-6
and serum CRP concentrations indicates that elevated IL-6
is reflected in increased CRP concentration.

Clinical relevance

The study brings stronger evidence to prove that apart from
a local inflammation, CU is associated with a systemic
inflammatory response. Such acute-phase response is manifested by increased circulating IL-6, which varies along with
CRP changes and may be related to the urticarial activity.

Whether the circulating IL-6 contribute to the pathogenesis of CU or is merely a secondary consequence, calls
for future investigation. It would be interesting to determine whether blocking of IL-6 action in severe CU may
have any beneficial effect.
