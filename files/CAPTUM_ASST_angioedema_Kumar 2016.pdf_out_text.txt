Abstract

Background: Chronic urticaria (CU) is defined as urticaria persisting daily or almost daily for more than 6 weeks and affecting
0.1% of the population. Mast cell degranulation and histamine release ate of central importance in the pathogenesis of CU. About
40-50% of the patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) or chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) demonstrates an immediate
wheal and flare response to intradermal injected autologous serum. This led to the concept of autoimmune urticaria (AIU). Aims: To
determine the occurrence, clinical features, associated clinical conditions, comorbidities of AIU, and to compare this with CSU.
This study aimed to find the frequency of autologous serum skin test (ASST)-positive patients among patients with CSU and to
identify the clinical and laboratory parameters associated with positive ASST and to compare the treatment outcome. Materials
and Methods: A prospective correlation study in 110 patients with CSU was conducted, after screening 200 CU patients attending
the outpatient Department of Dermatology during from January 2012 to May 2013. Patients were subjected to ASST, complete
blood counts, urine routine examination, liver function tests, renal function tests, thyroid function tests (T3, T4, and TSH), and
urine analysis. Results: Out of 200 CU patients screened, 90 patients had excludable causes based on detailed history and skin
prick test, and the remaining 110 patients were considered to have CSU. These 110 patients were further subjected to ASST, serum

 

immunoglobulin E (IgE), and peripheral blood eosinophilia, ASST was positive in 48 patients and negative in 62 patients. Frequency
of urticarial attacks and associated diseases such as abnormal thyroid function tests in both ASST-positive and ASST-negative patients
did not show any statistical significance. Only attacks of angioedema in ASST-positive individuals were higher and were statistically
significant. In the ASST-positive group, 31 (81.25%) patients showed improvement with first-line antihistamines, along with oral
prednisolone and injection Histaglobulin and 10 (10.41%) patients did not show any improvement. Thirty-three (43.54%) patients
in the ASST-negative group showed improvement while 13 (30.62%) patients did not show improvement. Conclusion: ASST is
considered a screening test for AIU, which decreases the rate of diagnosis of “idiopathic” form of CU. ASST-positive patients in
addition to antihistamines, were treated with short course of oral steroids and weekly Histaglobulin injections for 5 weeks followed
by the 3" and 6" months.

Kumar, ef a/.: Autologous serum skin test in chronic spontaneous urticaria and its treatment outcome

 

Introduction

Urticaria is characterized by short-lived swellings
of the skin due to transient leakage of plasma into
the surrounding superficial dermis. Most types of
urticaria are due to activation of dermal mast cells.
Numerous chemotactic factors, enzymes, cytokines, and
proteoglycans exist preformed in cutaneous mast cell
granules or are newly generated from the membrane of
the mast cells and can be readily released.

Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) or chronic spontaneous
urticaria (CSU) is manifested as widespread, short-lived
(lasting less than 24 h) wheals occurring daily or almost
daily for at least 6 weeks and where a predominant
physical cause has been excluded."

Chronic urticaria (CU) affects 0.1% of the
population.”“) Recent reports have indicated the presence
of autoantibodies in about one-third of the patients with
CIU. These histamine-releasing autoantibodies are
directed against the alpha subunit of the high affinity
immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor FceR1 a. Patients
with autoantibodies in their sera have no distinctive
diagnostic clinical features and tend to have more severe
and unremitting urticaria and usually pose a therapeutic
challenge to the treating physician.>7 Although basophil
histamine release assay is currently the “gold standard”
for detecting functional autoantibodies in the serum of
patients, it is a time-consuming procedure and difficult
to standardize. Western blotting, enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and flow cytometry
using chimeric cell lines expressing the human Fc epsilon
receptor I alpha (FceRI «) may be useful in the future.

The autologous serum skin test (ASST), which indicates
the presence of functional circulating autoantibodies to
FceRI a and/or to IgE, is the best test in vivo clinical test
for the detection of basophil histamine-releasing activity
in vitro. ASST has a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of
80%. Disease activity of urticaria correlates directly with
the serum levels of FceRI o autoantibody.

As the conventional approach of management of CSU
may be unsuccessful, ASST is especially important from
the therapeutic point of view as it can help dermatologists
to commit themselves to initiate immunosuppressive
therapy in such patients.

Materials and Methods

This was a prospective correlation study conducted in
110 CSU patients from January 2012 to May 2013. Two
hundred patients of CU presenting with widespread,
short-lived (lasting less than 24 h) wheals occurring
daily or almost daily for at least 6 weeks were

screened, attending the Outpatient Department of
Dermatology, RRMCH were included in this study.
Approval of the Institutional Ethics Committee of
RRMCH was obtained for conducting this study and
written informed consent was taken from each patient.
Antihistamines were withdrawn 48 h before ASST
was performed. None of the patients were taking
corticosteroid or immunosuppressive drugs 4 weeks
before the study.

All patients were exposed to

¢ Thorough history taking including duration of
the disease, frequency of attacks associated with
angioedema, dermographism, or systemic symptoms
(fever, joint pain, and abdominal pain).

¢ General and dermatological clinical examinations.

¢ Routine investigations included urine and stool
analysis, complete blood count (CBC), liver function
test (LFT), renal function test (RFT), and thyroid
function test (TFT) (T3, T4, and TSH). Investigations
for thyroid antibodies, C3 and C4 complement levels,
and antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) were not done
due to logistical problems.

¢ Tests for hepatitis C virus and hepatitis B virus.
Patients with physical urticaria, food and drug
allergies, and urticarial vasculitis were ruled out after
taking detailed history and relevant investigations.
Also, all patients underwent skin prick test and
patients found positive for common allergens were
excluded.

The remaining patients with CSU were admitted in the
hospital and exposed to:

¢ Peripheral blood absolute eosinophil count.

¢ Serum IgE level.

¢ ASST technique by using insulin syringe.

Autologous serum skin test technique

Samples of 5 mL of venous blood was drawn into sterile
vacutainers without a clotting accelerator and allowed
to clot at room temperature for 30 min. The serum was
sent to a clinical laboratory for centrifugation at 2,000
rpm for 15 min. Samples of 0.05 mL of autologous serum
and 0.9% sterile normal saline were injected seperately
intradermally over the uninvolved volar aspect of the
orearm leaving a gap of at least 3 cm between the
two injection sites. After 30 min, the wheal formed at
each injection site was measured. A positive ASST was
defined as a serum induced wheal of 1.5 mm or more
han the saline induced response at 30 min. During
he initial screening of CU patients, skin prick test for
allergens was done in all patients to identify any cause
and to classify CSU. Clinically all these patients had
ong-standing classical history of urticarial wheals and
flare with few episodes of angioedema; hence, positive

control using injection histamine was not done while
performing ASST.

All the patients were grouped into ASST-positive and
ASST-negative after the initial tests and the results, along
with all other parameters, were compared. Both the
ASST-positive and ASST-negative groups were treated
with similar drugs in addition to antihistamines; they
received short course oral steroids, tablet prednisolone
20 mg once daily for 1 week, along with weekly
Histaglobulin injections subcutaneously for 5 weeks
and at the 3 month and 6th month and the outcome
was noted. The treatment response was assessed weekly
for the first 5 weeks and later during the 3‘¢ month and
6" month.

Statistical studies

Data entry and analyses were performed using statistical
package for social sciences (SPSS) version 10 (IBM
Corporation, USA). Descriptive statistical analysis has been
carried out in the present study. Results on continuous
measurements are presented on mean + standard deviation
(SD) (minimum-maximum), and results on categorical
measurements are presented in number (%). Significance
wasassessed at 5% (P value). P< 0.05 indicated a significant
result. Chi-square/ Fischer exact test has been used to find
the significance of study parameters on categorical scale
between two or more groups. Student's t-test (2-tailed,
independent) has been used to find the significance of

study parameters on a continuous scale between the two
groups, intergroup analysis.

Results

One hundred and ten patients with CSU were evaluated,
out of 200 patients with CU initially screened for this
study. The remaining 90 patients had an excludable
cause, after through history and skin prick test.
These 110 patients were subjected to ASST, absolute
eosinophil count (AEC), serum IgE, and peripheral blood
eosinophilia. Positive ASST was seen in 48 (43.62%)
patients and negative ASST was found in 62 (56.36%)
patients. Clinical data of patients with positive ASST
versus negative ASST are shown in [Table 1].

Out of 110 patients, 37 (33.63%) patients were males
and 73 (66.36%) patients were females. The male:female
ratio was 1:1.9. Negative ASST was found in 40 females
(67.74%) and 22 males (32.25%). Positive ASST was found
in 33 (64.58%) females and 15 (35.41%) males. However,
there was no significant difference between both the
genders (P = 0.641).

Out of 110 patients, the minimum age was 5 years and
maximum age was 60 years. The average age observed was
30.23 years. The mean age of patients with ASST-positive
patients was 28.54 + 13.50 years and the mean age of patients
with ASST-negative patients was 31.55 + 14.43 years but this
difference was not significant (P = 0.262) [Table 2].

The minimum duration of an illness was 2 months
while the maximum was 120 months. An average
duration of illness was 16.34 months. However, there
was no significant increase in duration of the disease
in the ASST-positive group in comparison to that of
the ASST-negative group (P = 0.498). The frequency of
urticarial attacks in both ASST-positive and ASST-negative
groups did not show any statistical significance. Thirteen
(33.33%) patients in the ASST-positive group and eight
(14.51%) patients in the ASST-negative group had
angioedema; this was statistically significant (P = 0.031).

Associated diseases of thyroid abnormality were noted
in eight (16.66%) of the ASST-positive patients and five
(8.06%) of the patients in the ASST negative group,
which was statistically not significant (P = 0.166).
Seven patients were hypothyroid with elevated TSH
levels and one was hyperthyroid in the ASST-positive
group. All five patients in the ASST-negative group
were hypothyroid. There was nonsignificant difference
between ASST-positive and ASST-negative groups
regarding routine investigations. (P = 0.7) [Table 3].

Patients with an autoimmune urticaria (AIU) have more
severe unremitting urticaria. ASST-positive patients
in addition to antihistamines were treated with short
course oral steroids, along with weekly Histaglobulin
injections subcutaneously for 5 weeks and at the 3"

not show improvement with first-line antihistamines
were also administered with oral steroids and injection

the disease activity.

In the ASST-positive group, 31 (81.25%) patients showed
improvement after treatment with injection Histaglobulin
in addition to antihistamines, 10 (10.41%) patients did
not show any improvement while seven (8.33%) patients
were lost to follow-up. Thirty-three (43.54%) patients in
the ASST-negative group showed improvement while
13 (30.62%) patients did not show improvement and
the remaining 16 (25.80%) were lost to follow-up. Out of
48 ASST-positive patients, 31 patients showed significant
improvement in disease activity upon addition of oral
steroids and injection Histaglobulin, along with first-line
antihistamines. Thirty-three ASST-negative patients out
of 62, who did not show improvement with first-line
antihistamines or who failed to achieve remission were
also given oral steroids tablet prednisolone 20 mg once
daily for 1 week and injection Histaglobulin and showed
amarked reduction in symptoms such as the appearance
of wheals, duration and frequency of occurrence of the
disease; they were assessed during the regular weekly
follow-up for the first 5 weeks and later at the 3 month
and 6" month. However, this was not statistically
significant between positive and negative ASST groups
regarding the treatment outcome (P = 0.328) [Table 4].

Discussion

The basophil histamine release assay is currently the
gold standard for detecting functional autoantibodies
in the serum of patients with CU. But the disadvantages
of this procedure are that it is difficult to standardize
as it requires fresh basophils from healthy donors, is
time-consuming, and it remains confined to research
centers. Western blot, ELISA, and flow cytometry may
be useful for screening in the future but these need to
be validated.

ASST is the simplest and the best in vivo clinical test for
the detection of basophil histamine-releasing activity.
ASST is simple, semi-invasive, inexpensive, and easy
to perform. Results can be obtained within 30 min. The
test could be useful in India as it is economical and costeffective in comparison to basophil histamine release
assay.” The finding of ASST positivity in 43.62% of
the patients in our study was comparable with 27-60%
positivity reported previously."?"")

Sabroe et al. found evidence of functional autoantibodies
in 31% of the 107 patients with CU.""] Zweiman et al.
reported basophil histamine-releasing activity in 30% of
70 CU sera" while Tong et al. found that 52% of 50 CU
sera released histamine from basophils.'!

A study conducted by Sabroe et al.) and Azim et al.)
concluded that patients with autoantibodies in their sera
have more severe attacks according to several parameters
including frequency, duration of individual episodes,
and more episodes of angioedema in ASST-positive
patients but this was statistically not significant. This
was in concordance with our study regarding frequency
and duration of individual episodes but there was more
occurrence of angioedema in ASST-positive patients in
our study, which was statistically significant.

Regarding the sex and age distribution between ASSTpositive group and ASST-negative group, there was no
significant difference in our study.

The association of CU with thyroid autoimmunity has
been studied by Leznoff et al." and it was postulated
that thyroid autoimmunity may play a role in the
pathogenesis of CU and angioedema. A study conducted
by Noemi Bakos et al. observed a relationship between
AIU and autoimmune thyroiditis. In a study conducted
by Krupashankar et al.""*| a significantly higher incidence
of H. pylori antibodies and thyroid antibodies were
detected in ASST-positive patients in comparison to
ASST-negative patients. Autoimmune diseases such as
thyroid disease, vitiligo, diabetes mellitus, pernicious
anemia, and rheumatoid arthritis were reported more
commonly in patients with AIU."*! However, in our

study there was no significant difference in thyroid levels
in both the groups.

In our study group, patients who were both ASSTpositive and ASST-negative having severe unremitting
urticarial attacks not subsiding to antihistamines
received immunotherapy in the form of short course of
oral corticosteroids for 1 week, along with subcutaneous
injection Histaglobulin weekly for 5 weeks followed by
the 3rd month and 6th month, and showed improvement
in the form of decreased severity of symptoms,
appearance of wheals, and duration and frequency of
occurrence of the disease assessed during the follow-up
for receiving the treatment.

Histaglobulin, a product of the serum institute of India
contains histamine with human immunoglobulin.
When administered subcutaneously, it forms antibodies
against histamine, which increases the histamine-binding
capacity of the serum. It is indicated for the treatment of
atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and chronic allergic
states." This form of immunotherapy could prove
to be useful in India as it is economical, cost-effective,
and can be an alternative to the use of expensive drugs
such as cyclosporine and omalizumab in the treatment
of CU. Further large scale studies can substantiate the
use of immunotherapy in AIU, which are resistant to
conventional anti-histamine therapy.

Conclusion

ASST is considered a screening test for AIU, which
decreases the rate of diagnosis of “idiopathic” form of CU.
Our study showed that there is no difference statistically
between ASST-positive and ASST-negative patients in
terms of epidemiologic details except for the frequency
of attacks of angioedema. In our study, the follow-up
period of patients was only 6 months but there is a need
for more studies and a longer follow-up period after
treatment to conclude the significance of ASST and its
treatment outcome with Histaglobulin immunotherapy.
