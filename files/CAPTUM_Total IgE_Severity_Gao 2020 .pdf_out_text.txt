Abstract: Accumulating evidence demonstrated that circulating CD4*CXCR5", follicular helper T (Tfh) and follicular
regulatory T (Tfr) cells maintain immune homeostasis and humoral immune response and were involved in the
pathogenesis of certain autoimmune/inflammatory diseases. The current study was aimed to investigate the correlation between frequencies of CD4*CXCRS5*, Tfh and Tfr cells, Tfh/Tfr and the disease activity in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). Frequencies of CD4*CXCR5*, Tfh and Tfh/Tfr, but not Tfr, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) were elevated in patients with CSU as compared with healthy controls. No difference was observed in the
frequency of these cells between different subgroups of patients based on autologous serum skin testing (ASST),
skin prick testing (SPT) and the level of total IgE. The expression of CXCR5 in PBMCs was higher in CSU than in
controls, both at mRNA and protein levels. Higher levels of plasma IL-4, IL-6 and total IgE were observed in CSU, with
positive correlation between IL-4/IL-6 and total IgE. The IL-21 level was lower and negatively correlated with total
IgE. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, we found positive correlation between the urticaria activity
score (UAS) and CD4*CXCR5", Tfh, Tfh/Tfr and total IgE, respectively, with area under the curves (AUCs) all greater
than 0.7 (P < 0.05). These results indicated that frequencies of circulating CD4*CXCR5* cells, Tfh cells and Tfh/Tfr
were abnormal and correlated positively with disease severity, suggesting the possible involvement of these cells in

the immunopathogenesis of CSU.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common recurrent skin disease, with a great impact on the life quality and health [1]. According to autologous serum skin test (ASST) and
skin prick test (SPT), CSU can be divided into
several subtypes [2-4]. A variety of factors,
including autoreactivity, infections, genetic factors, coagulation cascade and autoimmunity,
can contribute to the pathogenesis of CSU [1],
but the complexity of the disease remains elusive. Recent studies suggested the association
with IgE to autoallergens and IgG autoantibodies to IgE or its receptor [5].

Follicular helper T (Tfh) cell is a subgroup of
CD4*CXCR5* (C-X-C chemokine receptor 5)
cells that activates germinal center formation

and provides help for B cells in producing autoantibodies and their differentiation into memory cells and long-lived plasma cells [6, 7].
Follicular regulatory T (Tfr) cells are differentiated from T regulatory (Treg) cells that inhibit
germinal center formation and B cell development [7]. Both Tfh and Tfr cells express CXCR5,
but differ in that Tfr cells expresse CD25 and
FoxP3 [8]. Increase or decrease of circulating
CD4*CXCRS5*, Tfh or Tfr cells was found to be
associated with immune imbalance, contributing to the pathogenesis of certain diseases,
such as atopic dermatitis [9], allergic asthma
[10], psoriasis [11], bullous pemphigoid [12],
systemic lupus erythematosus [13-15], primary
sjogren’s syndrome [16], primary biliary cholangitis [17] and rthumatoid arthritis [18]. In addition, the complex cytokine signals network is
essential for differentiation of Tfh cells and

production of autoantibodies in B cells. Tfh
cells produce cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-6 and
IL-21, which help the class switching of B cells.
For example, IL-6 could regulate the number of
Tfh cells and the production of total IgE in sensitized mice [19], while IL-4 produced from Tfh
cells could regulate the production of IgG1 and
IgE in allergic immune mice [20]. Since IgE and
IgE autoantibodies have been shown their roles
in pathognesis of CSU, it is important to explore
the changes of CD4*CXCR5* subpopulations
which maybe helpful to understand the class
switching of B cells in CSU.

The current study was aimed to detect frequencies of CD4*CXCR5*, Tfh and Tfr cells and the
Tfh/Tfr ratio in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs) of patients with CSU as compared to normal healthy controls (HC), regarding their correlations to the disease activity.
The expression levels of CXCR5 in PBMCs and
the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines
(IL-4, IL-6 and IL-21) and total IgE in the plasma
of studied samples were also evaluated.

 

Material and methods
Participants and blood sampling

A total of 24 healthy controls (HC) and 63
patients diagnosed with CSU, matched in sex
and age distribution, were recruited in the current study. The study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of Southwest Hospital, Army
Medical University, Chongqing, with informed
consent from all the participants. Diagnosis of
CSU was made and the disease severity (urticaria activity score, UAS) was measured at the
time of blood sampling according to the EAACI/
GA?LEN/EDF/WAO guideline [1]. PBMCs were
prepared by density gradient centrifugation
from peripheral blood and anticoagulated with
EDTA-K2. Plasma samples were separated and
stored at -80°C until used for ELISA. ASST and
SPT were performed in patients with CSU as
previously described [2, 3]. The allergens of
SPT included dust mites, house dust mites,
cockroaches, mugwort pollen, fish (squid),
shrimp, duck feather, silk, crab, egg, cow milk
and peanut. Patients with CSU and SPT+ displaying one or more positive allergens were
indicated as allergic sensitization.

Flow cytometry

For detection of Tfh and Tfr cells, human PBMCs were stained with FITC mouse anti-hu
4435

man CD4 (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA,
USA), CD185 (CXCR5)-APC human (Miltenyi
Biotec, CA, USA), PE-CY™7 mouse anti-human
CD25 (BD Biosciences), and PE mouse antihuman CD127 (BD Biosciences). Cells were
collected with FACSCanto™ || Flow Cytometer
(BD Biosciences). Total CD4*CXCR5* cells were
gated by the forward/side scatter showing
CD4/CXCR5 expression patterns. Circulating
Tfh (CD4*CXCR5*CD25'"CD127"=) and Tfr
(CD4*CXCR5*CD25"8"CD127'™) cells were gated based on expression levels of CD25 and
CD127. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Stanford University, San Francisco, CA,
USA).

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)

PBMCs were resuspended in RNAiso Plus
(TaKaRa, Dalian, China) and total RNA was
extracted according to instructions of manufacturer. For CXCR5 detection, cDNAs were
synthesized using PrimeScript™ RT reagent Kit
(TaKaRa). qRT-PCR was performed with TB
Gerrn™ Premix Ex Taq™ Il (TaKaRa) on a CFX
Connect™ Real-Time System (BIO-RAD, Singapore, USA). The reaction parameters were as
follows: 95°C for 30 s, then 40 cycles of 95°C
for 5s and 60°C for 45 s. The expression levels were calibrated to the B-actin control and
determined by the 2“4*t method. The primers
used were as follows: CXCR5 forward, 5’-CAACAACTCCCTGCCACGTT-3’ and reverse, 5’-AGGAATCCCGCCACATGGTA-3’; B-actin forward, 5’CTCTTCCAGCCTTCCTTCCT-3' and reverse, 5’AGCACTGTGTTGGCGTACAG-3’ (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China).

Western blotting

PBMCs were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with phenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride
protease inhibitor (Beyotime, Shanghai, China).
Proteins were separated by electrophoresis in
4-20% SurePAGE™ gel (GenScript, Nanjing,
China) and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).
The membranes were incubated with primary
antibodys against CXCR5 (Abcam, Cambridge,
MA) or GAPDH (Bioss, Beijing, China), and then
washed and incubated with the secondary antibody (Abclonal, Wuhan, China). Proteins were
detected by scanning the membranes with
ChemiDoc™ Touch Imaging System (BIO-RAD),
and band intensities were quantified using CFX
Manager (BIO-RAD).

cells (Figure 1B).

Upregulation of CXCR5 expression in
CSU

A significant upregulation of CXCR5
at the mRNA level (Figure 2A) as well
as in the protein expression (Figure
2B and 2C) was observed in patients
with CSU, as compared with HC.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)

Plasma levels of IL-4 (BD Biosciences), IL-6
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA), IL-21 (Biolegend, USA) and total IgE (EUROIMMUN, Beijing, China) were measured using ELISAs according to instructions of the manufacturers.

Statistical analysis

Results were expressed as mean + standard
error of the mean (SEM). Two-tailed Student’s
t-test was used to compare the two groups.
Correlation analyses were conducted using
Spearman's rank test. Data were recorded and
analyzed with SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism version
5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA),
and P < 0.05 was considered as statistically
significant.

Results

A total of 63 patients with CSU were recruited. Among them, there were 15 ASST+ vs. 48
ASST-, 42 SPT+ vs. 21 SPT-. The control group
included 23 HC. Their demographic and clinical characteristics were listed in Table 1. Significant differences were not observed in gender and age between CSU patients and HC.

Correlation between the plasma levels of IL-4, IL-6, 1-21 and the total IgE
in CSU

Significantly higher plasma levels of IL-4 and
IL-6 but lower IL-21 were found in patients with
CSU than in HC (Figure 3A). The levels of total
IgE were significantly higher in patients with
CSU (Figure 3A), and positively correlated with
IL-4 and IL-6, but negatively with IL-21 (Figure
3B).

No significant difference of circulating
CD4*CXCR5* cells, Tfh cells, Tfr cells or the
Tfh/Tfr ratio among the different subgroups

We divided CSU patients into different subgroups based on ASST, SPT or the levels of total
IgE as before [2] to see possible differences.
There are no significant differences in the frequencies of circulating CD4*CXCR5* cells, Tfh
cells, Tfr cells and the Tfh/Tfr in different subgroups (Figure 4). After further division of the
patients into four groups, ASST+/SPT+, ASST+/
SPT-, ASST-/SPT+ and ASST-/SPT-, we still failed to identify any difference among them (data
not shown).

 

There was no significant difference in patients
with CSU between different subgroups, regarding gender, age and the UAS (Table 2).

CD4*CXCR5* cells, Tfh cells, the Tfh/Tfr ratio

There was a positive correlation between
CD4*CXCR5* cells, Tfh cells, the Tfh/Tfr ratio,
total IgE and the urticaria activity (UAS), respectively. While no such correlation was observed for Tfr cells (Figure 5A). The ROC curve

Discussion

The pathogenic roles of CD4*CXCR5*, Tfh and
Tfr cells in autoimmune and autoinflammatory

4438

diseases have received much attention in recent years. In children with atopic dermatitis,
the percentages and absolute numbers of circulating Tfh-like cells (CD4*CXCR5*ICOS*PD-1")
were increased and their production of IL-21
cytokine positivily correlated with the disease
severity index SCORAD [9]. In patients with sysemic lupus erythematosus, the frequencies of
Tfh and Tfr cells as well as the Tfh/Tfr ratio in
peripheral blood were abnormal (increased or
decresed) and correlated with the disease acivity [13-15]. In bullous pemphigoid, the frequency of Tfh cells in peripheral blood of paients was increased and correlated with the
production of anti-BP180-NC16A autoantibodies [12]. All these studies suggested the poential involvement of these cells in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity and disease.

There are at least two distinct pathways, type |
(IgE to autoallergens) and type II (IgG autoantibodies to IgE or its receptor) autoimmunity,
have been proposed to contribute to the pathologic mechanisms of CSU [5]. Antibodies, which
are produced by the associated B cells and
helper T cells, may play an important role in the
pathogenesis of urticaria [4, 21]. Human studies have demonstrated a central role of CXCR5
in the migration of T and B cells into follicles,
ormation of germinal center, production of pahogenic autoantibodies, and governing the
ability of Tfh cells to help B cells [22-24]. Our
study provided the primary evidence of an upregulation of CXCR5 in PBMCs and the increased CD4*CXCR5* T cells, Tfh cells and the Tfh/
Tfr ratio in patients with CSU.

 

 

 

Studies reported that the production of IgE
was mainly derived from two pathways, extraollicular and germinal centers [25]. Early IgE
antibody response arises from extrafollicular, whereas late IgE antibody response arises
rom germinal centers. IgE germinal center B
cells mainly differentiate into short-lived IgE
plasma cells, which produce IgE of high-mutaion and mature affinity to bind antigens with
higher affinity in the environment [25]. Most
IgE cells are plasma cells and high affinity IgE
is produced by the switching of IgG1 cells to
IgE [26]. CD4*CXCR5* cells and Tfh cells were
ound to regulate B cells to produce specific IgE
and total IgE. In patients with asthma, the frequency of CD4*CXCR5* cells in peripheral blood
was increased and associated with the producion of pathogenic total IgE antibody [10]. Tfh
cells could regulate B cells to produce anti-OVA

IgE and total IgE in allergic immune response to
airborne allergens [27]. Our results that total
IgE in plasma of patients with CSU was elevated and associated with UAS confirmed earlier
reports [28, 29]. Taken together, the formation
of germinal centers and the increased frequencies of CD4*CXCR5* cells and Tfh cells in peripheral blood may be involved in the production
of total IgE and contributing to the pathogenesis in CSU patients.

Multiple factors, including cytokines, such as
IL-4, IL-6, TGF-B, IL12 and IL-21, are involved
in the differentiation and function of Tfh cells
[30]. In OVA plus alum-sensitized mice, antiOVA and total IgE antibodies were induced and
promoted by IL-4-secreting Tfh cells [20]. The
specific block of IL-6R signaling on T cells can
suppress the number of Tfh cells and the increase in the concentration of total IgE, Derp
1-specific IgE or IgG1 in B cells after sensitizaion in CD4°°xgp1307% mice [19]. The IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway has been shown to regulate the frequency of Tfh cells in the peripheral blood of patients with rheumatoid arthritis
18]. I-21, a cytokine produced by Tfh cells, is
essential for the immunomodulation of humoral and cellular immune responses. The role of
L-21 in the production of IgE remains controversial, regarding its promotion or inhibition of
specific immune functions [31-34]. Our results
indicated that the total IgE was related to IL-4,
L6, and IL-21, which suggested that Tfh cells
might promote the production of total IgE through IL-4 and IL-6, and induced the class
switching of B cells in CSU patients, while IL21 inhibited the production of IgE from B cells,
as demonstrated in previous studies [4, 21,
35-38].

 

 

 

In the current study, the positive correlation
between CD4*CXCR5* cells, Tfh cells, Tfh/Tfr
ratio and the UAS, and the higher AUCs of
CD4*CXCR5* and Tfh cells frequencies and
Tfh/Tfr ratio indicated their potential use as
serological markers in clinical diagnosis and
follow-up of therapeutic response in patients
with CSU.

 

There are some limitations in the current study.
The lack of dynamic observations, such as the
changes of the above parameters during the
active versus and remission period of CSU,
make it impossible to verify the time-course
change of the immunological parameters. The

 

4442

relationship between the changes of the above
parameters and the therapeutic efficacy is not
clear. It remains to be confirmed whether increase of IL-4 and IL-6 and decrease of IL-21
can induce CD4*CXCR5* cells and Tfh cells to
help B cells to produce IgE in patients with CSU.

In conclusion, the positive correlation between
CD4*CXCR5* cells, Tfh cells and the UAS, and
the higher AUCs of CD4*CXCR5* and Tfh cells
frequencies in CSU indicated their potential
use as serological markers in clinical diagnosis and follow-up of therapeutic response in
patients with CSU. Our results provided the
primary evidence that the regulation of class
switching of B cells may be associated with
immunopathogenesis and disease severity of
CSU.
