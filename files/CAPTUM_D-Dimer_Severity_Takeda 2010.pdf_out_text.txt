Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CU) is a common skin disorder characterized by spontaneously appearing wheals and
pruritus anywhere on the body for 6 weeks or longer (1). It
severely impairs the quality of life of patients (2). In patients
with urticaria, degranulation of cutaneous mast cells by a
variety of reasons results in the release of histamine, which
induces the activation of sensory nerves, vasodilatation, and
extravasation of plasma from microvessels into the dermis.
The administration of anti-histamines effectively suppresses
symptoms of many patients with CU. Although IgG antibody to IgE and/or those to the high affinity IgE receptor
plays a role in the mechanism for activation of cutaneous
mast cells and blood basophils in CU (3, 4), the detailed
mechanism of mast cell stimulation in CU remains to be fully
elucidated and a substantial population of patients with CU
is not sufficiently controlled with anti-histamines alone. On
the other hand, beneficial effects of anticoagulants such as

Abstract

Background: The pathogenesis of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CU) has recently
been conceived to be associated with thrombin generation through the extrinsic
coagulation pathway. However, little is known about the components of the intrinsic coagulation pathway potentially involved.

Methods: To investigate the whole process of coagulation, both classical coagulation
assays and a global coagulation test, the intrinsic coagulation pathway-dependent
activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) clot waveform analysis, were performed using plasma of 36 patients with CU who had various severities.

Results: Classical coagulation assays revealed that levels of fibrinogen, D-dimer, and
fibrin and fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), and positive rates of soluble
fibrin monomer complex (SFMC) were significantly elevated in patients with CU,
whereas the elevation of prothrombin fragment | + 2 was not statistically significant. On the other hand, all parameters of a global coagulation test, APTT clot
waveform analysis, evidently showed a hypercoagulable pattern and were significantly correlated to disease severity of CU.

Conclusions: CU is characterized by elevated blood coagulation potential with
involvement of the intrinsic coagulation factors, which may contribute in vivo to the
generation of fibrin even by small amounts of thrombin.

heparin and warfarin have been reported in some patients
with intractable urticaria (5-7), but the pharmacological
mechanisms by which anticoagulants exert their effects in
urticaria has long been unexplained.

In recent years, a series of reports by Asero and his colleagues has shed light on the involvement of coagulation in
the pathogenesis of CU. They described enhanced thrombin
generation through the observation of high levels of prothrombin fragments | + 2 (PF1 + 2) in patients with CU
(8). They argued that thrombin generation is accelerated by
the increase of tissue factor (TF) expressed in dermal tissues
via the activation of extrinsic coagulation (9). They advocated that the accelerated generation of thrombin would then
activate mast cells and increase endothelial permeability (8).
However, Kaplan and Greaves recently challenged this
scenario on several points: (i) lack of evidence for thrombindependent activation of human mast cells, (ii) immediate

inactivation of thrombin by plasma inhibitors, (iii) possible
presence of yet to be defined plasma factor other than thrombin that leads to an increase in endothelial permeability (10).
In this context, the extrinsic coagulation pathway evoked by
activated factor VII (FVIla)-TF binding is known to be
promptly attenuated due to a large amount of tissue factor
pathway inhibitor (TFPI) in tissues (11). Therefore, the coactivation of the intrinsic pathway coagulation factors, especially factors VIII and IX, should be requisite to overcome
the inhibition by TFPI and complete coagulation by full
thrombin generation (i.e. thrombin burst).

To elucidate a more detailed condition of coagulation in
CU, including the involvement of the intrinsic coagulation
pathway, it is fundamental to assess the whole process of
coagulation. However, conventional assays for blood coagulation measure only a part of the coagulation process, such
as the initiation time of clot formation, and do not necessarily reflect the overall coagulation process. Both prothrombin
time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)
are useful to obtain information for only an early stage of
clot formation. On the other hand, classical thrombin assays,
such as prothrombin fragment | + 2 (PF1 + 2), estimate
the amount of thrombin that has already been generated
before blood collection. However, recently developed clot
waveform analysis assesses the whole process of coagulation
beyond the initiation time of clot formation through continuously charting the changes in light transmittance on standard
coagulation assays such as APTT (12, 13). Data are mathematically processed to derive several unique parameters, such
as to reflect hemorrhagic and thrombophilic conditions perceptively. In this study, we evaluated hemostatic profiles of
plasma in patients with CU using APTT clot waveform analysis as well as classical coagulation assays in order to elucidate the precise involvement of coagulation in CU.

Methods
Patients and plasma samples

We recruited 15 normal healthy individuals and 36 patients
with CU of various severities. Mean + SD age of healthy
individuals was 37.4 + 14.0 years (range 27-80) and that of
CU patients was 47.0 + 18.0 years (range 9-76). No significant age differences were seen between these groups. All
patients were diagnosed at Department of Dermatology,
Hiroshima University Hospital on the basis of the appearance of spontaneous wheals anywhere on the body with or
without angioedema for more than 6 weeks (1). All patients
with CU whose severity was properly assessed and described
in the medical record at the time of blood collection were
divided into three groups using a clinical urticaria-severity
score (1-3: mild, moderate, and severe, respectively) as
described elsewhere (14, 15). According to this score, 10
patients were evaluated as mild, 19 as moderate, and 7 as
severe.

Blood was drawn into evacuated anticoagulant tubes [nine
volumes of blood to one volume of 3.8% (w/v) trisodium
citrate solution]. After centrifugation for 15 min at 1500 g,

the platelet-poor plasma was stored at ~80°C and thawed at
37°C immediately prior to performing the assays described.

The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of
the Declaration of Helsinki, was approved by the Nara Medical University Hospital Ethical Committee and the Institutional Review Board at the Hiroshima University Hospital,
and all subjects gave their informed consent before participation.

Classical coagulation assays

Among coagulation factors, fibrinogen and factors VII, VIII,
and X clotting activities (FVII:C, FVII:C, and FX:C) were
measured by a one-step clotting assay on a MDA-II Haemostasis System (bioMérieux, Lyon, France) using the respective
factor-deficient plasma (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan), Thrombocheck Fib-L (Sysmex), Thrombocheck PT Plus (Sysmex), and
Thrombocheck APTT-SLA (Sysmex). A standard curve was
prepared using Verify Reference Plasma (bioMérieux) in
serial doubling dilutions (1:10-1:1280) in 0.05 M imidazole
saline buffer containing 0.05% sodium azide (pH 7.3). The
Verify Reference Plasma is calibrated by the manufacturer
against an International FVIII Standard (IRP-SSC1 or 2).
Each test sample was diluted to 1:10 in imidazole saline
buffer. Plasma von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag) level
was determined by ELISA using double-antibody sandwich
techniques (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark).

Plasma FDP and D-dimer were measured by the latex
agglutination method using Nanopia P-FDP (Daiichi Pure
Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan), COBAS INTEGRA 700 (Roche
Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan), respectively. The plasma
PFI + 2 levels were measured using an enzyme immunoassay (Enzygnost PFl + 2 micro, Dade Behring, Germany)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plasma soluble
fibrin monomer complex (SFMC) was determined by the
fibrin monomer-coated erythrocyte aggregation method using
the FM test (Roche Diagnostics), which gave qualitative
results.

APTT clot waveform analysis

APTT clot waveform analysis of the optical data obtained
from the modified APTT assay was performed on the MDAII Haemostasis System as described previously (16). As with
an APTT assay, the analysis is performed by adding to
plasma a surface activator, phospholipids, and calcium ions
to activate the intrinsic clotting system. Intrinsic coagulation
potential of plasma is reflected in clot waveform. The
obtained data were processed subsequently by export
research tools (WIT/WET, bioMérieux, Fig. 1). The first
derivative of the transmittance (d7/d/) reflects the coagulation velocity at each time point along the waveform plot of
changes in light transmission, which in turn reflects the conversion of fibrinogen to a fibrin clot. Point ‘a’ marks the
beginning of the recording by the instrument which occurs
8 s after the addition of CaCl. The minimum value of the
first derivative (Minl), defining the maximum velocity of
change in light transmission achieved (point ‘c’), was calcu

The second derivative of the transmittance data (d°T/d’’)
reflects the acceleration of the reaction at any given time
point. The minimum value of the second derivative (Min2),
measured at point ‘b’, and the maximal value of the second
derivative (Max2) at point ‘d’ were also calculated as an
index of the maximum acceleration of the reaction achieved
(16). Reduction in Clot Time and increase in |Min1|, Max2,
and |Min2| shows a hypercoagulable state, whereas prolonged Clot Time and decreased |Minl|, Max2, and |Min2
indicate a hypocoagulable state or bleeding tendency.

Statistical analysis

Data are presented as mean + SD. Statistical analysis of
differences among two groups was determined by the Mann—
Whitney test. The chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test was
used to determine differences with respect to SFMC test. Correlations were calculated according to Spearman rank correlation coefficient. The level of significance was set at P < 0.05.
All analyses were done using the GRAPHPAD PRISM (GraphPad
Software, San Diego, CA, USA) and ystaT 2002 software
package (Igaku Tosho Shuppan, Tokyo, Japan).

Results
Hemostatic profiles in the CU patients

The results of classical coagulation assays; coagulation factors and coagulation activation markers, are shown in Fig. 2.
Among coagulation factors, a significantly elevated level was
observed in fibrinogen in the CU patient group (P < 0.05)
(Fig. 2A). Among markers of activated coagulations, the
levels of D-dimer and FDP and the positive rate of SFMC
were higher in the CU patient group than in the control

group (P < 0.05). The levels of PF1 + 2 levels in the CU
group were also higher than those in control groups, but the
difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 2B). On the
other hand, all parameters in clot waveform analysis showed
the hypercoagulable pattern in the CU patient group: significantly reduced Clot Time and elevated |Min1l|, Max2, and
\Min2|: P < 0.05, P < 0.01, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively (Fig. 2C).

When patients were divided according to clinical severities
of CU, they were significantly correlated to levels of D-dimer
(P < 0.05) and PF1 + 2 (P < 0.01), and positive rates of
SFMC (P < 0.05), but not to levels of FDP and coagulation
factors (Fig. 3A and B). On the other hand, significant correlations were observed between disease severities and all
parameters in clot waveform analysis, Clot Time, |Min1|,
Max2, and |Min2) (P < 0.01) (Fig. 3C).

Discussion

In this study, we have demonstrated that increased coagulation potential is strongly associated with symptoms of CU by
performing APTT clot waveform analysis in addition to
assays for the levels of coagulation factors and markers of
activated coagulations.

We first evaluated hemostatic profiles using classical coagulation assays. Among coagulation factors in patients with
CU, the level of fibrinogen was higher than that of healthy
controls (Fig. 2A). However, no correlation was observed
between the levels of any coagulation factors and disease
severities of CU (Fig. 3A). Coagulation activation markers in
CU, D-dimer, FDP, PF1 + 2, and positive rate of SFMC
tend to be elevated and correlated with disease severities in
patients with CU. However, the increase of PFI + 2 in
patients with CU was not significant as compared with
healthy controls, and levels of FDP were not significantly
correlated with disease severities of CU (Figs 2B and 3B).

On the other hand, all parameters in APTT clot waveform
analysis showed significantly hypercoagulable patterns in
patients with CU (Fig. 2C), and significantly correlated to
disease severities of CU (Fig. 3C). It is known that the level
of PF1 + 2, the level of D-dimer, and the positive rate of
SFMC refiect the amount of thrombin actually generated,
and the level of FDP reflects both the amount of actually
generated thrombin and fibrinolytic activity. However, we do
not have clear data to explain the discrepancy between the
levels of actually activated coagulation markers and those of
coagulability represented by global coagulation test parameters. Taking into account that any clinically thrombotic
complications are not usually observed in association with
CU, there may be an urticaria intrinsic mechanism that
prevents the burst of thrombin formation, while it drives
coagulation to produce a small amount of thrombin.

Asero et al. (9) concluded that no activation of FXII was
evident in CU. We also found that FXII activity measured by
a one-step clotting assay was not elevated in CU patients
recruited in this study (data not shown). These observations
appear to suggest that the intrinsic coagulation pathway is
not involved in CU, since FXII is essential as an initiator of

the intrinsic pathway in the model of classical coagulation
cascade (contact system model). However, according to the
recently proposed ‘cell based model’ of thrombin generation
(17), the intrinsic pathway can be directly activated by a small
amount of thrombin via factor XI (FXI) on an activated
platelet membrane without the activation of FXII in vivo (18,
19). Moreover, thrombin generated by the extrinsic coagulation pathway should be promptly inactivated by TFPI without the activation of the intrinsic pathway. Furthermore,
APTT clot waveform analysis applied in this study is sensitive
to intrinsic factors VIII and IX, which are essential to overcome TFPI-mediated inhibition of the extrinsic pathway (19).
Although we did not measure individual activities of all intrinsic factors, the hypercoagulable pattern in APTT clot waveform analysis suggests a high potential of the intrinsic
coagulation cascade. Thus, it is feasible that the state of
hypercoagulability based on both intrinsic and extrinsic activation may play an important role in the pathogenesis of CU.
The relation of mast cell activation and the state of hypercoagulability is a matter of discussion. Asero etal. (8)
argued that thrombin activates skin mast cells via the activation of protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 based on their

observations of positive autologous plasma skin test in
patients with CU. However, there has not been enough evidence to confirm thrombin-dependent activation of mast cells
(10). In addition, thrombin formation is reduced by subcutaneously-injected histamine, which is released from activated
mast cells in vivo (20). Moreover, heparin proteoglycans
released from mast cells strongly inhibit interaction of platelets with collagen (21), an important physiological agonist
for platelets. Therefore, mast cell activation should result in
the inhibition of full platelet activation that is requisite for
thrombin burst. In fact, the amount of thrombin generation
observed in patients with CU in this study was small.

In the hypercoagulable state, the activation of mast cells
might be triggered or augmented by coagulation factors other
than thrombin through the activation of PAR-2 rather than
PAR-1. Recently, Wang et al. has mentioned that FVIIa may
cause mast cell degranulation via PAR-2 activation in
patients with CU (22). PAR-2 is cleaved by proteases with
trypsin-like specificity but not by thrombin that cleaves
PAR-1 and PAR-4. Moreover, as PAR-2 can be activated by
tryptase (23), once mast cells are activated, mast cells may be
further activated by tryptase secreted by activated mast cells.

It is noteworthy that the complex of FVIIa, activated FX
(FXa), and TF may work more efficiently as a PAR-2 agonist than FVIIa only (24-26). Since extrinsic TF-FVIla complex is promptly attenuated by TFPI, FXa generated with
help of intrinsic coagulation factors VIH and IX should be
crucial for PAR-2 activation. Thus, a hypercoagulable state
with low level of thrombin generation observed in CU may
potently evoke or augment mast cell activation through
PAR-2 cleavage by activated coagulation factors, and
prevents a progress of excessive thrombin generation. The
efficacy of several anti-coagulants, including nafamostat mesilate (27), heparin (6, 7) and warfarin (28, 29), reported in a
few cases of CU support this possibility. We are currently
studying if FVIIa actually induces histamine release from
human skin mast cells in vitro. Further studies about longer
and detailed time courses of hemostatic activities in patients
with CU, in relation to wheal formation, disease activities,
and mast cell activation should reveal their precise roles in
the pathogenesis of urticaria.
