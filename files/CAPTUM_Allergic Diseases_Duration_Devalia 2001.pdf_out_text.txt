A randomized, double-blind, crossover comparison among
cetirizine, levocetirizine, and ucb 28557 on histamine-induced
cutaneous responses in healthy adult volunteers

Background: Cetirizine is a highly efficacious and long-acting second-generation
H,-receptor antagonist for the treatment of allergic diseases, such as allergic
rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, in adults and children. Pharmacologic
studies have demonstrated that cetirizine, a racemate mixture composed of equal
amounts of two enantiomers, does not undergo hepatic metabolism to any
significant level. The enantiomers are excreted mainly unchanged, predominantly
in the urine and to a lesser extent in the faeces.

Methods: The pharmacologic activity and potency of the two enantiomers of
cetirizine in the management of allergic skin conditions were investigated by
studying the effect of treatment with 5.0 mg cetirizine; 2.5 mg levocetirizine, the
(R)-enantiomer; and 2.5 mg ucb 28557, the (S)-enantiomer, on histamineinduced wheal and flare response in 18 healthy volunteers. Each treatment was
administered as a single oral dose in randomized, double-blind, and crossover
manner, and the efficacy of treatment was assessed over a period of 32 h, as per
cent inhibition of the histamine-induced wheal and flare areas before treatment.
Blood and urine samples were collected in a time-dependent manner and
analyzed for the total amounts of each study drug, to elucidate their
pharmacokinetic profiles.
Results: Both cetirizine and levocetirizine caused a marked inhibition of
histamine-induced wheal and flare, whereas ucb 28557 was inactive in this model.
Inhibition of the wheal response observed for cetirizine and levocetirizine was
apparent by | h after dosage and lasted for mean durations of 24.4 and 28.4 h,
respectively. In addition, the response for cetirizine and levocetirizine became
maximal by 6 h after treatment, rising to 79.5% and 83.8%. Similarly, cetirizine
and levocetirizine also markedly inhibited the histamine-induced flare response.
This effect was evident for both drugs by | h after dosage and lasted over a mean
period of 28.4 and 26.0 h, respectively, for cetirizine and levocetirizine. The
inhibitory effect of these compounds on histamine-induced flare response was
also maximal by approximately 6 h after dosage, peaking at 88.5% and 83.6%,
respectively. Statistical evaluation showed that cetirizine and levocetirizine were
equivalent for maximum inhibition of histamine-induced wheal and flare.
However, levocetirizine was found to be superior to cetirizine when area under
the curve was compared. In contrast, ucb 28557 was not found to inhibit
histamine-induced wheal and flare responses at any time during the study period.
Plasma concentrations of levocetirizine were found to be approximately double
those of ucb 28557 at 4 and 8 h after dosing, and 50-60% of the drugs were
excreted unchanged in urine over a period of 32 h.

Conclusions: The finding that, in this model, levocetirizine 2.5 mg has
comparable antihistaminic activity to cetirizine 5 mg, whereas its other
enantiomer ucb 28557 has no pharmacodynamic effect, suggests that the
antihistaminic properties of cetirizine observed in the management of allergic
skin conditions are likely to be attributable to levocetirizine.

Several studies have suggested that histamine plays a
central role in the pathologic effects of urticaria (1,
2). Comparative studies of patients with chronic

50

urticaria and healthy subjects have demonstrated that
the urticaria patients release greater amounts of
histamine than the healthy subjects, both spontaneously and after antigen provocation (3-5).
Similarly, some studies have demonstrated that the
responsiveness of the skin to histamine is slightly
increased in patients with urticaria (3).

In the skin, histamine is stored primarily in the
mast cells and on release leads to parasympathetic
nerve stimulation and increased vascular permeability
(6, 7), resulting in the formation of itchy, slowly
expanding, erythematous wheals (3). Mechanistic
studies have demonstrated that the effects of histamine arise from its interaction with one or more of
three histamine receptors, H,, Hz, and H; (8-10), of
which activation of the H, receptors is thought to be
the most important in urticaria, in view of the
prominent and highly efficacious use of H, receptor
antagonists in the treatment of this condition (11-13).

Studies of cetirizine have demonstrated that this
compound has a greater selectivity for the H,receptors and low hepatic metabolism, in contrast
to many other second-generation antihistamines (14,
15). Several double-blind, crossover, or parallel-group
studies have demonstrated that cetirizine is significantly superior to placebo and some of the other H,receptor antagonists in providing general symptomatic relief from pruritis, wheals, and flares in
chronic idiopathic urticaria and some physical
urticarias (14). Similarly, several double-blind, crossover studies in healthy volunteers have also demonstrated that cetirizine is more effective than either
placebo or most of the other H,-receptor antagonists
in attenuating the wheal and flare response resulting
from epicutaneous or intradermal administration of
histamine in these individuals (14, 16). Numerous
pharmacodynamic studies have also demonstrated
that a single intake of 10 mg cetirizine, the normal
daily therapeutic dose, is highly potent and prevents
the formation of wheals and flares for several hours
after dosage.

Chemical analysis of cetirizine has demonstrated
that it is a racemate preparation composed of equal
quantities of the levocetirizine and ucb 28557
enantiomers, but, to date, there is no information
on the efficacy of either enantiomer in the treatment
of urticaria. Consequently, the aim of this study was
o compare the effect of the racemic mixture with the
wo enantiomers of cetirizine on histamine-induced
skin wheal and flare reaction in healthy volunteers.
However, since a therapeutic dosage of 10 mg
cetirizine has been shown to inhibit completely up
o 100 mg/ml histamine-induced skin wheal and flare
reactions in human volunteers, at 2-12h after
administration, it was essential that a dose lower
han 10 mg cetirizine be investigated in order to
observe any equivalence of pharmacodynamic action
between cetirizine and one of its enantiomers.
Consequently, since this was an equivalence study
design, the effects of a single oral dose of 5 mg

cetirizine (the EDs) of the recommended 10-mg

and 2.5-mg oral doses of each enantiomer were
investigated.

Material and methods
Subjects

Nineteen healthy white male volunteers entered the study, of
whom one withdrew after the first treatment for personal reasons.
The 18 volunteers who completed the study were of average frame,
with a mean age of 26.4 years (range 18-41 years), and all
demonstrated a histamine-induced mean skin wheal diameter of
>8 mm by skin prick test with 100 mg/ml histamine solution.
None of the volunteers, however, was skin prick test positive to
any of the common allergens, including house-dust mite, animal
dander, and grass and tree pollen. Similarly, none of the
volunteers demonstrated any reaction to skin puncture without
the histamine solution (negative control). On entry, none of the
volunteers showed any sign of illness, as indicated by medical
history and examination; they had normal ECG, and clinically
acceptable serum/urine biochemistry, haematology, and serology;
and none were taking any prescribed or investigation medication
during the 2-4 weeks preceding enrolment. All volunteers’ backs
were also checked to ensure the absence of skin blemishes such as
acne, tattoos, and hair, the presence of any one of which
constituted a study-exclusion criterion.

Eleven of the volunteers were smokers, and 17 volunteers
consumed alcohol in moderation. All volunteers gave written
informed consent before entry into the study, which was approved
by the Independent Review Board of the Besselaar Clinical
Research Unit, Leeds, UK.

 

Study design

This was a double-blind, three-treatment, crossover study. After
the screening visit, each eligible volunteer was entered into a
randomization schedule to receive 2.5 mg levocetirizine, 2.5 mg
ucb 28557, and 5.0 mg cetirizine, and was investigated as a
member of series groups of nine volunteers, each dosed on three
separate occasions. Each group of individuals attended the clinic
in the evening of the day before the dosing day, and each
volunteer was subjected to a urine drug screen, including alcohol
and cannabinoids. The volunteer was provided with a meal and
accommodation for overnight stays, and was scheduled for dosing
and testing the following day.

A baseline skin prick test was performed on the volunteer’s
back with 100 mg/ml histamine solution before dosing, and then
again at several time points from | to 32h after dosing. The test
was performed at a different site each time, and the area of the
skin wheal and flare was measured after each test. A negative skin
prick test (puncture without the histamine solution) was not
performed, since none of the volunteers had demonstrated any
reaction during screening. Blood samples of 5 ml were taken by
venepuncture of a forearm vein before dosing, and at 4 and 8h
after dosing, for analysis of the study drugs.

Similarly, urine samples were also collected for analysis of the
study drugs at 0-1 h before dosing, and then at any time during
time spans of 0-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-24, and 24-32 h after dosing.

The volunteers returned to the clinic on two further occasions
after intervals of 7 days, and the experimental procedure was
repeated before dosing with the second and the third treatment. A
set menu of breakfast, lunch, evening meal, and a light snack was
served to each volunteer at 2, 5, 10, and 13 h, respectively, after
dosing, during each study period.

Skin prick test

Skin prick tests were performed on the upper half of volunteers’
backs before dosing and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 32 h after
dosing. A droplet of 100 mg/ml histamine solution was placed on
an untested site and administered into the skin by piercing the
superficial skin with a sterile lancet. The droplet was gently wiped
off after 1 min, and the wheal and flare reaction was visualized
under a bright lamp after 15 min. The size of the wheal and flare
was outlined with thin-tipped marker pens and then traced onto
an acetate sheet to make a permanent record, which was used later
for analysis of areas of the wheal and flare. The area of the wheal
and flare was measured by computerized planimetry, by a person
blinded to the study protocol, and expressed as square millimetres.

Measurement of cetirizine, levocetirizine, and ucb 28557 in blood
and urine samples

Blood samples were collected into 5-ml lithium heparin vacutainer
tubes (Becton-Dickinson Ltd, Oxford, UK) and centrifuged at
1500 g for 10 min at 0-5°C. The plasma was aspirated carefully
and stored in polypropylene tubes at —20°C before analysis by
achiral HPLC. Urine samples were collected in preweighed
polypropylene containers; after the weight of each sample was
recorded, 20-ml samples were stored in duplicate in polypropylene
tubes at —20°C until analysis by both chiral and achiral HPLC.

 

Determination of levocetirizine, ucb 28557, and cetirizine in plasma
samples (achiral procedure). Volumes of 100 wl of 10 pg/ml ucb
26255 (the internal standard) and 1 ml of Imol/l citratephosphate buffer, pH 5.1, were added to 1-ml aliquots of
plasma samples, diluted, if necessary, by blank plasma.
Levocetirizine, ucb 28557, cetirizine, and the internal standard
present in the samples were extracted twice with 3 ml ethyl
acetate, and phosphoric acid (1.7% v/v, 0.5 ml) was added to
the pooled organic extracts. After thorough mixing, the mixture
was centrifuged at 3000 g for 5 min to separate the acidic and
the organic phases. The organic phase was discarded, and a
gentle stream of dry, oxygen-free nitrogen was passed over the
acidic extracts for a few minutes to remove any residual ethyl
acetate. The acidic extract was then transferred into vials for
autosamplers before analysis by HPLC, with a Hewlett-Packard
1090B liquid chromatograph equipped with a variable
wavelength detector. A volume of 150 pl of each sample was
injected onto a 220x4.6 mm (internal diameter) 5-1m Brownlee
Spheri-5 column, equipped with a MOS-hypersil (20x 4mm,
5 um) guard column, and chromatography was performed with
a mobile phase composed of KH»PO, (0.01 mol/l)/acetonitrile
(45/55 v/v) containing sodium octane sulphonate (0.02 mol/l),
and adjusted to pH 3. The flow was adjusted to 1.5 ml/min,
and the column was maintained at 50°C during
chromatography. Levocetirizine, ucb 28557, or cetirizine present
in the samples was detected at 230 nm, and estimated from a
calibration curve prepared from blank plasma samples spiked
with known amounts of the two compounds in a nominal range
of 10-750 ng/ml.

Determination of levocetirizine, ucb 28557, or cetirizine in urine
samples (achiral procedure). Aliquots (1 ml) of urine samples,
diluted if necessary, were transferred to 20-ml glass extraction
tubes, and mixed with 100 pl of the internal standard (ucb
26255, 30 ug/ml), citrate buffer (1mol/l, pH 5, 1 ml), and
chloroform (10 ml), in a shaker for 10 min. After mixing, the
samples were centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min. The organic
layer was transferred to a clean tube and evaporated to dryness
under a gentle stream of dry, oxygen-free nitrogen at 50°C. The
dry extracts were then reconstituted with 100-1 aliquots of
mobile phase and transferred into vials for autosamplers, before

52

analysis by HPLC, with a Hewlett-Packard 1090M liquid
chromatograph (series II) equipped with an HP 1050 variable
wavelength detector. A volume of 30 pl of each sample was
injected onto a 200x4.3 mm (internal diameter) 5-1um ODS
column, and chromatography was performed with a mobile
phase composed of H,O/methanol (35/65v/v) containing
tetrabutyl ammonium (Pic A low UV, 0.005 mol/l), at a flow
rate of 1.5 ml/min. The column was maintained at a
temperature of 50°C and the detector set at 235 nm during
chromatography. The amounts of levocetirizine, ucb 28557, or
cetirizine present in the samples were estimated from a
calibration curve prepared from blank plasma samples spiked
with known amounts of the two compounds in a nominal range
of 0.05 to 6 pg/ml.

 

Determination of levoceti and uch 28557 in urine samples
collected after cetirizine dosing (chiral procedure). Before analysis,
a 1.0-ml aliquot of each sample was mixed with 1.0 ml of 1
mol/l citrate buffer, pH 5.0, and 3.0 ml ethyl acetate for 10 min,
and then centrifuged at 3000g for 10 min. The upper organic
layer was transferred to a clean tube, and the aqueous phase
was extracted again with 3ml_ ethyl acetate. After
centrifugation, the two ethyl acetate phases were combined and
mixed with 0.5 ml H3PO, (1.7% v/v), for 10 min as above. The
aqueous phase derived from this mixture was evaporated to
dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen, and the sample was
reconstituted in 100 pl of the HPLC mobile phase before
analysis by HPLC. Calibration and quality control samples were
spiked with a known amount of cetirizine dihydrochloride, and
also processed as above.

Samples were analysed with a Hewlett-Packard 1090 DRS5
liquid chromatograph equipped with a HP 1050 variable
wavelength detector. A volume of 50 pl of each sample was
injected onto a 250 mm x 4 mm (internal diameter) 5-11m Chiracel
OD-H column (Daicel Chemical Industries Ltd, Tokyo, Japan),
equipped with a 10-4m Chiralcel OD 50x4 mm guard column,
and chromatography was performed with a mobile phase
composed of H,0:CH3CN (72.5:27.5, v/v). The aqueous fraction
of the mobile phase contained 0.01 mol/l KH,PO, and 0.02 mol/l
sodium octane sulphonate, and was adjusted to pH 2 with H3PO4
before use. The flow was adjusted to 0.6 ml/min, the oven
temperature was maintained at 40°C, and the detector was set at
230 nm during chromatography. The amounts of levocetirizine
and ucb 28557 present in the samples were estimated from a
calibration curve prepared from blank urine samples spiked with
known amounts of the two compounds in nominal ratios of 70/30,
60/40, 50/50, 40/60, and 30/70.

Statistical analysis

Per cent inhibition of the histamine-induced effect, after treatment
with the study drug, was calculated from the absolute values of
areas estimated for histamine-induced wheal and flare at baseline
(before treatment) and at each time point after treatment,
according to the following formula:

So—S,
1, = SoS) x 100
So

where So and S, are wheal/flare areas at time 0 (baseline) and at time
t, respectively.

The results for areas and per cent inhibition of histamineinduced wheal/flare for all individuals were expressed as mean
(+SEM) values for each time point, and plotted as time-response
curves for wheal and flare and per cent inhibition of these
responses. Each curve for the wheal/flare response at 0-32 h and
the per cent inhibition of these responses after treatment was
analysed for area under the curve (AUCo 32 and AUC-inho 4,
respectively), by the linear trapezoidal rule. The time curves
demonstrating inhibitory effects of the study drugs were also
evaluated for the time of maximum inhibition (fyax) and the
duration of the inhibitory effect observed with each drug. The
latter was determined by noting the time from when an inhibition
of >20% over baseline was first observed (fonser), to the time when
inhibition reverted to <20% over baseline (tena). The significance
of any differences between the curves for any two treatments was
tested by ANOVA for a two-period crossover design, and the
significance of any differences in tmax: fonsetr ANd feng and the
duration of inhibition was analysed by Wilcoxon’s rank sum test
on the treatment effect. Equivalence tests were also performed for
histamine-induced wheals and flares for AUCp 32, AUC-inho_a2,
and maximum inhibition, by the two one-sided tests of
Schuirmann (17, 18). These tests used a significance level of
0.05. The equivalence was accepted if the 90% confidence interval
of the ratio of means was fully included in the range 0.8-1.20.

The results for the amounts of each drug excreted in the urine
over a period of 0-32 h were expressed as cumulative amounts
and tested for significance of differences by ANOVA for a twoperiod crossover design.

Results

Effect of treatment with cetirizine, levocetirizine, and ucb 28557 on
histamine-induced wheal and flare

The mean areas of histamine-induced wheal and flare
are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. The baseline
wheal and flare areas were not found to be
significantly different before treatment with any of
he three study drugs. Treatment with oral cetirizine
(5 mg) and oral levocetirizine (2.5 mg) progressively
decreased the size of the wheals and flares induced by
histamine as the time after treatment was increased
rom 0 to 32 h. In contrast, treatment with oral ucb
28557 (2.5 mg) did not alter the size of histamineinduced wheals and flares over this period.
Estimation of the per cent inhibition of the
histamine-induced wheal and flare response confirmed
hat cetirizine and levocetirizine, but not ucb 28557,
were active in this respect. The inhibition profiles of
histamine-induced wheal for cetirizine and levocetirizine demonstrated that they were comparable
(Fig. 3). Inhibition of the wheal by cetirizine and
evocetirizine was apparent and pronounced (22.5%
and 30.2%, respectively) by 1h after dosage, and
maximal (79.5% and 83.8%, respectively) at approximately 6h after dosage. Although the mean onset
ime for inhibition for both compounds was found to
be 1.6h after dosage, and both compounds were
effective over the entire period of 32h investigated,
evocetirizine caused a greater wheal inhibition of
40.2% at 32 h after dosage, compared with the 24.3%
inhibition caused by cetirizine. Similarly, the mean
duration of the inhibitory response was found to be
slightly prolonged at 28.4h for levocetirizine, compared with 24.3 h for cetirizine.

Analysis of the inhibitory profiles for histamine
 

Effect of cetirizine, levocetirizine, and ucb 28557

induced flare demonstrated that these were also
comparable for cetirizine and levocetirizine (Fig. 4).
Cetirizine and levocetirizine, respectively, inhibited this
response by 13.4% and 10.2% by | h after dosage, and
maximally by 88.5% and 83.6% by approximately 6 h
after dosage. Inhibition of the flare was also apparent
over the entire 32-h study period, but in contrast to the
effect on wheal, the effect on flare was found to be
greater at 36.1% for cetirizine than the 24.5%
inhibition observed for levocetirizine at 32h after
dosage. Although the mean onset time for inhibition
of the flare for cetirizine and levocetirizine were
comparable at 1.9 and 2.0 h, respectively, the mean
duration of the inhibitory response for cetirizine was
found to slightly prolonged at 28.4 h, compared with
26.0 h for levocetirizine.

However, statistical analysis of the inhibitory
profiles of cetirizine and levocetirizine demonstrated
that with the exception of AUC-inho 32, for wheal,
there were no significant differences in percentage of
maximum inhibition, time of maximum inhibition
(tmax), Onset time (fonset), end time (feng) and duration
of inhibition of the wheal or flare for the two
compounds (Table 1).

The assessment of equivalence between cetirizine
and levocetirizine (as indicated by 90% confidence
interval fully contained in the range of 0.8-1.20 of the
ratio of means) demonstrated these compounds to be
similar in potency with respect to the maximum
inhibition they achieved on histamine-induced wheal
and flare. However, assessment of equivalence in
AUC-inhg_32 and AUCp_32 between cetirizine and
levocetirizine was not established for either wheal or
flare (larger 90% CI in flare). A greater inhibitory
effect on histamine-induced wheal (AUC inhg_32) was
observed for levocetirizine than for cetirizine (superequivalence for wheal area, as the ratio levocetirizine/
cetirizine was 1.47, with 90% CI [1.16-1.79]). This
was related to the longer pharmacodynamic effect of
levocetirizine than cetirizine (Table 2).

Determination of cetirizine, levocetirizine, and ucb 28557 in plasma
and urine

The retention times for levocetirizine and ucb 28557,
under the chromatographic conditions used, were
38 and 34 min, respectively. Adjusted recovery from
spiked plasma and urine control samples was found
to be 90-100% for each enantiomer. The technique
was highly reproducible, as indicated by the withinstudy variability of 10.5% and 6.9% for plasma and
urine samples, respectively. Similarly, achiral analysis
demonstrated that 95-101% of levocetirizine, and
97-102% of ucb 28557 were recovered from spiked
urine samples.

Analysis of plasma samples from all volunteers
demonstrated that each study drug was detectable in

these samples at 4 and 8h after dosage, thereby
confirming the compliance with treatment randomization and dosing schedules. Indeed, plasma concentrations of cetirizine were similar to the summed plasma
concentrations of the two enantiomers given separately. However, analysis of the plasma concentrations (mean+SEM) of levocetirizine at 4h after
dosage (77.9+3.6 ng/ml) and 8h after dosage
(53.142.9 ng/ml) showed that these were higher
than plasma concentrations of ucb 28557 at 4h
after dosage (41.2+3.6 ng/ml) and 8h after dosage
(24.2 +3.8 ng/ml).

The mean cumulative excretion of levocetirizine
and ucb 28557, as determined by chiral analysis after
administration of cetirizine, was progressively
increased to 60.8% and 50.9% of the dose, respectively, at 32h after dosage. Statistical analysis
demonstrated that the mean cumulative excretion of
levocetirizine was significantly greater than the mean
cumulative excretion of ucb 28557 (P<0.02).

The mean cumulative excretion of levocetirizine,
when given as the single enantiomer, progressively

ucb 28557, when given as a single enantiomer,
progressively increased to 50.4% by 32h after
dosage, and was also not significantly different

Evaluation of safety

None of the 18 volunteers investigated experienced
any serious adverse events, and all tolerated the study
drugs well. Although a total of nine adverse events
were recorded during the study, there was no clearly
drug-related trend in the distribution of adverse
events. Five of these adverse events, including headache, blocked nose, blocked sinuses, dry cough, and
urticaria in the lower back were observed in four
individuals after treatment with cetirizine. One
individual experienced headache after treatment with
levocetirizine, and two individuals experienced headache and/or urticaria in the buttocks or arm/back
after treatment with ucb 28557.

2.5 mg levocetirizine causes a marked inhibition o
histamine-induced wheal and flare response in healthy
volunteers, an inhibition that is comparable to the
effect of 5 mg cetirizine. Both drugs appeared to be
comparable in activity in that inhibition is apparen
from the first assessment at 1 h after dosage to the
last assessment at 32h after dosage, and maxima
inhibition of 90-95% occurred at approximately 6 h
after dosage. Comparison of pharmacodynamic
effects has demonstrated equivalence for the two
compounds with respect to the maximum level o:
inhibition that can be achieved. In addition, our study
has demonstrated that the degree and time course o:
histamine-induced wheal and flare inhibition are
similar when levocetirizine is administered either
alone, as the single enantiomer, or as a racemic
mixture cetirizine. In contrast to treatment with
cetirizine and levocetirizine, treatment with ucb
28557 does not show any relevant or consistent
inhibition of the histamine-induced wheal and flare in
these individuals.

This is the first study to compare and contrast the

Effect of cetirizine, levocetirizine, and ucb 28557

effect of treatment with cetirizine and its enantiomers
on the skin wheal and flare response induced by
histamine or any other compound eliciting this effect
in human subjects. In view of the similarity of the
antihistaminic effects observed for cetirizine and
evocetirizine, and the lack of any effect for ucb
28557 in this pharmacologic model, these data suggest
hat the antihistaminic effects demonstrated thus far
or cetirizine in the management of allergic skin
conditions are likely to be due to levocetirizine.
Indeed, our findings indicate higher plasma concenrations for levocetirizine than ucb 28557 at either 4
or 8 h after dosage. These data also indicate a higher
urinary excretion ratio for levocetirizine than for ucb
28557. Moreover, the observation that treatment with
evocetirizine was generally well tolerated in these
healthy volunteers also suggests that this compound is
ikely to be safe.

Our results for cetirizine are in accordance with the
findings of others. Grant et al. (19) have recently
performed a double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled, crossover study to compare the inhibition
profiles of various second-generation Hy-antihistamines, including cetirizine, ebastine, epinastine,
exofenadine, terfenadine, and loratadine, on the
histamine-induced cutaneous response in 14 healthy
male volunteers. All volunteers were treated with a
single recommended therapeutic oral dose of each
antihistamine, with a 1-week washout period between
each treatment, and after treatment, they underwent
he histamine skin prick test several times over a
period of 0-24h. These authors demonstrated that
inhibition of the histamine-induced wheal and flare
response by 10 mg cetirizine was evident by | h after
reatment and was still apparent after 24 h. Although
20 mg epinastine was found to have a faster onset of
action at 30 min after treatment, and the effects of
60 mg terfenadine appeared to be comparable to
hose of cetirizine, analysis of area under the curve
or wheal responses at 0-24 h for all drugs demonstrated that cetirizine was the most potent and
oratadine the least potent of all, with a rank order
of potency of cetirizine >epinastine > terfenadine >
ebastine > fexofenadine > loratadine > placebo.

Furthermore, these authors demonstrated that cetirizine caused greater than 95% inhibition of the
histamine-induced wheal response in 13 of the 14
individuals investigated. Similarly, Simons et al. (20)
have compared the inhibition profiles of several
antihistamines on histamine-induced wheals and
flares in 20 healthy white males, and have also
demonstrated cetirizine to be the most potent of all
he drugs investigated, with a rank order of potency
of 10 mg cetirizine>120 mg terfenadine>60 mg terenadine>10 mg loratadine>10 mg —astemizole>
4mg_ chlorpheniramine>placebo. These authors
demonstrated that although the inhibitory effects of
cetirizine on both the wheal and flare were apparent
by 30 min after treatment and lasted over the period
of 24 h investigated, the effect on wheal and flare was
significant by 1 and 0.7 h, respectively, after treatment. However, these authors also demonstrated that
cetirizine produced a maximum suppression of wheal
area of 94% and flare area of 89% at 5h after
treatment. Coulie et al. (21) have suggested that the
30-min onset of action time noted for cetirizine in
attenuating histamine-induced wheal and flare
responses correlates with the time at which the
concentration of this drug peaks in the plasma after
its intake.

Several double-blind, randomized, crossover comparisons of cetirizine and placebo or other antihistamines in the management of urticaria have also
demonstrated that cetirizine is significantly superior to
placebo, terfenadine, and astemizole in providing
faster/greater relief of pruritis, wheals, erythema, and
overall symptoms of chronic urticaria (14). Similarly,
studies of cetirizine in the nasal airways of healthy
volunteers and patients with seasonal/perennial allergic rhinitis have demonstrated that this compound is
significantly more efficacious than placebo, astemizole, ketotifen, loratadine, and terfenadine in also
providing relief from symptoms of rhinitis (22, 23).
Some studies of the effects of cetirizine in the nose,

 

56

however, have provided information in accordance
with the studies in the skin by demonstrating that the
inhibitory effects of cetirizine in the nose are also
evident at 1.5-24 h after intake (24, 25). Collectively,
these studies in the skin and nose suggest that the
antihistaminic effects of cetirizine, and its active
enantiomer levocetirizine, are unlikely to be organ
specific and are probably dependent on the plasma
concentrations to which they can rise in different
allergic conditions where histamine is known to play
a prominent pathogenic role.

In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that
single doses of cetirizine (5 mg) and its composite
enantiomers levocetirizine (2.5 mg) or ucb 28557
(2.5 mg) are safe and well tolerated in healthy
volunteers. Furthermore, this study has suggested
that the antihistaminic properties noted for cetirizine
in the management of allergic skin conditions are
likely to be due to the levocetirizine enantiomer, since
this compound presents very similar pharmacodynamic profiles to those observed for cetirizine.
Nevertheless, this remains to be confirmed in
individuals with allergic skin conditions. The use of
levocetirizine as a safe, well-tolerated, and highly
efficacious drug at only half the recommended dose of
cetirizine, for the treatment of allergic conditions,
may be a distinct possibility in the future.
