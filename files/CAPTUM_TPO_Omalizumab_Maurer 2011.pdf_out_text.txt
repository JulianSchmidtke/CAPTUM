Background: A subgroup of patients with chronic spontaneous
urticaria (CU) exhibits IgE antibodies directed against
autoantigens, such as thyroperoxidase (TPO). We conducted
this study to investigate whether such patients with CU with IgE
against TPO benefit from treatment with omalizumab, a
humanized anti-IgE mAb licensed for the treatment of severe
persistent allergic (IgE-mediated) asthma.

Objectives: We sought to assess the efficacy of omalizumab
treatment in patients with CU with IgE autoantibodies against
TPO.

Methods: In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study patients with CU (male/female, 18-70
years of age) with IgE autoantibodies against TPO who had
persistent symptoms (wheals and pruritus) despite standard
antihistamine therapy were randomized to receive either
omalizumab (75-375 mg, dose determined by using the
approved asthma dosing table) or placebo subcutaneously once
every 2 or 4 weeks for 24 weeks. The primary end point was the
change from baseline in mean weekly urticaria activity score
after 24 weeks of treatment, as calculated from patients’
diaries. The safety and tolerability of omalizumab were also
assessed.

Results: Of the 49 randomized patients (omalizumab, n = 27;
placebo, n = 22), 42 completed the study. At week 24, patients
demonstrated a mean reduction in the weekly urticaria activity
score from baseline of 17.8 with omalizumab and 7.9 with placebo
(P = .0089). Complete protection from wheal development was
observed in 19 (70.4%) patients in the omalizumab group

compared with only 1 (4.5%) patient in the placebo group. The rate
of adverse events was similar in both groups.

Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that omalizumab
is an effective treatment option for patients with CU with IgE
autoantibodies against TPO who are refractory to conventional
treatment. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2011;128:202-9.)

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CU) is acommon and disabling
disease characterized by recurrent, itchy, wheal and flare—-type
skin reactions; angioedema; or both.! H,-antihistamines are the
mainstay of symptomatic therapy. However, less than half of patients with CU achieve sufficient symptom control with antihistamines at standard doses, the only licensed treatment for cu.3

CU symptoms are brought about by the degranulation of skin
mast cells. During the past decade, several mechanisms of mast
cell activation in CU have been identified. For example, IgG
autoantibodies directed against IgE, which are detectable in a
subset of patients with CU, can cause cross-linking of mast cell—
bound IgE and subsequent mast cell degranulation.*° Another
subgroup of patients with CU exhibits IgG autoantibodies directed against the a-subunit of the high-affinity IgE receptor
FceRI on mast cells.**” Very recently, we have identified a subgroup of patients with CU who exhibit IgE autoantibodies against
thyroperoxidase (TPO), and IgE antibodies against TPO (IgE—
anti-TPO)-positive patients with CU exhibit significantly higher

Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized mAb that selectively
binds to the C3 domain of the IgE heavy chain (ie, the site where
IgE would bind to FceRI) and thereby reduces levels of free IgE in
serum.”"'° In addition, because occupancy of FceRI by IgE determines the levels of surface FceRI expression, reduced binding of
IgE to FceRI leads to a downregulation of FceRI expression on
mast cells and basophils.'''? Thus in patients with CU with
IgE antibodies against TPO, omalizumab could reduce or inhibit
mast cell activation by reducing the levels of these IgE autoantibodies, decreasing IgE receptor density on cutaneous mast cells,
or both. Therefore the present study was conducted to assess the
efficacy of omalizumab in patients with CU who exhibit IgE antibodies against TPO. In addition, the safety and tolerability of
omalizumab were also assessed.

METHODS
Study population

Male and female patients aged 18 to 70 years with a clinical diagnosis of
moderate-to-severe CU (as classified by the latest consensus guidelines from
the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology [EAACT],
the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network [GA7LEN], the European
Dermatology Forum [EDF], and the World Allergy Organization [WAO]'; ie,
those with persistent symptoms for >6 weeks despite receiving maximal inlabel antihistamine therapy) at screening, body weight between 20 and 150
kg, a total serum IgE level between 30 IU/mL or greater and 700 [U/mL or
less, a specific serum IgE-anti-TPO antibody level of 5.0 [U/mL or greater
within the last 3 months before randomization, and a weekly urticaria activity score (UAS) of 10 or greater at the end of screening were eligible for enrollment in the study. Serum IgE-anti-TPO levels were determined by using
a site-directed human IgE capture ELISA, as previously described.* The
UAS is a composite scoring system based on the patient’s diary by using numeric severity ratings from 0 to 3 (0, none; 3, intense) for the number of
wheals per 24 hours and the intensity of pruritus. The total daily score
(sum of the wheal and pruritus scores) could therefore assume any value
between 0 and 6."'!4

Patients were excluded from the study if they had acute urticaria, chronic
diarrhea, severe renal dysfunction, or increased serum IgE levels for reasons
other than allergy or urticaria. Patients with a history of epilepsy, allergy to
antibiotics, malignancy within the past 5 years, or cerebrovascular attacks or
ischemia or who had taken oral or parenteral corticosteroids, methotrexate,
cyclosporine, or other immunosuppressant medications during the 4 weeks
before screening were also excluded.

Study design and treatments

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study
was conducted at 16 centers in Germany. It was approved by the ethics
committee of each participating study center and was conducted in accordance
with the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good
Clinical Practice, the ethical principles embodied in the Declaration of
Helsinki (1989), and applicable local regulations. Written informed consent
was obtained from all patients before their participation in the study.

The study comprised a prescreening visit, a 3-week screening period
(divided into 2 phases), and a 24-week double-blind treatment period. At the
prescreening visit, informed consent was obtained, and patients were assessed
for eligibility. Patients received 10 mg/d loratadine and 1 mg clemastine as
rescue medication (maximum of 3 tablets per day) for 1 week during the first
phase of the screening period to select for patients with CU with symptoms
that cannot be controlled by maximal in-label therapy (ie, oral antihistamines).
Patients demonstrating uncontrolled disease activity (UAS >0) during any of
these 7 days were subsequently entered into the second phase of screening,
during which they received antihistamines (10 mg of loratadine on demand
and, if still symptomatic, up to 3 tablets of 1 mg/d clemastine) for 2 weeks.
Those demonstrating a weekly UAS of 10 or greater at the end of the second
phase of screening were subsequently entered into the randomized, doubleblind treatment period.

At baseline, eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to treatment with
omalizumab or placebo. Randomization was performed by using a validated
system that automated the random assignment of the treatments to randomization numbers in the specified ratio. Omalizumab (75-375 mg) or placebo
was administered subcutaneously once every 2 or 4 weeks for 24 weeks. The
doses were individualized for the patients based on their body weights and
total serum IgE levels at screening and were derived from the approved asthma
dosing table for omalizumab.'> Treatment allocation was concealed from the
patients, investigating staff, and clinical trial team by using study drugs that
were identical in packaging, labeling, schedule of administration, and
appearance.

No medications other than H,-blocking antihistamines, such as 10 mg of
loratadine on demand and | mg of clemastine as rescue medication, were
permitted.

 

Assessments

During the screening and treatment periods, patients were asked to record
daily scores (based on duration, size, number, and/or intensity) for wheals,
pruritus, erythema, and angioedema and to report concomitant medication use
(loratadine and clemastine) by using a paper diary.

Efficacy assessments included calculation of UAS from the patients’ diaries. Because of frequent variations in disease intensity during the course of
a day, the assessment of overall disease activity was based on a weekly aggregate UAS (ie, the sum of the daily UAS self-evaluation scores of 7 individual
days, which could range between 0 and 42 per week, as described previously).'°'7 The primary efficacy end point was the change from baseline in
mean weekly UAS after 24 weeks of treatment. Secondary efficacy end points
included the standardized area under the curve (AUC) of UASs over 24 weeks;
daily scores for wheals, pruritus, erythema, and angioedema; use of concomitant medication; and the patient’s and investigator’s global assessment of
symptoms using a graded Likert scale (0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; and 3,
severe). In addition, the patient’s health-related quality of life was evaluated
by using previously validated instruments, such as the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI),'* Skindex-29,'° and the Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life
Questionnaire (Cu-Q2o0L).”° The DLQI is a compact questionnaire consisting
of 10 items under 6 headings: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure,
work/school, personal relationships, and treatment. Each item is scored on a
4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3. An overall DLQI score (range, 0-30) is calculated by summing the scores for each item. A higher score is considered an
indicator of greater impairment in health-related quality of life.'* Skindex-29
consists of 29 items categorized into 3 domains, including physical symptoms,
social functioning, and emotional state. An overall quality-of-life index score
(range, 0-100) is obtained by adding the scores from the 3 domains, with
higher scores indicating poorer quality of life.'? Although the DLQI and

Skindex-29 are instruments used to measure the health-related quality of life
of any dermatology patient, the Cu-Q2oL has been specifically developed for
use in patients with CU and encompasses the physical, emotional, social, and
practical domains that characterize this condition. The German version of the
Cu-Q2oL consists of 23 items categorized under the following scales: limits
looks, swelling/eating, functioning, sleep, mental status, and itching/embarrassment.””*! Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale.

Safety assessments included the recording of adverse events (AEs) and
serious AEs, along with evaluation of their severity, duration, and relationship
to the study drug. In addition, urinalysis, regular monitoring of hematology
and blood chemistry results, pregnancy tests, and assessment of vital signs and
body weight were performed.

 

Statistical analyses

This trial was designed as a proof-of-concept trial with a clear focus on
exploration rather than statistical testing. The sample size was chosen in a way
that the test for the primary end point, the mean weekly UAS, would have 86%
power by using a 2-sided 5% significance level if the treatment effect (ie, the
difference between the treatment groups) was at least as large as its SD
(standardized effect size, >1). This was considered a very large effect.

All efficacy analyses were performed on the intention-to-treat population,
which included all randomized patients who received at least | dose of study
drug and had postrandomization primary efficacy data. Demographic and
baseline characteristics were summarized for all patients in the safety
population, which consisted of all patients who received at least 1 dose of
randomized study drug and had at least 1 postbaseline safety assessment. The
primary end point (mean weekly UAS) was evaluated by using an analysis of
covariance model with the factors of treatment and center and with the
baseline score as the covariate. For the treatment contrast between omalizumab and placebo, a 95% CI and a 2-sided P value were calculated.

Similar analysis of covariance models were used to analyze the standardized UAS AUC and the daily scores for wheals, pruritus, erythema, and
angioedema. The other secondary variables (the DLQI, Skindex-29, and
Cu-Q2oL questionnaires; concomitant and rescue medication use; and the

patient’s and investigator’s global symptom assessments) were summarized
descriptively. AEs, laboratory data, and measurements of vital signs were
summarized descriptively by treatment group. Data were analyzed with
SAS version 8.2 statistical software for Windows (SAS Institute, Inc,
Cary, NC).

RESULTS

Patient disposition is presented in Fig 1. Between May 2007
and May 2009, 341 patients were screened for this study; of those
patients, 49 were randomized. More than 95% of the patients who
were screened but not randomized were not included in the study
because their total serum IgE levels were less than 30 IU/mL, their
specific serum IgE-anti-TPO antibody levels were less than
5.0 IU/mL, the recruitment of patients for the study was stopped,
and/or the weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7) was less than 10
(Fig 1). During the study, all patients received at least 1 dose of the
assigned medication, and no patient received the study drug in
error; thus the safety population was identical to the intentionto-treat population. Forty-two (85.7%) patients completed the
study. Major protocol deviations were reported in 18 (36%)
patients, which mainly consisted of premature discontinuations
(Fig 1), lost diary data (n = 6), or deviations from the visit
schedule (n = 5). Table I represents the demographics and baseline clinical characteristics of all randomized patients. The mean
age of all patients was 40.5 years. All patients were white, and the
majority (77.6%) of them were female. The mean IgE—anti-TPO
antibody level was 6.9 + 4.25 IU/mL.

Patients experienced a reduction in UAS7 scores from baseline
to week 24 of 17.8 under omalizumab and 7.9 under placebo (least
squares means); the difference of 9.9 points between treatment
groups was statistically significant (95% CI, 2.7-17.1; P = .0089)
and clinically relevant (Fig 2, A). The actual UAS7 values (means

and 6.8 + 10.0 after treatment (placebo group: 21.3 + 7.6 at baseline and 15.5 + 11.0 after treatment). Fig 2, B, shows the mean
daily UASs over the 24-week treatment period. In contrast to placebo, those receiving omalizumab experienced a marked reduction in UAS during the first week of therapy, and the mean
UASs in the omalizumab group continued to decrease through
week 24 (day 169). The standardized UAS AUC over 24 weeks
was significantly lower for omalizumab than placebo (P <.001).

The number and intensity of wheals, pruritus, erythema, and
angioedema were lower in those receiving omalizumab compared
with those receiving placebo (see Tables E1 and E2 in this article’s
Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). After week 24, patients receiving omalizumab demonstrated a significant reduction
in the score for wheals (least squares mean, —9.2 vs —3.3; P =
.0019), and a complete protection from wheal development was
observed in 19 (70.4%) patients in the omalizumab group compared with only 1 (4.5%) patient in the placebo group. Similarly,
complete absence of pruritus, erythema, and angioedema was observed in 16 (59.3%), 18 (66.7%), and 21 (77.8%) patients, respectively, in the omalizumab group compared with only 2 (9.1%), 4
(18.2%), and 8 (36.4%) patients, respectively, in the placebo
group.

Treatment with omalizumab resulted in a substantial decrease
in mean concomitant medication use, from 2.9 loratadine tablets
and 6 clemastine tablets taken in the 7 days before randomization
to 0.3 loratadine tablets and 0.7 clemastine tablets taken during
week 24 (see Fig El in this article’s Online Repository at www.
jacionline.org). The corresponding values in the placebo group
for loratadine and clemastine use were 3.5 and 6.1, respectively,
in the 7 days before randomization and 3.3 and 1.4, respectively,
at week 24 (Fig El).

According to patients’ global assessments of symptoms, 59%
of those in the omalizumab group reported being symptom free at
the end of the study compared with 14% in the placebo group
(Fig 3). The investigator’s global assessment of the patients’
symptoms corroborated the patients’ own assessment of symptoms. Substantial differences were again apparent between the
2 treatment groups; 67% of patients receiving omalizumab were
assessed as having achieved a complete resolution of urticariarelated symptoms after week 24 compared with 4% of placebo
recipients (Fig 3).

Fig 4 and Figs E2 and E3 (available in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org) show the percentage improvement
in the quality of life of the study participants as measured by the

 

 

MAURER ET AL 205

DLAQL Skindex, and Cu-Q2oL questionnaires. All 3 questionnaires
revealed a significantly greater improvement of quality-of-life for
patients receiving omalizumab compared with placebo (P <.01).

The overall incidence of AEs during the treatment phase was
81.5% (22/27) with omalizumab compared with 86.4% (19/22)
with placebo. The most frequent AEs (>5% of all AEs) were
diarrhea (omalizumab, n = 4 [14.8%]; placebo, n = 2 [9.1%]),
nasopharyngitis (omalizumab, n = 9 [33.3%]; placebo, n = 11
[50%]), and headache (omalizumab, n = 10 [37%]; placebo, n =
6 [27.3%]). The incidence of suspected drug-related AEs was
similar between those receiving omalizumab and placebo (22.2%
and 22.7%, respectively). One patient receiving placebo experienced SAEs (eye infection and angioedema) during the treatment
phase and was withdrawn from the study. There were no deaths
reported during the study. The number of patients with notable
changes in laboratory values during the study was small, and there
was no evidence of any clinically meaningful trends in the
laboratory estimates or vital signs associated with omalizumab
therapy.

DISCUSSION

An increasing number of reports demonstrating the utility of
omalizumab in patients with refractory CU have appeared
recently in the medical literature.?*> However, the majority of
these are observational case reports and uncontrolled studies involving relatively few patients. We explored the clinical efficacy
and safety of omalizumab in patients with CU exhibiting IgE
against TPO by using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design. The dose and dosing frequency of omalizumab were based on the total serum IgE level and body weight,
which is consistent with those used for patients with allergic
asthma eligible for omalizumab therapy. The results of this study
showed that omalizumab significantly reduced disease activity,
decreased the need for additional medication to control symptoms, and improved patients’ health-related quality of life.

The significant benefit observed in IgE—anti-TPO-positive
patients with CU treated with anti-IgE suggests that IgE—antiTPO is critical for the development of urticarial symptoms in
these patients and that anti-IgE protects from urticarial symptoms
by reducing IgE—anti-TPO autoantibodies. Further studies, such
as skin testing or mast cell activation studies, are needed to
confirm and prove that IgE—anti-TPO does induce mast cell
degranulation and urticarial symptoms. Further studies are also
needed to test IgE—anti-TPO-negative patients with urticaria for
their response to anti-I[gE treatment and to explain the mechanisms and speed of action of anti-IgE in IgE—anti-TPO-positive
patients with CU. The current EAACI/GA?LEN/EDF/WAO
guidelines’ recommend assessing disease activity in patients
with CU by using 24-hour self-evaluation scores based on the
UAS system. In this study we used weekly UASs to evaluate overall disease activity. The decrease in mean weekly UASs with omalizumab in this study was 3 times that of placebo. A decrease in
UASs was observed during the first week of therapy and continued until the end of the study. This rapid improvement in disease
activity was observed in previous studies as well. Significant
clearing of urticaria within 1 week of starting omalizumab therapy was reported by Spector and Tan”* in patients with refractory
CU who had earlier received different combinations of antihistamines, antileukotrienes, H2-blockers, and lipoxygenase inhibitors
with little or no success. In this case series, however, omalizumab

was used at higher doses than recommended in patients with
allergic asthma.

In this study, in addition to significant reductions in weekly
UASs, omalizumab resulted in complete protection against the
appearance of wheals in 70% of the treated patients based on data
from the patients’ diaries. Similar observations were made with
regard to the complete resolution of pruritus, erythema, and angioedema. In addition, according to the patients’ global assessment
of symptoms, more than half of those in the omalizumab group
were symptom free at the end of the study compared with approximately one tenth of those in the placebo group. These observations were paralleled by the investigator’s global assessment of
symptoms. Kaplan et al?> studied the effects of omalizumab in
12 patients with chronic autoimmune urticaria refractory to antihistamine therapy. Approximately 60% of these patients achieved
complete remission by the end of the 16-week treatment period.
Furthermore, in a case report of a patient with severe CU for about

10 years,” the first injection of omalizumab yielded 90% control
of symptoms, and after the second injection, which was administered 4 weeks after the first, the patient was totally symptom free.
The frequency of use of rescue medication for symptomatic
relief provides an indication of the degree of clinical impairment.
Kaplan et al®° reported a significant decrease in rescue medication
use from baseline to the conclusion of their study in patients receiving omalizumab (P = .004). In our study treatment with omalizumab markedly reduced the burden of repeated rescue
medication use. The use of omalizumab was associated with an
overall reduction in the use of loratadine and clemastine from 3
and 6 times, respectively, per week at the beginning of the study
to less than once a week at the end of the treatment period.
Available data suggest that CU has a detrimental effect on both
objective functioning and subjective well-being.” Furthermore,
both health status and subjective satisfaction are lower in patients
with CU than in healthy subjects and patients with respiratory

allergies.”’ By providing rapid control of symptoms and decreasing the burden of additional medications, omalizumab can provide benefits that are relevant to patients, offering them the
prospect of significant amelioration of their disease experience.
Indeed, assessment of health-related quality of life by using evaluative instruments specifically designed for skin diseases, such as
the DLQI and Skindex-29, suggested that the observed clinical
benefits with omalizumab might translate into improvements in
the patients’ quality of life. In particular, the DLQI and Skindex
assessments revealed a significantly greater improvement of
45% to 50% in the quality of life of patients receiving

omalizumab compared with 6% to 11% in those receiving placebo. Similar improvements in the functional capacity and
well-being of patients with CU have been demonstrated previously by using the DLQI”* and Skindex-29°* questionnaires.

A banding system has been suggested to assist the clinical
interpretation of DLQI scores.”° Based on this system, in the current study omalizumab decreased the influence of CU on the
patients’ lives from a very large effect to a small one. On the contrary, there was no such change in patients receiving placebo.
Moreover, in patients with CU, a difference in overall DLQI
scores in the range of 2.24 to 3.10 has been proposed as a minimal
208 MAURER ET AL

clinically important difference.*° In this study the mean change in
DLQI scores between omalizumab and placebo after week 24 was
4.8, which exceeded the minimum clinically important difference. In addition, assessment of the effect of treatment on the individual Skindex-29 domains also demonstrated that all scores
were significantly improved after 24 weeks of treatment with
omalizumab in contrast to placebo, with the degree of improvement of functional impairment being similar to the improvement
in the burden on symptoms and emotions.

In addition to the DLQI and Skindex questionnaires, a diseasespecific questionnaire, namely CU-Q2oL, was used in this study.
The results observed with the CU-Q2oL questionnaire (55%
improvement with omalizumab vs 6% with placebo) were similar
to those seen with the DLQI and Skindex questionnaires, indicating
a significant enhancement in the overall quality of life of patients
with CU receiving omalizumab but no meaningful improvement in
those treated with placebo. Interestingly, the distribution of the
different CU-Q2o0L domain scores indicated that the extent of
improvement with omalizumab was of a higher magnitude on the
functioning and itching/embarrassment item bundles than on the
other scales. Each of the CU-Q2oL scales discriminated clearly
between omalizumab and placebo, with the effect sizes for
omalizumab being markedly superior to those for placebo.

In terms of overall safety, all treatments in this study were safe
and well tolerated. The overall rate of AEs was comparable
between omalizumab and placebo. The most frequent AEs were
nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, and headache. In patients with allergic
airway disease, local injection-site symptoms, most commonly
bruising and itching, and anaphylaxis, presenting as bronchospasm, hypotension, or syncope, have been reported to occur after
subcutaneous administration of omalizumab*!* ie the incidence of
such AEs in this study was very low or nil. In addition, there were
no safety concerns with regard to any of the laboratory parameters
or any clinically relevant differences in vital signs between the
treatment groups.

Taken together, the results of our study indicate a consistency in
the effect of omalizumab across all defined outcome measures,
which underlines the internal validity of the study and suggests
that omalizumab might be a useful therapeutic option in patients
with CU with high levels of IgE-anti-TPO autoantibodies.
Other related clinical scenarios in which omalizumab has shown
promise include cold urticaria,** cholinergic urticaria,** solar
urticaria,*° heat urticaria’"* and symptomatic dermographisms.*? However, it should be emphasized that omalizumab is
currently not an approved treatment modality for these conditions,
and the potential side effects of this medication, including the risk
for anaphylaxis, should be evaluated thoroughly.”

In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that
omalizumab is an effective treatment option for patients with
CU. In addition, omalizumab had a good overall safety and
tolerability profile in these patients. The results of this study
support the recommendation of the latest EAACI/GA*LEN/WAO/
EDF guidelines” to use omalizumab in the treatment of patients
with CU who do not sufficiently respond to standard therapy.

We thank Jodie Urcioli for proofreading the manuscript.

Clinical implications: Omalizumab shows strong efficacy and a

very good safety profile in the treatment of patients with CU
with IgE autoantibodies against TPO.
