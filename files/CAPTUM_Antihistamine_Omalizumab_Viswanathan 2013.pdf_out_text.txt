ABSTRACT

Omalizumab has been shown to be effective in chronic urticaria (CU) patients in numerous reports. However, it remains
unknown whether there are specific phenotypes of CU that are more responsive to omalizumab therapy. We sought to identify
CU phenotypes responsive to treatment with omalizumab by characterizing patients and their response patterns. A retrospective chart review analysis of refractory CU patients unresponsive to high-dose H,-blockers and immunomodulators and
subsequently treated with omalizumab at the University of Wisconsin Allergy Clinic was performed with particular focus on
their autoimmune characteristics, response to therapy, and dosing parameters. We analyzed 19 refractory CU patients (16
patients failed or had toxic side effects to immunomodulators) treated with omalizumab with an overall response rate of 89%
(17/19). Of these 19 patients, 9 patients (47%) had a complete response, 8 patients (42%) had a partial response, and 2
patients (11%) had no response. In comparing the response patterns to omalizumab, we found no statistically significant
differences among “autoimmune positive” versus “autoimmune negative” patients. No statistically significant differences
in responses were observed when comparing demographic parameters including age, gender, IgE levels, or dosing regimen.
Our study shows that omalizumab has robust efficacy in refractory CU patients regardless of their autoimmune status,

age, gender, IgE levels, or dosing protocol.

hronic urticaria (CU) is a debilitating skin condition characterized by the presence of intensely
pruritic lesions occurring intermittently or continuously for >6 weeks that impacts millions of patients
worldwide. CU is thought to have the most impact on
quality of life of any allergic disease and is similar in
severity to triple-vessel coronary artery disease.” Because the cause of CU is not known, it is often referred
to as chronic spontaneous urticaria or chronic idiopathic urticaria. However, in 35-50% of patients, an
autoimmune mechanism with autoantibodies to the
a-chain of the high-affinity IgE receptor or IgE itself
may underlie the pathophysiology of the disease.°*
Numerous commercial basophil histamine release assays have been developed and are available to identify
an autoimmune etiology. In our previous retrospective
analysis of chronic idiopathic urticaria patients, we
found that a positive CU index (IBT-ViraCor Laboratories, Lenexa, KS) correlated with a refractory phenotype that is less responsive to the use of H,/H,-histamine receptor blockers with or without leukotriene

receptor antagonists.° Furthermore, we investigated
the usefulness of obtaining other surrogate autoimmune biomarkers such as an antinuclear antibody
(ANA) or antithyroid antibodies and found that the
combination of a positive ANA with either antithyroglobulin (ATG) or antimicrosomal (ATPO) antibody as
well as a positive ANA independently also correlated
with a refractory outcome, albeit to a lesser degree than
a positive CU index.®

Current guidelines recommend a stepwise approach
to the management of CU, initially, with the use of
nonsedating Hj,-antihistamines up to 4x Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)-approved dosing.’ Secondline therapy includes supplementation with H,-blockers
and leukotriene modifiers. Immunomodulators (cyclosporine, mycophenolate, tacrolimus, hydroxychloroquine, and sulfasalazine) are used as third-line agents to
help achieve control in many refractory patients. Given
the toxicity profile of these agents, there is interest in the
use of omalizumab for CU. Omalizumab is a humanized,
monoclonal antibody against the ce3 domain of IgE near
the binding site for FceRI and FceRII. Omalizumab is
approved for patients =12 years old. Interestingly, in the
past several years, omalizumab has seen its use expand
beyond the realm of asthma.®-!5 More importantly, recent studies of omalizumab in refractory CU have also
shown efficacy.!>'®

Because of its high cost, omalizumab will not be an
economically viable option for all CU patients. Therefore, determining “CU phenotype(s)” in which omalizumab is effective could identify subsets of patients for

which omalizumab would be the preferred choice. To
address this issue, we performed a retrospective study
of refractory CU patients treated with omalizumab at
our academic allergy clinic setting over the past 3 years
to identify CU phenotypes, if any, that are more responsive to omalizumab therapy.

METHODS

Study Design and Analyses

This study is a University of Wisconsin Health Sciences Institutional Review Board—approved retrospective review of patients with a diagnosis of CU who
were treated with omalizumab between 2009 and 2012.
CU was defined as having episodes of hives occurring
either intermittently or continuously for a period of >6
weeks. Patients were excluded if they had primarily
acute urticaria, food or drug-related urticaria, vasculitis (based on clinical symptoms and appearance of
persistent lesions), mastocytosis, or exclusively angioedema without evidence of urticaria. Demographic
data including age and sex were collected. Laboratory
data including IgE, ANA, ATG, ATPO, and CU index
levels were obtained. For all laboratory data obtained,
reference laboratory guidelines for normal levels were
used to define negative or positive tests. For IgE level,
two commercial laboratories were used with normal
reference ranges of 0-114 IU/mL and 0-180 IU/mL. A
value above each respective upper limit was categorized as “IgE elevated.” For the CU index, two commercial laboratories were also used with normal reference ranges of 0-10 and 0-16, and a value above each
upper limit was categorized as a positive result. Deailed information on urticaria medication use was colected including omalizumab dosing and duration for
all patients. Given that dose-ranging studies were not
available at the start of this study, omalizumab was
initially dosed using existing nomograms for asthma
based on IgE level and weight. However, some paients were subsequently treated with a fixed dose of
omalizumab. Response to omalizumab was based on a
review of the medical record and categorized as complete (full resolution of symptoms), partial (any subjective or objective improvement in symptoms), or
none.

Exact contingency table (r < c) analyses were perormed to determine statistical significance among the
correlations, and p < 0.05 was considered significant.
Not all patients had every biomarker measured, and
herefore analyses were performed using the respecive subset of patients.

Allergy and Asthma Proceedings

tients (7 male and 12 female subjects) treated with
omalizumab for CU (Table 1). The mean age of subjects
was 38.3 with a range of 8—69 years. The mean duration of therapy was 6.05 months with a range of 1-16
months. CU index was available for 17 of 19 subjects,
ANA in 15 subjects, ATPO in 12 subjects, ATG in 10
subjects, and IgE in 16 subjects. Sixteen of 19 subjects
had an antecedent use of an immunomodulator and
had either failed therapy or experienced a toxic side
effect prompting the use of omalizumab.

Correlation of Demographic Characteristics to
Omalizumab Response

Omalizumab was administered at either 2- or 4-week
intervals for varying time periods. Sixteen of 19 patients presented in this case series were treated with an
immunomodulator (cyclosporine, mycophenolate, tacrolimus, or hydroxychloroquine), and all 19 patients
required at least one steroid burst in the 6 months
before initiating omalizumab therapy.

Among various age groups, response patterns to
omalizumab were not significantly different (p = 0.40)
with 47% of subjects showing complete response, 42%
showing a partial response, and 11% showing no response. The majority of patients were >18 years old,
which reflects the natural predominance of CU in an
older population. No differences were observed in response patterns to omalizumab between different age
groups (Fig 1 A). We found similar response patterns
to omalizumab in male subjects (57% complete, 29%
partial, and 14% none) and female subjects (42% complete, 50% partial, and 8% none) as shown in Fig. 1 B.
The difference in response patterns between male and
female subjects did not achieve statistical significance
(p = 0.81).

Sixteen of 19 patients in our study had IgE levels
obtained. Among those patients, 6 had elevated IgE
levels and 10 had normal values. No statistically significant differences (p = 0.48) in response patterns to
omalizumab were noted between CU patients with
elevated and normal IgE levels (Fig 1 C). With regard
to omalizumab dosing protocol, 10 patients had nomogram-based dosing and 9 patients had fixed dosing with no statistically significant differences in
response patterns (p = 1.0) noted between either
protocol (Fig 1 D).

Autoimmune Status and Omalizumab Response

We examined omalizumab response patterns to
individual autoimmune biomarkers. As shown in
Fig. 2, no significant differences were observed in
response patterns to omalizumab when we correlated it individually to ANA, ATG, ATPO, or CU
index status of patients (p = 1.0, p = 0.4, p = 1.0, and

DISCUSSION

In this study of refractory CU patients, we report an
overall response rate to omalizumab treatment of 89%
with 47% showing a complete response, 42% showing
a partial response, and 11% showing no response. With
subgroups based on age, gender, IgE status, and dosing protocol, we observed that the response patterns to
omalizumab were similar with no statistically significant differences. In comparing the response to omalizumab based on autoimmune status, we found similar
proportions of complete and partial responders in “autoimmune positive” and “autoimmune negative” patients. When examining response based on individual
autoimmune biomarkers, we noted similar response
patterns to omalizumab in those patients with positive
ANA, ATG, ATPO, or CU index compared with those
with negative values. Therefore, refractory CU patients
had a robust response to treatment with omalizumab
regardless of autoimmune status, age, gender, IgE
level, and dosing protocol.

Current European Academy of Allergy and Clinical
Immunology and Global Allergy and Asthma European Network joint guidelines suggest a step-wise approach to the management of CU! Although this is
appropriate and adequate for a majority of patients, it
is inefficient and time-consuming for many refractory
patients. Although immunomodulators are an effective
option for these refractory patients, they have a toxicity
profile that raises concerns about the benefit-to-risk
ratio. Omalizumab has emerged as an effective alternative to this conundrum. Saini et al. reported on the
dose-dependent efficacy of omalizumab (75, 300, or 600
mg or placebo given once) for CU.'® Also, more re
450

cently, Buyukozturk et al. showed improvements in
symptom and quality-of-life scores in 14 adult patients
treated with omalizumab for 6-20 months.!” Similarly,
Nam et al. established significant improvements in
symptom scores, quality-of-life measures, and medication use (systemic steroids, immunomodulators, and
rescue antihistamines) in CU patients treated with
omalizumab for 24 weeks.”? A large placebo-controlled
multicenter phase III trial recently showed efficacy of
omalizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic
idiopathic urticaria who were unresponsive to H,-antihistamines at approved doses.!° The dose of omalizumab
used in these studies ranged from 150 mg once a month
to 375 mg every 2 weeks and was similar to doses used by
patients in our study. Although these results are striking, it remains prudent to consider omalizumab only in
those refractory patients who have failed traditional
first-/second-line therapies.

Because omalizumab is an expensive treatment option and not FDA-approved for this indication, it is not
a viable option for every CU patient. Therefore, its use
should be restricted to patients that could preferentially benefit from omalizumab therapy. We recently
published data indicating that the presence of a positive CU index or a combination of a positive ANA with
antithyroid antibody correlates with a refractory phenotype in CU.5* Also, a study by Magen et al. indicated
that refractory CU had a higher incidence of positive
autologous serum skin test and other laboratory features of low-grade inflammation and platelet activation.2’ Several studies have also shown efficacy of
omalizumab in specific phenotypes of CU. A report
published by Kaplan et al. in 2009 examined the efficacy of omalizumab in a selective cohort of 12 patients
who were designated as having an autoimmune basis
for their urticaria and noted improvement of symptoms in 11/12 patients.'° In addition, a case series
published by Ferrer et al. showed improvement in
eight “nonautoimmune” CU patients treated with
omalizumab.”” Maurer et al. have shown the efficacy of
omalizumab in a cohort of patients with IgE autoantibodies to thyroperoxidase.”* These studies enrolled patients based on the presence or absence of autoimmune
markers as inclusion criteria. In contrast, our study
included a mixed cohort of CU patients and examined
whether any specific autoimmune marker or clinical
characteristics would serve as predictor(s) of responsiveness to omalizumab. Our results are consistent
with the literature suggesting that all phenotypes of
CU are responsive to the use of omalizumab.

There are some limitations to our study, including a
retrospective design, small study population, and a
lack of standard protocol for the assessment and management of CU. Because of the retrospective nature of
this study, response was recorded as a categorical result (complete, partial, or none) based on a subjective

review of the medical record as opposed to using a
validated instrument for disease activity such as the
urticaria activity score.”* It is also possible that some of
our partial responders or nonresponders to omalizumab may have been prematurely categorized because of an insufficient duration of treatment. Therefore, it would be ideal to monitor subjects for a 6- to
12-month period on omalizumab therapy to gauge
their response patterns. Also, because a common protocol was not used, each patient did not have every
biomarker measured. The small sample size raises
questions of whether there are predictors that we were
not able to detect; however, given the high rate of
response to omalizumab, identification of positive or
negative predictor(s) will be very challenging.

Our study also included the use of omalizumab in an
8-year old boy. It should be noted that there is a paucity
of data for omalizumab in the pediatric population for
this indication. He had refractory CU with angioedema
that failed to improve with cyclosporine therapy and
required frequent steroid bursts. Omalizumab treatment
resulted in a complete resolution of symptoms.

There is considerable interest in understanding the
mechanism for disease improvement with use of
omalizumab. Previous studies have shown that omalizumab decreases free IgE levels and down-regulates
FceR1 expression on mast cells and basophils.”°7°
These mechanisms of action for omalizumab in CU are
insufficient explanations given that patients note an
improvement in symptoms within days of omalizumab
administration.'>"* It has also been proposed that
omalizumab may exert some of its effects through
direct basophil stabilization'® or have effects on pathogenic IgE antibodies,?” which may explain its rapid
onset of action or perhaps there remains an as-yet
undetermined mechanism.”®

Given the high cost for omalizumab, it will be prudent to consider omalizumab only in those refractory
patients who have failed traditional first-/second-line
herapies. With regard to safety, omalizumab is exceedingly safe to use as shown from studies in patients
with severe allergic asthma.””*° In our study population, one patient discontinued omalizumab because of
severe headaches. Aside from this event, no other adverse reactions were noted in our study subjects. Additional questions remain regarding dosing and duraion of omalizumab for refractory CU patients. The
dosing in asthma uses a nomogram based on IgE level
and weight to calculate the omalizumab dose for paients. Recently, it was indicated that a fixed dose of
omalizumab, independent of IgE level or weight, is
effective and sufficient for management of CU paients.'® In our study, 10 patients were treated using
nomogram-based dosing and 9 patients with fixed dosing protocol with no statistically significant differences in
response patterns. The duration of therapy and whether

 

Allergy and Asthma Proceedings

remission can occur remain unanswered questions. Our
mean duration of therapy was 6.05 months with a range
of 1-16 months. As stated previously, it would be prudent to treat such refractory patients for a duration of
6-12 months to ascertain their true response patterns. A
more recent study did show long-term efficacy for omalizumab in CU patients who were treated for 9-24
months.*! Future studies using a standardized protocol
and longer-term treatment inclusive of multiple CU phenotypes will be required to determine whether remission
can occur and the optimal dosing and duration needed to
achieve it. Given the current body of evidence for omalizumab in CU and its potential to induce remission, omalizumab, despite being an expensive alternative at present,
may in the long run help to defray health care costs for
refractory CU patients.
In conclusion, our study suggests that omalizumab has
robust efficacy in refractory CU patients regardless of
their autoimmune status, age, gender, IgE level, or dosing
schedule. Our findings reinforce the published data on
the use of omalizumab in CU patients. It is our hope that
the existing repository of data and future randomizedcontrolled studies will pave the way for a successful FDA
application and omalizumab will be included in our armamentarium to treat refractory CU patients.
