Abstract

Background: A standard dose of second-generation H1 -antihistamines is recommended as the first-line treatment of
chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), previous studies have found that approximately 20-50% of CSU children fail to control their symptoms and required step-up treatments.

Objective: To evaluate the predictors of uncontrolled symptoms with first-line medication and describe the treatment
outcomes of CSU children in the southern region of Thailand.

Methods: This retrospective chart review of CSU patients, aged 2-18 years, who were initially treated with the standard
dose of second-generation H1 -antihistamine at the Pediatric Allergy Clinic, Songkhlanagarind Hospital, from January
2008 to July 2018. The data were collected at the initial visit (demographic data, onset of rash, frequency of urticaria,
presence of angioedema, previous resolved CU, laboratory investigation results) and follow-up visits (treatment outcome,
time to controlled urticaria).

Results: The medical records of 192 CSU children were reviewed; their median age were 8.5 years and the mean frequency of rash was 4 days/week. Forty-seven children (24.4%) fail to controlled symptoms with a standard dose of second
-generation H1 -antihistamines and a factor significantly associated was frequency of rash for more than 4 days per week
(OR = 4.36, P < 0.001). The median time to controlled urticaria was 1.28 months.

Conclusions: Most of CSU children in the southern region of Thailand experienced controlled symptoms with a standard
dose of second-generation H1 -antihistamines, and the frequency of urticaria for more than 4 days per week was a factor
associated with uncontrolled symptoms that regimen.

Key words: chronic spontaneous urticaria, child, second-generation H1 -antihistamines, uncontrolled symptoms, risk

Introduction

Chronic urticaria (CU) entails the presentation of urticarial rash at least twice a week for longer than 6 weeks.’ CU is
classified as chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and inducible urticaria; CSU constitutes the majority of cases of CU.??
In the United Kingdom, the prevalence of CSU children
has been reported at 0.1-0.3%,* while the prevalence of CSU
children in Thailand is 13%.° CSU significantly affects the

quality of life of children and is associated with socioeconomic
burden.*

There are several guidelines for the management of CSU;
a standard dose of second-generation H1 -antihistamines is
recommended as the first-line treatment in all of the guidelines. If the patient’s symptoms cannot be controlled within
2-4 weeks, the options are up-dosing the second-generation

H1 -antihistamine by 2-4 folds, adding another second-generation H1 -antihistamine, adding a first-generation antihistamine at bedtime, adding an H2 antihistamine or adding a
leukotriene receptor antagonist. For cases resistant to these
treatments, adding cyclosporine A or omalizumab is indicated”?

Previous studies have found that approximately 20-50%
of children and 70-80% of adult CSU patients fail to control
their symptoms with a standard dose of second-generation H1
-antihistamine.'*'? Some studies have reported an association
between the presence of angioedema, drug allergy and family
history of CSU and uncontrolled symptoms with the standard dose of antihistamine.'°'! However, there are limited data
about predictors and treatment outcomes among children in
Thailand, who cannot control their symptoms with a standard
dose of second-generation H1 -antihistamines. The aim of this
study was to evaluate the predictors of uncontrolled symptoms
with a standard dose of second-generation H1 -antihistamines
and describe the treatment outcomes of CSU children in the
southern region of Thailand.

Methods
Study design and population

The medical records of CSU patients, aged 2-18 years, who
were diagnosed with chronic spontaneous urticaria and initially treated with the standard dose of second-generation H1
-antihistamine (cetirizine, loratadine, levocetirizine, desloratadine, fexofenadine) at the Pediatric Allergy Clinic, Songkhlanagarind Hospital, from January 2008 to July 2018, were
reviewed. The patients who had underlying diseases related
to urticaria or angioedema such as maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis, urticarial vasculitis, bradykinin-mediated
angioedema or cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, and
patients on immunosuppressive drugs were excluded.

We calculated the sample size necessary to detect the risk
factors of uncontrolled symptoms with a standard dose of
second-generation H1 -antihistamines using the formula for
testing two independent proportions (P1 - the proportion of
patients who had angioedema = 0.45; P2 - the proportion of
patients who did not have angioedema = 0.12, n2/n1 = 1)."
The results indicated a required sample of at least 34 per group.
Additionally, we calculated the sample size to detect the rate
of uncontrolled symptoms with a standard dose second-generation H1 -antihistamines using the formula for estimating
the infinite population proportion (P; rate of uncontrolled
symptoms with a standard antihistamine dose = 0.185).”
It was found that the overall sample size needed to be at least
232.

Data review from medical records

The data were collected from the medical records at the
initial visit consisted of demographic information (sex, age,
weight, height, drug allergy, current medications, past history
of atopy, and family history of atopy), onset of rash, frequency of urticaria (days/week), presence of angioedema, previous
resolved CU, laboratory investigation results (CBC, ESR, ANA,
anti-dsDNA, thyroid function test, skin prink test or sIgE to
aeroallergens) and type of second-generation H1 -antihistamine

drug. The data from medical records at follow-up visits were
consisted of treatment outcome and time to controlled urticaria. The treatment outcome of the standard dose of second-generation H1 -antihistamines was evaluated 2-4 weeks after the
start of treatment, and uncontrolled symptoms were defined as
the presence of urticaria at least 2 days/week while on the same
daily dose of antihistamine.

Statistical analysis

The data were recorded using Epidata and analyzed using
the R statistical software. The demographic data are presented
as mean+tstandard deviation or median (IQR) for continuous
data, and number (%) for categorical data. The rate of uncontrolled symptoms was presented as number (%) for categorical data. The predictors for uncontrolled symptoms were analyzed using the chi-square and Fisher's exact tests for sample
proportion comparisons and the T-test and Mann-Whitney U
Test to compare the sample mean/medians. The strength of
association was measured by means of odds ratios (OR) with
95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A P value of less than 0.05
was regarded as statistically significant. The categorical data
concerning medications used to control urticaria are presented
as number (%), while the time to control urticaria was tested by
using the time-to-event analysis.

Ethics statement

This study was approved by the Human Research Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University,
Thailand.

Results
Demographic data

The medical records of 192 CSU children were reviewed;
their median age were 8.5 years (Table 1). The proportions of
males and females were equal. The medium duration of urticaria before diagnosis was 4.5 months, and the mean frequency of urticaria was 4 days/week. Just under half of the children (46.9%) had angioedema. Seventy-two children (37.5%)

(9%); however, the anti-ds DNA test resulted negative in all
of them and none of the children had autoimmune disease.
Aeroallergen sensitization was evaluated in 113 children, and
just under half of them (49.4%) had positive results. The thyroid function test was performed on 114 children. However,
while 6 children had abnormal results as subclinical hypothyroid, none of the patient had autoimmune thyroiditis.

Treatment outcome of chronic spontaneous urticaria in children

All of the children were initially treated with a standard
dose of second-generation H1 -antihistamines, which comprised cetirizine (52.6%), loratadine (40.6%), desloratadine
(4.7%), fexofenadine (1.6%) and levocetirizine (0.5%). The
mean follow-up duration after the initial treatment with a
standard dose of second-generation H1 -antihistamines was
1 month. The prevalence of controlled symptoms with a
standard dose of second-generation H1 -antihistamines was
75.6%. Forty-seven children whose symptoms were uncontrolled symptoms received step-up treatment, and five children were lost to follow up. Thirty-five children (18.2%) had
their symptoms controlled with a double dose of second-generation H1- antihistamines. Six children achieved controlled
symptoms with higher doses of antihistamine; a three-fold
dosed in five persons and a four-fold doses in one person.
Otherwise, one person's urticaria symptoms were controlled
with a standard dose of second-generation H1- antihistamines
combined with a dose of first-generation H1 -antihistamines
at bedtime and an H2-antihistamine.

Overall, the median time to controlled urticaria was 1.28
months (1.08 months in the patients who experienced controlled symptoms with a standard dose of second-generation
HI -antihistamines and 2.83 months in the patients who failed
to have their symptoms controlled with this medication).

Risk factors for uncontrolled symptoms with a standard dose of
second-generation H1- antihistamines in chronic spontaneous
urticaria patients

The rate of uncontrolled symptoms with a standard dose
of second-generation H1- antihistamines was 24.4% and the
factors that might lead to uncontrolled symptoms are shown
in Table 2. A factor significantly associated with uncontrolled
symptoms with a standard dose of second-generation H1 -antihistamines was frequency of rash for more than 4 days per
week (P < 0.01).

However, the other risk factors such as presence of angioedema, previous resolved CU, personal or family history of atopy, drug allergy, and all of the laboratory investigation findings were not found to associate with uncontrolled
symptoms with this step of treatment.

Discussion

This cohort study on 192 children with CSU showed a rate
of 24.4% for uncontrolled symptoms with a standard dose
of second-generation H1 -antihistamines and a risk factor
associated with uncontrolled symptoms with this step of treatment was frequency of rash for more than 4 days per week.
However, the other risk factors, namely the presence of angioedema, previous resolved CU, personal or family history of
atopy, drug allergy and all of laboratory investigation findings,
did not reveal any association with uncontrolled symptoms
with a standard dose of second-generation H1 -antihistamines.
Almost all of the children achieved controlled symptoms with
an up-dosing to a double dose of a second-generation H1 -antihistamine drug, and the overall medium time to controlled
symptoms was 1.28 months.

According to the guidelines for the management of CSU,
a standard dose of second-generation H1- antihistamines is
recommended as the first-line treatment. If the patient’s symptoms are not controlled within 2-4 weeks, a step-up treatment
is indicated. In Thailand, Chansakulporn et al.,'? performed
a prospective study among 94 CSU children between 2003
and 2009 at Siriraj Hospital, and the results indicated that
18.5% of the patients did not have their symptoms controlled
with a standard dose of antihistamines. This was similar to our
study’s finding we found that 24.4% of our participants did
not respond to the initial treatment. However, our proportion
was lower than that of the study by Lee et al.,"° who performed
an observational prospective study in Singapore in 98 CSU
children and found that 50% of the patients failed to control their symptoms with a standard antihistamine dose. This
might be explained by the difference in the patients’ severity
of urticaria at baseline because this study enrolled patients
who had daily or almost daily urticaria symptoms for at least
6 weeks, while the medium frequency of urticaria in our study

 
Risk factors of uncontrolled urticaria SP»

 

was 4 days. When comparing our study with studies in adults,
Marin-Cabanas et al.,'' who performed a cross-sectional study
on 100 CSU adults, found 82% incidence of uncontrolled
symptoms with a standard dose of antihistamine. Such a high
rate of uncontrolled symptoms with the initial treatment in
this study compared to our study might owe to the fact that
this study had a higher rate of chronic autoimmune urticaria
(positive ANA 12%, positive antithyroid antibody 20%) than
our study (positive ANA 9%).

Furthermore, previous studies have evaluated the risk factors associated with uncontrolled symptoms with a standard
dose of second-generation H1 -antihistamines. Lee et al.,’°
found that angioedema, drug allergy and family history of
CSU were associated with uncontrolled symptoms. Likewise,
Marin-Cabanas et al.,'’ who performed a cross-sectional study
among 100 CSU adults, reported that the presence of angioedema was associated with a lack of response to treatment
with a standard antihistamine dose. In Thailand, the data
concerning the risk factors for uncontrolled symptoms with
a standard dose of antihistamine are limited. In our study, we
did not find any significant association between angioedema,
drug allergy and family history of CSU and uncontrolled urticaria symptoms in childhood.

According to our study, only the frequency of urticaria
for more than 4 days per week was an associating factor. The
activity scales that have been proposed to integrate symptom
intensity and its impact on daily life such as the Urticaria
Severity Score (USS) consist of 9 questions, and the number of days of urticaria is one of them. This indicates that the
frequency of urticaria is associated with the severity of the
disease, and it might affect the response to the initial treatment.

Based on the results of our study, if the patent has urticaria more than 4 days/week for at least 6 weeks, the treatment
should involve more than a standard dose of second-generation of H1 -antihistamines in order to control the patient’s
symptoms early. However, we need further studies to confirm
this hypothesis.

The strengths of this study lie with its large sample size
and low rate of loss to follow-up. There were some limitations in this study that are worth mentioning. Firstly, we did
not evaluate disease severity using UAS scores. However, we
employed an indirect assessment of the disease severity by
evaluating the frequency of rash and the patient’s symptoms.
Secondly, we did not perform ASST, which is used in the
diagnosis of CAU; however, this test is not usually carried out
in real practice because it is difficult to perform, and it does
not change the treatment. Finally, we enrolled only patients
who received a standard dose of second-generation H1 -antihistamines as an initial treatment. This might have introduced
a selection bias since we did not enroll patients with a more
severe disease that were referred to our hospital due to the
initial treatment failure.

In conclusion, most of our CSU patients experienced controlled symptoms with a standard dose of second-generation
H1 -antihistamines, and the frequency of urticaria for more
than 4 days per week was a factor associated with uncontrolled
symptoms that regimen.
