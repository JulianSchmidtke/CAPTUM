Summary

Background Chronic urticaria is a common skin disorder, which causes considerable morbidity. In
approximately 40% of cases, patients have an autoimmune disorder in which functional antibodies
cause degranulation of mast cells and basophils, and C5a complement augments this in varying
amounts from patient to patient. Since the calcineurin inhibitor ciclosporin has been used in chronic
autoimmune urticaria, we examined the effect of ciclosporin and other drugs on the release of
histamine from basophils when stimulated by sera from patients with chronic autoimmune urticaria.
Methods Leucocytes from healthy donors were isolated and incubated in varying concentrations of
ciclosporin, ascomycin, methotrexate, diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine for 30min prior to
stimulation with serum from urticaria patients known to have functional immunoglobulin (Ig)G
antibodies directed against the alpha subunit of the IgE receptor. Histamine release was then
measured.

Results Pre-incubating cells with ciclosporin and ascomycin produced dose-dependent inhibition of
histamine release when cells were stimulated by sera of urticaria patients, by purified IgG from these
sera, but not by CSa. Inhibition was not prevented by CSa receptor blocking antibodies. No
inhibition was seen with methotrexate, diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine.

Conclusions This is the first demonstration of inhibition of histamine release by calcineurin
inhibitors employing sera of patients with chronic autoimmune urticaria. These drugs may work by
interfering with intracellular signalling in cells following cross-linking of the IgE receptor, but not

following stimulation of the CS5a receptor.

Introduction

Chronic urticaria is a common skin disorder characterized by
widespread transient pruritic weals that recur from day to day
for 6 weeks or more, producing considerable morbidity [1, 2].
Greaves and co-workers [3] demonstrated it to be an
autoimmune disorder in at least 40% of patients, who possess
functional autoantibodies that cause cross-linking of immunoglobulin (Ig)E receptors on basophils and mast cells to
release inflammatory mediators and cytokines. Furthermore,
it has been shown that these chronic autoimmune urticaria
patients have more severe disease [4].

Treatment of chronic urticaria is a challenge and oral
antihistamines (H, receptor antagonists), even in high doses,
may not be effective [1]. Other additional therapies may
include H> receptor antagonists, leukotriene antagonists [5,
6], UVB phototherapy [7], hydroxychloroquine, dapsone,

methotrexate, plasmapheresis [8] or intravenous y globulin
[9]. However, none of these are reliably effective or are
prohibitive based on cost/availability considerations. For
severe cases, low-dose and alternate day systemic corticosteroids [1] have been recommended, and ciclosporin has also
been shown to be particularly effective in randomized
controlled trials involving the autoimmune subgroup. The
mode of action of calcineurin inhibitors, such as ciclosporin,
is, however, not clear [10].

In order to further examine mechanisms of action of some
of these drugs in chronic autoimmune urticaria, we have
assessed the effects of ciclosporin and ascomycin on basophil
histamine release [11] as stimulated with sera or isolated IgG
of patients.

Materials and methods

Leucocyte isolation

Leucocyte isolation was carried out as described previously
[11]: 1SmL of whole blood from a healthy donor was mixed
with 1.5mL of 0.2m EDTA and 3.0mL of 3% dextran-3%
glucose-0.15mM NaCl saline solution. After the mixture had

sedimented for 90min, the supernatant was transferred to
conical tubes and washed three times with HBSS-HSA
containing HBSS (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA),
0.3% human serum albumin and 4mm HEPES. Cells were
resuspended in the histamine release buffer from the
histamine ELISA kit (Immunotech International) at the
original leucocyte concentration.

Patients

Sera were selected from patients who had recurrent hives
occurring at least four times a week for more than 12 weeks,
with individual lesions lasting over 4h. None of the sera used
was from patients who had a physical urticaria or who had
urticarial vasculitis. None of the patients had recently taken
immunosuppressants, corticosteroids or tricyclic antidepressants, and patients had been off all medication, including
antihistamines for at least 4 days prior to venipuncture. The
patients chosen were clearly positive for chronic autoimmune
urticaria as assessed by histamine release from basophils.
Autologous skin tests were not employed. We did not
distinguish those with anti-[gE from those with anti-IgE
receptor antibody. This study was approved by the Investigational Review Board (IRB) of the Medical University of
South Carolina and informed consent was obtained from
each participant.

 

Purification of immunoglobulin G

Whole IgG was isolated from patent sera using protein G
(Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Histamine release from basophils and histamine assay

The same blood donor, who has a history of mild seasonal
allergic rhinitis but is otherwise well, was used as his cells are
known to be reactive to the stimuli of anti-I[gE, functional
anti-FceRIa, and complement C5a without initial IL-3
priming. 75 uL of serum, buffer, purified IgG or complement
C5a was incubated with 75 tL of whole leucocyte suspension
for 40 min at 37°C, as described previously [11]. Following
incubation, supernatants were separated by centrifugation at
1200 g at 4°C for Smin. Aliquots of cells in two dilutions
were boiled to determine the total histamine content of
basophils in the leucocyte preparations.

Histamine release was measured with an enzyme immunoassay kit (Immunotech International, Marseille, France),
according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The
average release from duplicate samples was calculated and
expressed as a percentage of total histamine content, after
subtracting the spontaneous release from both, which was less
than 5% of total histamine. The inhibition by pre-incubation
with various drugs was calculated by expressing the proportion of percentage release with drugs.

 

Drugs and chemicals

Ciclosporin, ascomycin, methotrexate, diphenhydramine and
hydroxyzine were purchased from Sigma pharmaceuticals.
Stock solutions of 0.01 M of all these were made in methanol
with the exception of ascomycin, which was dissolved in

ethanol. The reagents were bought at the highest grade
available. Drugs were further diluted by the histamine release
buffer used in the assay and 16.7uL of drug solution was
added to the leucocyte suspension for 30min at room
temperature prior to incubation.

Statistics

Statistical analysis was done employing Student’s /-test. A
P-value of <0.05 was considered significant.

Results

Calcineurin antagonists inhibit histamine secretion
stimulated by serum from chronic urticaria or isolated
immunoglobulin G but not by C5a

In order to study the effects of ciclosporin on histamine
release from normal human basophils, we first stimulated
cells with anti-IgE, as has been reported previously [12]. As
shown in Fig. 1, there is a dose-dependent inhibition of
histamine release between 100 (10-8) and 10000nM
(10~°m) ciclosporin. A maximum of over 70% inhibition
was noted. We then examined whether a similar result would
be obtained if chronic urticaria sera containing anti-FceRIa
antibody were used as the agonist. Figure 2 is representative
of one such serum in which a dose-dependent inhibition is
observed between 100 and 10000nM ciclosporin. We next
surveyed a series of patients at 1000 nm (10-7) ciclosporin
and found that all sera tested were inhibited (Fig. 3), with an
average inhibition of 53.8%. Since we know that the
pathogenic antibody is of the IgG class, we isolated IgG
from several patients to remove complement; thus, the effects
of IgG-induced stimulation alone could be observed. A
dose-dependent inhibition of histamine release is demonstrated in Fig. 4 employing one representative serum; the
results were similar in four of four such patients studied. By

contrast, when we stimulated basophils with CSa [13], we saw
no inhibition of histamine release by pre-incubation with
ciclosporin up to 1000 nm (Fig. 5). When we used anti-CD88
antibodies to block the CSa receptor and stimulated with the
serum from one patient (Fig. 6) we saw about 47% inhibition.
Pre-incubation with ciclosporin resulted in a further dosedependent inhibition of histamine release presumably because
of inhibition of the effect of anti-FceRI« antibodies. We next
examined the ability of ascomycin to inhibit histamine release

by sera from chronic urticaria patients. A dose-response
inhibition to urticaria serum is demonstrated in Fig. 7. There
is a strikingly similar dose-response inhibition noted in each
between 100nM and 101M ascomycin, and a dose of 100nM
ascomycin significantly inhibited all 11 sera tested (Fig. 8).
The average percent inhibition was 43.9, similar to that seen
in Fig. 3 employing ciclosporine (41.2% inhibition). However, the concentration of ascomycin employed was 10-fold
less. The antihistamines diphenhydramine and hydoxyzine,
and the immunosuppressant methotrexate, have no effect on
histamine secretion stimulated by serum from chronic
urticaria patients. Figure 9 demonstrates that no inhibition of histamine was observed by pre-incubating cells with
a wide concentration range (between | and 100000nm) of
these drugs.

Discussion

The ability of drugs including calcineurin inhibitors to inhibit
histamine release from basophils stimulated by anti-I[gE has
been studied previously [12, 14], but we are not aware of any
studies examining their action specifically in chronic urticaria.
Chronic autoimmune urticaria is dependent not only on the
cross-linking of IgE receptors (by anti-FceRI« or anti-IgE)
but also on the activation of complement [13]. Cross-linking

of IgE receptors leads to histamine release via a calcineurindependent signal transduction pathway, whereas complement
CSa receptors act through G-proteins. Histamine release by
patient sera or isolated IgG can be inhibited by ciclosporin
and ascomycin, but the contribution by complement is not.
Kikuchi and Kaplan [11, 13] reported that on average about
30% of histamine release in the basophil release assay may be
attributed to complement activation, although this is variable
from patient to patient. Analysis of IgG subtypes by
Soundararajan et al. [15] demonstrated that while most
patients have functional IgG1 and or IgG3 antibodies, some
have IgG4, which we know does not fix complement.
Calcineurin inhibitors such as ciclosporin have previously
been shown to inhibit histamine release from basophils and
mast cells when stimulated with anti-[gE antibodies and
pimecrolimus (ascomycin) seemed to be more potent than
ciclosporin [14]. They also have inhibitory effects on other
important components of the inflammatory/immune response, most notably T lymphocytes [16], and also eosinophils [17]. Basophils are dependent on T cell derived IL-3 for
priming, although IL-3 levels of sera and supernatants tested
were not determined. The randomized controlled trial of
ciclosporin in urticaria by Grattan et al. [10] demonstrated
that its in vivo efficacy might be because of inhibition of
antibody production, rather than inhibition of basophil or
cutaneous mast cell secretion. For example, the autologous
serum test to stored serum was not reduced in responsive
patients. Nevertheless, some patients respond to ciclosporin
within 4-5 days, a time interval suggesting an effect on
inflammation apart from antibody production. Although this
might be because of effects on cells other than basophils or
mast cells, our observations suggest that effects on these cells
should be reconsidered. We demonstrate significant in vitro
inhibition of the histamine releasing ability of the antireceptor
antibody but no effect upon the complement augmentation.
We have not tested ciclosporin inhibition of cutaneous mast

cells; however, basophils do infiltrate the skin of patients with
chronic urticaria [18] and may contribute to the inflammatory
response. Since calcineurin inhibitors such as ciclosporin and
ascomycin inhibit histamine release from IgE receptor crosslinking but not CSa receptor stimulation, failure of these
drugs to satisfactorily treat chronic autoimmune urticaria
may relate to this, at least in part.

Ascomycin or pimecrolimus is currently available in topical
form as Elidel’ cream (Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East
Hanover, NJ, USA) and reports of phase I/II trials for oral
pimecrolimus in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis have shown
that it is a safe and effective alternative to ciclosporin in these
dermatoses and may have fewer side-effects [19-21]. Since it
inhibits basophil histamine release at a concentration that is
comparable with ciclosporin, we believe that oral pimecrolimus may potentially be an effective treatment for autoimmune urticaria.
