Abstract

Background: Chronic urticaria is a common distressing allergic skin disorder. Immune dysregulation, histamine release
and mast cell degranulation are suggested as its underlying mechanisms.

Objective: Add-on therapy of vitamin D was evaluated in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria to determine the
quality of life and urticaria severity score.

Methods: In a prospective, double-blinded study, 80 participants with chronic spontaneous urticaria were randomized
to low (4200 IU/week, group 1) and high (28,000 IU/week, group 2) vitamin D3 supplementation groups for 12 weeks.
Demographic data; quality of life, urticaria severity and medication scores; 25-hydroxyvitamin D and anti-thyroid
peroxidase antibody levels; and autologous serum skin test data were collected.

Results: Both groups showed significantly reduced total urticaria severity score; decrement in group 2 score was significant compared to group 1 at week 6 (P = 0.010). Quality of life score was also significantly reduced; decrement in
group 2 score was significant compared to group 1 at both weeks 6 (P = 0.005) and 12 (P = 0.007). 25-hydroxyvitamin
D levels were elevated significantly over the course of 12 weeks in both groups; however, the elevation in group 2 was
significantly higher than group 1 at week 12 (P = 0.002). Medication score was significantly reduced, with no significant
difference between groups. No association was observed between positive autologous serum skin test, angioedema and
high level of Anti thyroperoxidase antibody with positive response to vitamin D.

Conclusion: Add-on therapy with vitamin D (28,000 IU/week) can be considered as a safe and potentially beneficial
treatment in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria.

urticarial wheals in 50% of the patients; 10% of the patients
experience angioedema alone and wheal and angioedema
coexist in 40% of the patients.* Two types of CU are defined:
chronic inducible urticaria and chronic spontaneous urticaria. The latter is defined as spontaneous presentation of wheal
and/or angioedema without any specific trigger.”

The pathogenesis of CU has not been exactly defined. Increasing evidence suggest the role of auto immunity in CU
pathogenesis.‘ Autologous serum skin test (ASST) is applied
as a simple and inexpensive in vivo screening test that determine histamine releasing factors in serum, including histamine releasing auto antibodies in CU.** IgG thyroid auto antibodies (anti thyroid peroxidase (anti TPO) antibodies) were
observed in 30% of CU cases, while the incidence of thyroid
auto antibodies in the general population is 5-10%. The activation of ‘autoallergic’ mast cells through anti TPO was reported
recently, while functional IgG antibodies against IgE or FceR1
were also observed.®”

Based on EAACI/GA?LEN/EDF/WAO Guideline for urticarial management, second generation H1 antihistamines are
the first line pharmacological therapy of CU and up dosing is
recommended in case that clinical presentations persist. Omalizumab and cyclosporine are recommended as 3“ and 4" line
treatment.* Addition of Montelukast and H2 antihistamines are
also suggested.”"”

There are promising clinical observations that reported the
association of vitamin D with allergic diseases.'"'? Some studies were designed to find out the role of vitamin D in atopic
dermatitis (AD),'*”” allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) and CU’
due to immune dysregulation mechanisms, involved in these
diseases. Correlation between vitamin D deficiency with AD
and ACD severity, was observed in previous reports.”

Some studies revealed the role of vitamin D in CD141*
cells’ activation that is engaged in T-reg activation and inflammation inhibition through IL10 release. These mechanisms
might help to understand immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D,'* as an add-on therapy for CU treatment, due to its
immunomodulatory effects.’? In previous studies, the lower
levels of vitamin D were reported in CU patients.'”°7! Vitamin D add-on therapy resulted in reduced severity of clinical
symptoms” and improved quality of life.*’* However, studies are few and there is inadequate evidence to support the
administration of vitamin D supplementation in CU patients.’”

The present study was designed to assess the effect of low
(4200 IU) and high dose (28000 IU) of vitamin D add-on therapy, applied once a week, on the clinical symptoms and quality of life of CU patients in Shiraz (southwest of Iran). The
results were evaluated based on urticaria severity score (USS)
and chronic urticaria quality of life (CU-Q,oL) questionnaires,
considering the presence of angioedema, anti TPO antibody
and ASST test positivity.

 

Methods
Study design

This is a randomized double blind clinical trial study, conducted 2016-18 in a tertiary referral center (Emam Reza Allergy Clinic affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences).
Approved by local Ethics Committee of Shiraz University of

Medical Sciences, this study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier (NCT number: NCT02873364).

Sample size was determined using medCalc software and
randomization was conducted with permuted block randomization method, with block size of four.

Inclusion criteria

Patients (2 12 years old) who fulfilled the CU criteria, diagnosed by allergy and immunology specialists were recruited:
patients with the history of CU and/or angioedema, presented
most of the week days, that had continued longer than 6 weeks,
were included. Written Informed consent was obtained from
each participant.

Exclusion criteria

Patients with one or more of the following criteria were excluded:

Chronic inducible urticaria, hereditary/acquired angioedema, urticarial vasculitis, sarcoidosis, primary hyper paratyroidism, anaphylaxis, auto inflammatory syndromes, hyper calcemia (serum Ca level > 10.3 mg/dL and spot urine Ca level > 30
mg/dL), 25(OH)D = 200 ng/mL, renal failure (GFR < 50 mL/
min/1.73 m”), renal lithiasis, malignancy, pregnancy, lactation
and granulomatous disease.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and alcohol, as CU triggers, were prohibited throughout the study.

Intervention

Total of 80 patients were divided into two equal groups.
Group 1 received low dose (4200 IU/week) and group 2 received higher doses (28000 IU/week) of vitamin D (as vitamin D, pearls), weekly, for 12 weeks. Trial profile is shown in
Figure 1. Doses of vitamin D were selected based on the minimum and maximum safe dose for patients aged = 12 years.”°

Baseline medication and medication score

Based on previous studies and guide lines,®* the baseline
treatment protocol was designed as follows: 1) cetirizine: 10
mg/day up to 40 mg/day. 2) Montelukast: 5 mg/day (12-14 year

old patients) and 10 mg/day (patients > 14 years old). 3) Ranitidine: 4-5 mg/kg/day (12-14 year old patients) and 300 mg/
day (patients > 14 years old). The dose of cetirizine was adjusted based on the USS. Short course of prednisolone therapy
(maximum four days) was applied as rescue therapy. Patients
received allergy medications for at least one month and medication score was calculated at this primary endpoint. Then
vitamin D was added to the medication regimen and medication score was noted at weeks 6 and 12.

To calculate the medication score, points 2 and 8 were assigned for regular dose and 4 fold doses of antihistamines.
Point 2, 6 and 8 were assigned for montelukast, hydroxychloroquine and cyclosporine (3 mg/Kg), respectively. Points 5, 10
and 15 were assigned for < 11 mg, 11-25 mg and > 25 mg of
prednisolone, respectively.

Data collection

Demographic data and medical history were collected in
the prepared data sheets. Baseline characteristics such as: age,
gender, body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, educational level, duration of hives, vitamin D level at enrollment, atopy,
angioedema, ASST, vitamin D supplementation prior to the
study, smoking, alcohol consumption, NSAID exacerbation,
thyroid diseases, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), and anti TPO
positive test were recorded.

Questionnaires

‘The effectiveness of the treatment was evaluated based on
the translated USS questionnaire” and clinical symptoms were
scored from 0 to 93. This questionnaire was applied since it
is validated in Persian language. Higher USS scores indicate
more severity of the disease. QoL was also assessed based on
the translated and validated CU-QvoL questionnaire.* Higher
QoL scores indicate lower quality of life. Questionnaires were
filled at baseline, weeks 6 and 12.

Lab data

Blood samples were collected to assess serum levels of: albumin, Ca, P, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti TPO, free thyroxin and renal function, at patient enrollment. Serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin
D (25(OH)D) was recorded to assess vitamin D level at three
time points: at baseline, weeks 6 and 12. 25(OH)D level < 20
ng/mL, 20-30 ng/mL and = 30 ng/mL were considered as deficient, insufficient and sufficient, respectively.”

Spot urine was analyzed to determine urine Ca level in three
time points: at enrollment, weeks 6 and 12.

4200 IU/week (N = 35)

 

ASST test

ASST test was conducted as reported by Sabroe et al.”
Intradermal injection of normal saline and prick test of histamine (10 mg/mL) were considered as negative and positive
controls. Following the intradermal injection of fresh autologous serum (0.05 mL), the red wheal diameter = 15 mm (compared to negative control) was considered as positive.

Statistical analyzes

SPSS software was used to analyze data. Repeated measure
ANOVA (RMANOVA) was applied to compare the difference
in variables over time and between groups (P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant). Since RMANOVA results
showed minor differences, comparison between groups was
performed in detail with student t-test, considering adjusted a
(a = 0.017). To observe the differences within one group over
the time, RMANOVA and Friedman’s test were used for
parametric (QoL and USS scores) and non-parametric data
(25(OH) level and medication score). To compare two paired
groups (comparison of time points within one group), paired
sample t-test and Wilcoxon signed rank analyzes were applied
for parametric and non-parametric data. Baseline parameters
were compared between groups with independent t-test and
Mann-Whitney U-test, for parametric and non-parametric
data; and P < 0.05 was considered as significant. Based on the
analysis of questionnaires and the difference of vitamin D level between the groups that received high (28000 IU/week) and
low dose (4200 IU/week) of vitamin D, the results of high dose
group (group 2) was compared with low dose group (group 1),
as the control group.

Results

In this study, 80 patients were recruited based on the aforementioned criteria and 69 patients were followed. In group 1,
five patients did not comply with their medication order or
follow-up. In group 2, five patients were excluded due to personal reasons and one patient due to renal lithiasis. Hence, in
group 1, 35 patients (6 male and 29 female) with the mean age
of 40.02 (17-75) years old and in group 2, 34 patients (5 male
and 29 female) (Figure 1) with the mean age of 39.94 (18-76)
years old were studied. The mean course of the disease was
6.62 and 4.24 years for groups 1 and 2.

There was no significant difference in terms of the base
line characteristics (age, gender, BMI, ethnicity, duration of
hives, vitamin D level at baseline, atopy, angioedema, ASST) in
groups 1 and 2, except for the number of patients with thyroid
dysfunction, which was higher in group 2 (P = 0.040) (Table 1).

Questionnaires

At the beginning of the study, mean CU-Q.oL total scores
were not statistically different between groups 1 and 2 (Figure
2A). At the end of the study, total CU-QvoL scores were significantly reduced in each group (P < 0.0001): 30.64% and 42.99%
reduction in groups 1 and 2. In both groups, the observed decrement in CU-Q,oL score was significant at weeks 6 and 12,
compared to baseline (P < 0.0001). The decrement at week 12
was also significant compared to week 6 in low dose (P = 0.006)
and high dose groups (P = 0.016). Comparing low and high
dose groups, a significant reduction in mean CU-Q,oL score
was observed in high dose group at weeks 6 (P = 0.005) and 12
(P = 0.007), compared to low dose group.

As shown in Figure 2B, at the beginning of the study, the
mean USS total scores were not statistically different between
group | and 2. At the end of the study, USS means total score
was significantly reduced in each group (P < 0.0001): 50.05%
and 67.58% reduction in group 1 and 2. Significant difference
was observed between baseline with weeks 6 and 12 in both

groups (P < 0.0001). The difference of week 6 and 12 was significant in group 1 (P < 0.0001); however, this difference was
not significant in group 2. Comparing two groups of the study,
the mean USS score was significantly decreased in group 2
at week 6 (P = 0.010); however, no significant difference was
observed at week 12 between groups 1 and 2.

Medication score for CU

At the baseline, the medication score was not statistically
different in groups 1 and 2. The medication score was significantly reduced to 3.37 and 5.17 in groups 1 and 2 (P < 0.0001)
throughout the study. In both groups the decrement in medication score was statistically significant at both weeks 6 and
12, compared to baseline (P < 0.0001); and at week 12, compared to week 6, as well (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.004 for groups 1
and 2). However, no significant difference in medication score
was observed between groups 1 and 2. Data are presented in
Figure 2C.

D level (2D) is presented at baseline, week 6 and week 12. The significant differences are assigned by *. Quality of life score was
significantly reduced over the course of study and decrement in group 2 score was significant compared to group 1 at both weeks
6 (P = 0.005) and 12 (P = 0.007). Both groups showed significantly reduced total urticaria severity score and decrement in group 2
score was significant compared to group 1 at week 6 (P = 0.010). Medication score was significantly reduced over the course of
study, with no significant difference between groups. 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were elevated significantly over the course of 12

weeks in both groups; the elevation in group 2 was significantly higher than group 1 at week 12 (P = 0.002)

Lab data
25(OH)D levels

Deficiency in 25(OH)D level was observed in 65.21% of
the patients (< 20 ng/L). Although at the baseline, the mean
level of vitamin D was higher in group 1, the difference with
group 2 was not statistically significant. In both groups, the
increment in 25(OH)D level was significant at weeks 6 (P =
0.002 and P < 0.0001 for groups 1 and 2) and 12 (P < 0.0001),
compared to baseline; also, the observed increment at week 6
was statistically significant compared to week 12 (P < 0.0001).
The mean level of vitamin D had significantly increased in
each group (P < 0.0001); however, the increment was significantly higher in group 2 at week 12 (P = 0.002) (Figure 2D).

Anti TPO level
High TPO levels were observed in 23.18% of the patients.
Comparing the USS and CU-Q.oL total scores in groups with

normal and high levels of anti TPO (> 34 IU/mL), no significant
difference was recorded at the baseline and also weeks 6 and 12
between groups (Table $1).

ASST test

Intradermal ASST test was positive in 37.68% of the patients. Comparing the USS and CU-Q.oL total scores in groups
with positive and negative ASST test, no significant difference
was observed at the baseline and also at weeks 6 and 12 between
groups (Table $2).

Angioedema

The history of angioedema was recorded in 68.11% of the
patients. The total CU-Q,oL and USS scores were compared between groups with and without angioedema. Although at the
baseline, the total CU-Q.oL and USS scores were significantly higher in patients with angioedema, (P = 0.002, P = 0.003);

no significant difference was observed in USS and QoL score
between groups with or without angioedema at weeks 6 and 12
(Table $3).

Discussion

It was reported that chronic urticaria results in considerable socioeconomic burden.* The mainstay of CU therapy is
symptom relief and not disease modifying. Recent researches
on urticaria have focused on the underlying immune mechanisms, the involved mediators and mast cell activation pathways; proposing the auto immunity pathways in urticaria
pathogenesis.» Evaluation of vitamin D, with immunomodulatory effects, was considered in CU patients in the present work.
In the present study, in line with a meta-analysis by
Tuchinda et al.,* vitamin D deficiency was significant in CU
patients. Based on Table 1, 86.95% of the patients were observed with vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency. Based on the
results, it was observed that vitamin D supplementation in CU
patients resulted in the reduction of clinical symptoms (USS
scores), reduction of medication score, and improvement in
QoL (reduction of CU-Q.oL score). Although these effects
were observed in both groups, group 2 patients who received
igher dose of vitamin D (28000 IU/week) were significantly
improved compared to group 1 (Figure 2A-C). CU-Q.oL score
was significantly different between the two groups in weeks
6 and 12; however, the significant difference in USS was only
observed in week 6. This might be due to the differences in
USS and CU-Q.oL questionnaires criteria. Reduced doses of allergy medications were also recorded; however, no significant
differences were observed between groups.

The involvement of autoimmunity mechanisms in CU
pathogenesis and the association of CU with positive ASST
test® and high levels of anti TPO antibody were reported in
previous studies. However, in the present work, positive ASST
test and the existence of anti TPO antibodies were not associated with the severity of the disease. In addition, no significant
difference was observed in vitamin D effectiveness.

In the present observation, the frequency of angioedema
was higher than previous studies at baseline (68.11% (Table $3)
vs. 40%).! Although patients with angioedema presented with
higher USS and CU-Q,oL scores at the baseline, no significant
difference was observed in vitamin D effectiveness.

In the study by Tuchinda et al.,* adjunctive therapy with
higher doses of vitamin D, for 4-12 weeks (at least 28000 IU/
week) for patients with vitamin D deficiency was suggested.
The recommended dose for vitamin D, is 140000 IU/week (for
6 weeks). The results of the present randomized clinical study
were in accordance with other studies, which reported the effects of vitamin D on the reduction of CU symptoms. In the
study by Goetz et al.,** 63 patients with idiopathic skin disorders (rash, urticarial, angioedema) were followed, of which
90% had low levels of vitamin D (< 32 ng/mL). Following the
application of 50000 IU vitamin D/week over 8-12 weeks, the
symptoms were reduced in 70% of the patients. In the study
by Boonpiyathad et al.” (20000 IU/day of vitamin D,, 6 weeks)
and Oguz Topal et al.,* (300000 IU/month of vitamin D, for
3 months) the urticarial activity score (UAS) and dermatology
life quality index (DLQI) were reduced significantly following
vitamin D supplementation.

 

 

This study was compared with the study by Rorie et al. in
which the effect of vitamin D (600 IU/day and 4000 IU/day)
for CU patients was determined.”* The severity of clinical
symptoms was reduced and QoL has improved; however, no
significant change was observed in the required dose of allergy medications. In the group receiving low dose of vitamin D
(600 IU/day), the recorded level of vitamin D was not elevated
significantly at the end of the study, compared to its baseline
level. On the contrary, in our study the vitamin D level had
increased, using low dose of vitamin D (4000 IU/week). This
might be due to the difference in the baseline level of vitamin
D, which was lower in both groups of the present study. Due
to the nonlinear kinetic of vitamin D elevation, the elevation
slope in the patients with lower level of vitamin D would be
higher.** Another difference is higher mean BMI in the study
by Rorie et al.” (Table 1). Patients with higher BMI require
higher dosage of vitamin D.”

There are confounding variables in vitamin D level such
as ethnicity, geographical region and cultural beliefs which affect sunlight exposure and the amount of produced vitamin D.
Difference of melanin pigmentations is another factor. This
study was conducted in south Iran with specific cultural and
geographical background.

There are some limitations to this study. The number of
subjects was limited and it was not a placebo-controlled study.
To find out whether vitamin D add-on therapy is efficient to
improve CU symptoms, further placebo-controlled studies with
larger sample size in various cultural and geographical conditions are warranted.

 

Conclusion

Based on this study, it might be concluded that using high
dose of vitamin D (28000 IU/week) as add-on therapy results
in the reduction of CU symptoms severity and the required
doses of allergy medications.
