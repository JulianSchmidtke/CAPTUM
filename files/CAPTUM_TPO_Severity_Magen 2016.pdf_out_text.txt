ABSTRACT

Background: The natural history of the progression from acute spontaneous urticaria (ASU) to chronic spontaneous
urticaria (CSU), CSU remains poorly understood.

Objective: To identify clinical and laboratory patient attributes that may be predictive of ASU progression to CSU.

Methods: We prospectively studied consecutive adult patients (age = 18 years) with a diagnosis of urticaria of <6 weeks’
duration. Healthy age- and sex-matched subjects served as controls. At study entry, autologous serum skin test (ASST),
complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, thyroid function tests, antinuclear antibodies, antithyroglobulin and
antiperoxidase antibodies, and immunoglobulin E level were assessed in all the subjects. ASST and urticaria activity score
assessment were performed in all the patients at baseline and then at weeks 7, 12, 24, and 48.

Results: Of 114 patients with acute urticaria and without identifiable causes, 73 patients (64%) were included in the ASU group,
41 patients in the CSU group (36%), and 44 healthy subjects in the control group. At baseline, 26 patients in the CSU group (63.4%)
had a positive ASST result, whereas only 17 patients with a positive ASST result (23.3%) were revealed in the ASU group (p <
0.001). Patients with baseline ASST positive results were characterized by more profound basopenia (mean [standard deviation],
0.05 + 0.08 cell/mm?) and more anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (18 [41.8%]) than those with the negative baseline ASST result
(mean [standard deviation], 0.13 + 0.09 cell/mm?>, p < 0.001 more profound basopenia; and 13 (18.1%), p = 0.009 more thyroid
peroxidase antibodies). We observed the disappearance of ASST positive result in some patients with CSU with baseline positive
ASST results, whereas, in some subjects with CSU, baseline negative ASST results came to be positive results throughout the study
period. A baseline positive ASST result of patients with ASU was a significant determinant (odds ratio 5.91 [95% confidence interval,
2.57-13.62]; p < 0.001) for a CSU diagnosis at week 7.

Conclusion: The patients with ASU who progressed toward CSU were characterized by a positive ASST result, thyroid
autoimmunity, and profound basopenia at baseline.

A“ urticaria (AU) is differentiated from chronic
urticaria based on the duration of illness, and it
is estimated that any type of urticaria will affect 2025% of the population at some point.’ Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) involves hives that last for >6
weeks and up to 1-5 years.” It is accepted that CSU has
no discernable external cause.* Chronic autoimmune
urticaria (CAU) is implicated as a principal cause of
CSU and potentially explains 30-50% of previously
idiopathic cases.‘ In CAU, the participation of different
pathogenic autoantibodies causes release of histamine
after reaction with immunoglobulin E (IgE) epitopes or
with the a chain of FceRI receptors.”° These autoim

mune mechanisms could be detected in patients with
CAU by the autologous serum skin test (ASST) and by
immunoassay.’ A positive ASST result correlates
with disease exacerbation in patients with CAU.’°

Usually, CSU initially presents as AU. Although several infections, drugs, and foods are the most common
triggers of AU, >50% of AU cases remain idiopathic.'1
These AU cases with unknown origin could be considered acute spontaneous urticaria (ASU). As many as
~25% of cases of ASU in infancy and early childhood
may eventually be diagnosed as CSU."* Nevertheless, the
natural history of the progression from ASU to CSU in
the adult population remains poorly understood. The
purpose of this study was to identify clinical and laboratory patient attributes that might be predictive of ASU
progression to CSU.

METHODS

Patients and Setting

We prospectively studied consecutive adult patients
(ages = 18 years) who were referred to our outpatient
allergy clinic from Ashdod region (Ashdod, Israel) for

a period of 14 months due to a diagnosis of urticaria
with <6 weeks’ duration. All the subjects who were
taking antihistamine (AH) medications at referral discontinued taking the AH at least 4 days before skin testing.
The participants had no clinical signs of infection and no
clinical signs of food allergy. All the patients with physical and cholinergic urticaria; subjects treated with any
medication (except AH); and those with thyroid diseases,
systemic lupus erythematosus, and malignancy were excluded. Pregnant or breast-feeding patients were also
excluded. To exclude physical types of urticaria, the
following tests were performed: test for dermographism, cold provocation and threshold test by using an
ice cube, heat provocation, a threshold test by using
warm water, and a pressure test by using pressure of
0.2-1.5 kg/cm? for 10 and 20 minutes. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board
of Barzilai Medical Center, Israel, and all the subjects
gave informed consent.

Clinical Evaluation of Urticaria

At study entry, all the patients underwent a physical
examination, liver and renal function tests, complete
blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate evaluation, stool analysis for parasite ova, thyroid function
tests, antinuclear antibodies, antithyroglobulin and/or
antiperoxidase antibodies, and IgE titer. Assessment of
urticaria activity was performed according to a joint
initiative of the Dermatology Section of the European
Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology, the
EU-Funded Network of Excellence, the Global Allergy
and Asthma European Network, the European Dermatology Forum, and the World Allergy Organization
guidelines.’ The urticaria activity score (UAS), which
is based on the assessment of key urticaria symptoms
(wheals and pruritus), was graded from 0 (none) to 3
(severe). This score was used to assess the clinical
severity of ASU. The CSU activity was measured by
advising patients to document 24-hour self-evaluation
scores for 7 days. The mean of the UAS over 7 consecutive days was used.

Fexofenadine hydrochloride, 180 mg once a day
(manufacturer’s recommended or licensed dose; Telfast; Sanofi-Aventis, Netanya, Israel), was used as the
drug of choice in the treatment of all the patients with
ASU and CSU. The patients were reexamined every 7
days for 6 weeks to assess AH efficacy. Remission was
defined as the absence of urticaria symptoms for at
least 4 weeks without any medication.

ASST

ASST was performed at baseline and then at weeks 7,
12, 24, and 48. ASST was performed with 50 wL of the
patient’s undiluted serum. Serum was collected by allowing the blood to clot at room temperature for 30

Allergy and_Asthma Proceedings

minutes and centrifugation at 500 Xx g for 10 minutes.
This serum was then injected intradermally into the
volar aspect of the forearm, along with simultaneously
injected controls, including 50 wL of sterile normal
saline solution and freshly prepared histamine (50 wL
of 10 ug/mL of histamine solution; Histatrol; ALK
Abello, Inc., Hersholm, Denmark). Readings of the
autologous serum-induced wheal were taken at 30
minutes as well as the histamine-induced wheal at 10
minutes. The area of wheal was outlined with a thintipped marker pen and traced onto an acetate sheet to
make a permanent record, which was subsequently
used for analysis of areas of the wheal. The mean of the
maximum perpendicular diameters of the wheal reactions was used to assess the ASST, the histamine, and
normal saline solution control skin tests. The ASST
result was considered to be positive if the autologous
serum-injected site manifested a wheal with a diameter
of =1.5 mm that of the saline solution site reaction.'®

Statistical Analysis

Continuous variables are expressed as a mean (standard deviation). One-way analysis of variance and
Bonferroni post hoc examinations were carried out for
comparisons among the three groups (ASU, CSU, and
control). Categorical variables of ASU and CSU groups
were compared by using the Pearson x’ test. The
Mann-Whitney U and Fisher’s exact tests were applied
for continuous and categorical variables to compare
patients with ASST positive and negative results, respectively. Logistic regression was used to examine the
effects of demographic, clinical, and laboratory factors
on progression of ASU to CSU. For all values, the level
of significance of p < 0.05 and with Bonferroni adjustment of p < 0.025 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS for
Windows version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

RESULTS

During the study period, 114 consecutive patients
with idiopathic AU were referred to our allergy clinic.
Of these, 73 patients (64%) had urticaria that resolved
during =6 weeks and were included in the ASU group.
The remaining 41 patients (36%) had recurrent wheals
and pruritus for >6 weeks. They were included in the
CSU group. Healthy age- and sex-matched subjects
(n = 44) served as the control group. At baseline, 26
patients in the CSU group (63.4%) had a positive ASST
result, whereas only 17 (23.3%) (p < 0.001) had a positive ASST result in the ASU group. There were no
other differences in demographics and clinical characteristics among the study groups at baseline (Table 1).

Because a ASST positive result was the main discriminant between ASU and CSU at baseline, we further
performed comparisons of clinical characteristics of all

he patients according to the baseline ASST positive
results. Of the 114 patients, baseline ASST results were
positive in 43 (37.7%). The patients with baseline ASST
positive results were characterized by more profound
basopenia (mean [standard deviation], 0.05 + 0.08 cell/
mm?) and more anti-TPO antibodies (18 [41.8%]) than
hose with the negative baseline ASST (mean [standard

clinical and laboratory characteristics among the paients according to the baseline ASST positive results
(Table 2).

Similar improvements in the mean UAS over 7 consecutive days were observed throughout the study
period (at weeks 7, 12, 24, and 48) in patients with CSU
with both a positive and a negative baseline ASST
result (Table 3). Interestingly, we noted the disappearance of positive ASST results in some patients with
CSU and with baseline positive ASST results, whereas,
in some subjects with CSU, the baseline negative ASST
result became positive during the study. At week 48,
there was no difference in ASST positive results between patients with CSU and with baseline positive
ASST results (12 [46.2%]) and baseline negative ASST
results (6 [40%]) (p = 0.747) (Table 3). After 48 weeks of

prospective observations, no statistically significant
differences in CSU duration between the patients with
positive and negative ASST results were observed (Table 3). Multivariate analysis after the adjustment for
age, sex, and baseline UAS demonstrated that a baseline positive ASST result of patients with AU was a
significant determinant (odds ratio 5.91 [95% confidence interval, 2.57-13.62]; p < 0.001) for a CSU diagnosis at week 7.

DISCUSSION

In this prospective observational study, we identified
clinical and laboratory attributes of patients that were
predictive of ASU progression to CSU. We also noted
factors related to the natural history of CSU over 48
weeks. The UAS was an important parameter for predicting the severity of CSU in previous studies.21718
Nevertheless, we found that baseline UAS had no impact on ASU progression toward CSU. The baseline
ASST positive result was the only clinical parameter
that discriminated ASU from CSU during the first 6
weeks (ASU) after the beginning of urticaria and angioedema attacks. During the first 6 weeks (ASU), patients with a positive baseline ASST result were further
characterized by more-severe basopenia and more anti-TPO antibodies.

CSU has frequently been associated with autoimmune disease.” *! Published studies reported frequencies of thyroid autoimmunity in patients with CSU that
ranged from 23 to 39%." Patients with coexisting thyroid autoimmunity and CSU have a more-severe and
prolonged course of urticaria than those without thyroid autoimmunity.” However, the frequency of thyroid autoimmunity in patients with ASU has not been
studied previously. Our study found no statistically

significant difference in the frequency of thyroid autoantibodies between patients with ASU and the healthy
controls. However, these autoantibodies were more
prevalent in patients with CSU. The antithyroid antibodies likely play a pathophysiologic role in CSU but
not in ASU.

Highly cytokinergic IgE antibodies with polyreactivity to TPO in sera were shown to induce mast cell
activation.** Some patients with CSU express IgE anti

bodies against TPO as a unique pathophysiologic
mechanism of CSU.”° In addition, the presence of human IgE antibodies that react to thyroglobulin is also
closely associated with the autoimmunity of CSU.” In
addition, patients with CSU and with a highly specific
IgE to TPO showed a favorable response to anti-IgE
therapy.?” Whether the above-mentioned mechanisms
of thyroid autoimmunity have some effects in ASU
progression toward CSU must be elucidated in further
clinical and experimental studies.

There are limited data on the prognostic role of ASST
in ASU and in predicting disease severity and the
duration of CSU. Results of our study indicated a
potential use of ASST to predict the ASU progression
toward CSU. Nevertheless, no significant differences
were noted in CSU duration and disease activity
among the subjects with both baseline positive and
negative ASST results over 48 weeks of prospective
observation. Interestingly, throughout the study, we
observed a reversion in the baseline positive ASST
result into a negative ASST result in some patients with
CSU. We noted positive ASST results in other subjects
with baseline negative ASST results. Moreover, a similar proportion of CSU remission was achieved, notwithstanding the baseline ASST positive result at 48
weeks. This finding may agree with previous studies,
which revealed no association between ASST positive results and a longer duration of disease activity
in patients with CSU.’ In general, a systematic review provides significant heterogeneous data on the
prognostic role of ASST reactivity in CSU despite the
fact that ASST conversion has not been assessed in
the previous studies.?®

Another important question that arose from our
study is whether a positive ASST result represents the
same type of autoreactivity and indicates the presence
of similar mast cell—activating autoantibodies in patients with ASU and patients with CSU. Generally, the
presence of functional autoantibodies must be confirmed by the basophil histamine release assay and
their specificity confirmed by the immunoassay.'°
Mast cells were found to be critically involved in serum-mediated vascular leakage in both ASU and CSU
through IgE- and IgG-independent mechanisms.”’ The
hypothesized biologic factors that activate mast cells in
ASU may also be related to blood coagulation and the
complement system.*”*"

Analysis of recent data indicated that coagulation
and/or fibrinolysis proteases in serum may act as natural C3 and C5 convertases to generate biologically
active anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a). These then link
both cascades via multiple direct interactions via a complex serine protease system.** We do not presently
know whether the plasma bradykinin-forming cascade
and the complement pathways are equally involved in
the pathophysiology of ASU and CSU.

CONCLUSION

Angioedema, atopy, higher total serum IgE and Creactive protein, and lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin
D levels have previously been identified as factors
associated with a longer CSU duration and severity.21752-36 Still, our study revealed no evidence to support the role of these parameters in predicting an advancement of ASU toward CSU. We note that the main
limitation of our study is that we did not compare
functional autoantibodies by basophil histamine release and/or immunoassays in patients with ASU and
in patients with CSU. Additional research is needed to
determine possible pathophysiologic mechanisms that
discriminate ASU from CSU.
