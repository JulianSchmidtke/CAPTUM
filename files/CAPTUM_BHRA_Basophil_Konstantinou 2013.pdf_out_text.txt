Abstract

An autoimmune subset of chronic spontaneous urticaria is increasingly being recognized internationally, based on laboratory and clinical evidence that has
accrued over the last 20 years. This evidence has been reviewed by a taskforce of
the Dermatology section of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical
Immunology. Functional autoantibodies in chronic urticaria (CU) patient sera
have been demonstrated against IgE and FceRIo by basophil and mast cell histamine release assays and by basophil activation assays. Antibody specificity has
been confirmed by immunoassay, but there is a poor correlation between functionality and immunoreactivity. Approximately 25% of CU patients have a positive basophil histamine release assay and show autoreactivity (a positive
autologous serum skin test), whereas 50% are negative regarding both. Functionality of CU sera appears to be complement dependent on mast cells but not
exclusively on basophils. Basophil activation by CU sera is predominantly
restricted to IgG! and IgG3 subclasses. Circumstantial evidence for CU being an
autoimmune disease comes from an observed association with other autoimmune
diseases, a strong association between serum functionality and HLA-DR4 haplotype and the good response of CU patients to immunotherapies. It was proposed
that a study should be undertaken to prospectively validate potentially relevant
clinical criteria (from the history, examination and routinely available clinical
investigations) against a new ‘gold standard’ for the diagnosis of ACU (positive
autoreactivity, functional bioassay and immunoassay) to define preliminary criteria sets for the diagnosis of ACU based on clinical and laboratory features with
highest individual sensitivity and specificity.

The current nomenclature of urticaria endorses the use of a
clinical rather than an aetiological classification to recognize
that some patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (syn.

rather than idiopathic aetiology (1).

An EAACTI taskforce panel was established in 2010 to
review the laboratory and clinical evidence for CU being
an autoimmune disease in a definable subset of patients
by examining whether there is sufficient direct, indirect and

circumstantial evidence currently available to fulfil Witebsky’s postulates (2). A systematic review of the English language medical literature up to December 2011 was performed
(for more details, see online repository). Critical evaluations
included the definition of autoimmunity according to existing
consensus reports and evaluation of common features of CU.
Consensus was reached on information provided by each
member of the panel at the meeting, followed by an in-depth
review of the published data by all authors in serial revisions
until the final document prior to submission.

Evidence for the existence of functional autoantibodies
in chronic spontaneous urticaria

IgG and/or IgM antibodies against IgE were first identified
by immunoassay in patients with CU, urticarial vasculitis
and cold urticaria by Gruber and co-workers in 1988 (3).
The serum of one patient with cold urticaria containing an
IgM anti-IgE was shown to release histamine from healthy
nonatopic donor basophils, but the possible relevance of this
finding was not elaborated. IgG histamine—releasing autoantibodies with properties of anti-[gE were described 3 years
later by Grattan et al. (4) in sera of CU patients. Most of
the same sera were also shown to be vasoactive in vivo by
eliciting a weal and flare response to autologous serum skin
test (ASST), raising the possibility for the first time that some
patients previously regarded as having idiopathic CU (CIU)
might have an autoimmune disease. These initial findings
were extended by the same group in 1993 (5), and importantly, novel functional autoantibodies with specificity
against the high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) were identified
by neutralization of the histamine-releasing activity of IgG
prepared from CU sera with the soluble alpha chain of
FceRI. These findings were confirmed by Fiebiger et al. (6)
2 years later and in other centres (7-11).

Data from these early studies suggested that almost 40%
of the patients previously characterized as having CIU had
circulating autoantibodies that might be implicated in urticaria pathogenesis (4, 5). Their functionality was defined by
the release of histamine from healthy donor basophils or
mast cells (MCs). An additional 5-10% have functional IgG
anti-IgE autoantibodies. The ratio of functional anti-FceRIa
to anti-IgE ranges from 3: 1 to 4: 1 (8, 12). The specificity
of these autoantibodies has been confirmed by either Western
blot (WB) (6, 8, 9, 12-15), ELISA (10, 16) or immunoenzymetric (17) assays. However, no clear correlation between
binding and functional assays has been found.

There is some evidence that other autoantibodies may be
also involved in CU. Anti-FceRII/CD23 autoantibodies have
been identified in CU sera that elicit MC degranulation indirectly, via major basic protein release from eosinophils,
resulting in noncytotoxic degranulation (18). Antiendothelial
cell autoantibodies were present in some CU sera although
their biological significance is unclear (19). IgE autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase were detected by ELISA in
CU sera in one study (20), but not in another (21). These
autoantibodies might, in theory, elicit MC degranulation by
binding soluble thyroid antigens or other cross-reacting

28

Konstantinou et al.

self-antigens. It is possible, if not likely, that other autoantibody systems exist that may be directly or indirectly relevant
to weal formation or persistence in CU patients.

A model of ‘conditional autoimmunity’ has been proposed
on the premise that natural anti-FceRIa autoantibodies can
be found in healthy subjects and may become pathogenic
locally following a dynamic shift between FceRI occupancy
by its natural ligand, IgE, and its unoccupied state. Removal
of IgE from basophils resulted in their activation and MC
mediator release by natural anti-FceRIx autoantibodies,
while resensitization with IgE prevented this autoantibodydependent histamine release (22, 23). This finding may
provide a model for cellular events in the skin that determine
whether MC receptor activation, degranulation and weal formation occur as a result of exposure to anti-FceRIo. autoantibodies or not. There is evidence that IgE receptor
occupancy is relevant in CU as most patients have antiFceRIa that will bind the «1 domain of the FceRI despite
IgE sensitization. However, in a minority, the autoantibody
competes with IgE for the receptor, binding to its «2 domain,
and will not trigger histamine release from basophils that are
already presensitized with IgE (24). Local heat or pressure
from clothing contact often appears to induce weals in
spontaneous urticaria and might, perhaps, promote the local
conditions necessary for changes in IgE receptor occupancy
resulting in MC degranulation.

Although most of the studies have been conducted in
adults, there is evidence that a similar percentage of children
with CU have the same ‘functional’ autoantibodies (25, 26).

Basophil and mast cell assays for functional
autoantibodies in CU

Histamine release assays

Both blood basophils (5, 6, 8-10, 14) and cutaneous MCs (7,
9) from healthy donors have been used in bioassays to evaluate CU sera containing anti-FceRI« or anti-IgE autoantibodies. Ex vivo activation of these cells currently provides the
gold standard for the characterization of CU sera as being
functional (i.e. having an effect on a target cell) or nonfunctional.

After pooling available data from published studies (5, 7,
12, 13, 25-56), among patients with CU, 32.5% (median,
95% CI: 12-39.1%) have a positive whole serum-induced
basophil histamine release assay (BHRA). Approximately
25% of CU patients [median: 26.5% (95% CI: 10.3-32.8%)]
have a positive ASST and a positive BHRA, 49.5% (median,
95% CI: 23.9-66.2%) have a negative ASST and a negative
BHRA, 15.8% (median, 95% CI: 1.6-64.1%) have a positive
ASST and a negative BHRA, and 4.1% (median, 95% Cl: 0
—11.5%) have a negative ASST and a positive BHRA.

Only a few studies relate anti-FceRIo or anti-I[gE autoantibodies in CU patients’ sera detected by immunoassay to
functional bioassay results (8, 9, 12-14). After pooling the
available data from these studies, anti-FceRIx autoantibodies
are found in 49.2% (range, 41.6-72%) of CU patients;
26.4% (range, 20-52%) have both autoantibodies and a

Konstantinou et al.

positive BHRA, while 16.5% (range, 0-22.7%) have a positive BHRA with undetectable levels of autoantibodies. The
study by Sabroe et al. (12) concluded that CU patients can
be classified into five subsets: 26% with histamine-releasing
anti-FceRIa antibodies (group 1), 15% with immunoreactive
nonfunctional anti-FceRIa antibodies (group 2), 9% with
MC-specific histamine-releasing factors, 9% with functional
anti-IgE antibodies and 41% with no identifiable factors
(group 5). Using a panel of basophils and MCs from healthy
donors increased the number of strongly positive ASST CU
sera evoking significant histamine release to 95% (43) from
the expected level of around 50% for all positive ASST CU
sera tested on single or paired basophil donors. Isolation,
culture and use of MCs is much more laborious, difficult to
perform and hard to standardize than the BHRA. On the
other hand, the human basophil secretory response to FceRIdependent stimuli varies widely. Basophils from 10% to 20%
of unselected healthy individuals are nonreleasers to FceRIdependent stimuli (57, 58). Consequently, the BHRA is
dependent on the individual characteristics of the healthy
donors from whom they originate. Unfortunately, there has
been no international standardization of this test to date
including a lack of agreement on the positive threshold for
the BHRA. Further research including the characterization
of more suitable assay populations such as human MC lines
(16, 59) is needed to standardize and improve this method.
There seems to be a reasonably good concordance between
basophil and MC histamine release in response to CU sera,
suggesting a common pathway of cell activation (7, 9).

Basophil activation marker expression

Basophil activation tests have also been used to identify functional serum factors in CU patients. The induced basophil
activation markers found to be most reliable for assessing
functional activity in CU sera are CD63 (34, 35, 46, 60-63)
and especially (64) CD203c (36, 62). Expression of CD63 has
been closely related to basophil degranulation (65), while
CD203c is upregulated after basophil activation independent
of degranulation (66).

CD203c expression on allogeneic basophils from a healthy
donor was found to correlate significantly with histamine
release from the same donor after stimulation with CU sera
(36). In the same study, IgG depletion of three CU sera
significantly reduced CD203c expression, suggesting an
IgG-mediated basophil activation mechanism.

Similarly, a CU serum positive for anti-FceRIo autoantibodies by WB induced significantly higher CD63 expression
on basophils from highly IgE-sensitized donors as opposed
to basophils from nonatopic donors, while this was not
observed in a CU patient without these autoantibodies (46).
Neither the presence of anti-FceRIo antibodies nor histamine-releasing activity of sera from CU patients was associated with consistent CD63 or CD203c expression on
basophils from a healthy donor, although these data were
based on a small sample size (62).

CD63 expression correlated linearly with healthy donor
basophil histamine release after activation with CU sera in

Defining and diagnosing autoimmune urticaria

two studies (35, 67), whereas in another study, it was found
that only 14 of 20 CU patients with positive ASST showed
activity in CD63 expression of a healthy donor (60). CD63
increase and degranulation are correlated after anti-IgE or
formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) _ stimulation
(62). Both Frezzolini et al. (34) and Gyimesi et al. (46) concluded that sera from ASST-positive CU patients are able to
significantly induce CD63 expression on basophils, providing
a sensitivity up to 95.5%.

Use of different methodologies appears to influence the
outcome. A tricolour flow cytometry method (based on identification of CD63, CD123 (interleukin-3 receptor) and
absence of HLA-DR-expression) may improve diagnostic
performance by avoiding IgE labelling as it is known that
FceRI expression may vary considerably between basophil
donors (34). Elimination of in vitro activation (e.g. with IL-3)
and use of washed leucocytes instead of whole blood may
also explain sensitivity and specificity discrepancies (46).

Influence of IgG subclass on histamine-releasing
activity of FesRI autoantibodies

The role of autoantibodies as a stimulus for MC degranulation is not straightforward as they may be nonfunctional as
well as functional (10, 14, 68). This functionality may be
attributable to the complement-fixing IgG, and IgG;
antibody subclasses as there is evidence suggesting that IgG
and IgG, (most commonly found in patients with other autoimmune cutaneous diseases) are less specific and more likely
to be nonfunctional than IgG; and IgG3, which are found
predominantly in CU (10). Anti-FceRIo autoantibodies have
been detected by immunoassay in other autoimmune diseases
(pemphigus vulgaris, dermatomyositis, systemic lupus erythematosus and bullous pemphigoid) (10), atopics (17) and even
healthy individuals (17, 49). This may explain the lack of a
significant correlation between the results of immunoassays
and those of histamine release studies in CU. It may also
account for the lack of correlation between the desensitization to anti-IgE-induced basophil histamine release observed
in CU basophils and the detection of FceRI-specific autoantibodies in CU (69).

 

The role of complement in mast cell and basophil
degranulation

Complement dependence has been shown for histamine
release from healthy donor cutaneous MCs in response to
IgG from CU patients (11). However, complement does not
appear to be obligatory for CU serum-induced basophil
release (4, 10, 68). The observation that CU serum histamine-releasing activity of basophils is thermostable at 56 °C
argues against complement involvement (5, 7, 38, 70, 71),
although reduction in heating-dependent histamine release
(il, 30) and complement-augmented histamine-releasing
activity of IgG from CU sera (72) have also been reported.
Under certain circumstances, monovalent rather than
bivalent cross-linking of these receptors by anti-FceRIa
autoantibodies may occur (11), resulting in immune complex

formation and complement activation via the classical pathway (14, 72) with generation of CSa (11), followed by MC
activation and histamine release (11, 14, 71) through binding
of the CSa receptor (72). It has been proposed that histamine
release due to C5a generation is primarily cutaneous rather
than systemic because CS5a receptors are expressed only by
skin MCs (73), a hypothesis that may explain why CU
patients do not commonly experience respiratory symptoms.

Evidence for intrinsic functional abnormalities of
basophils and mast cells in CU

Basophils from CU patients have been shown to exhibit
increased spontaneous basal histamine release ex vivo compared with basophils of normal individuals (4, 74). Incubation of basophils of CU patients with heterologous sera from
either healthy or CU patients resulted in enhanced histamine
release (4, 74). Analogous to basophils, cultured peripheral
blood MCs from CU patients have also been shown to exhibit increased basal histamine release compared with MCs
from normal individuals (75). In another study, histamine
release from skin MCs of CU patients stimulated by compound 48/80 in vivo using a skin chamber technique was
higher than in normal control subjects (76). Incubation of
basophils of patients with CU with heterologous sera from
CU patients resulted in increased histamine release (74).
Stored autologous sera taken during CU activity resulted in
positive ASST during CU remission, while the ASST was
negative if autologous serum was taken and tested during
remission (77).

However, in CU remission, direct (17, 78) or indirect (17)
FceRI-mediated histamine release with anti-IgE reportedly
increases in basophils, while cutaneous skin MC releasability
appears to decrease (76, 79), at least to a nonimmunological
stimulus like compound 48/80.

Evidence for basophils and mast cells as targets of
functional autoantibodies in lesional and uninvolved
skin of CU

Basophils

Several studies have shown peripheral blood basopenia in
patients with active CU (27, 80-82). Basophils are found in
biopsies from CU lesions, ASST-induced weals and unaffected skin from CU patients (83, 84). In addition, blood
basopenia is inversely related to the severity of urticaria (82).
The last two observations suggest that basopenia may be
attributed to basophil recruitment from the circulation into
weals or to the destruction of basophils by circulating
autoantibodies (27). CU patients with severe basopenia also
have the highest level of autoantibodies by immunoenzymetric assay (17).

Basophils from patients with active CU showed reduced
histamine release when stimulated with anti-IgE or antiFceeRI autoantibodies (81). This suppression of histamine
release is not evident with FceRI-independent stimuli, like
compound 48/80, fMLP, monocyte chemoattractant protein
30

Konstantinou et al.

1, bradykinin or calcium ionophore, pointing to an FceRI
pathway-specific defect (15, 74, 78, 81). A desensitization
process of the FceRI pathway via anti-FceRIx autoantibody
activity has been proposed as a potential explanation of this
observation (81). However, there was no clear relationship
between histamine releasability of basophils from CU
patients in response to anti-IgE stimulation and the presence
of autoantibodies in their sera, as detected by immunoassay,
suggesting that mechanisms other than FceRI-dependent
immunological desensitization may also be important (15,
17).

Mast cells

There is direct evidence from electron microscopy that MC
degranulation occurs with an overall reduction in stainable
MCs in positive ASST responses of CU patients (85). Similar
changes have been shown after skin tests with the experimental MC degranulating agent, compound 48/80 (86). In addition, local tachyphylaxis has been demonstrated by
reinjection of autologous serum at the same site (70). All
these observations suggest that MC mediators are likely to
be involved in the immediate weal and flare response to
autologous serum. The cutaneous response provides an in
vivo marker of serum-induced MC degranulation, which is
supported by in vitro functional studies (4), although other
influences, including hyper-responsiveness of MCs and the
microvasculature, are likely. In fact, this hyper-responsiveness
has been demonstrated with compound 48/80 and codeine
sulphate in active CU, while the absolute number of MCs
does not appear to increase (87). In CU remission, this
hyper-releasability resolves for compound 48/80, but not for
codeine (76, 79).

Association with other autoimmune diseases

Although there has been no systematic study of an association between CU and autoimmune diseases, there have
been reports of CU patients with vitiligo, pernicious anaemia
(88), rheumatoid arthritis (89), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis
(90), type 1 diabetes mellitus (91, 92), Grave’s disease (91,
93), coeliac disease (31, 94-96) and Raynaud’s phenomenon
with anticentromere autoantibodies (97). There have also
been many studies describing a high prevalence of IgG antithyroid antibodies ranging from 15% to 30%, and in particular Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, among patients with CU (50, 93,
98-104). Positive thyroid antibodies are more frequent in CU
patients with a positive BHRA than in those without (67,
105). Positive thyroid antibodies are also found more often
in ASST-positive CU patients than in ASST-negative CU
patients (42, 67, 101, 106, 107), although this was not the
case in all studies (31, 50, 53, 93). This increased incidence
appears to reflect the involvement of common genetic factors
in pathogenesis rather than shared epitope cross-specificity
between IgG antithyroid and anti-FceRIa antibodies (16).
Molecular mimicry of host structures by the saccharide
portion of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Helicobacter
pylori (HP) with the FceRI has been proposed (108). An

Allergy 68 (2013) 27-36 © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S
Konstantinou et al.

association has been described in ASST-positive CU patients
infected with HP and autoimmune thyroiditis (42).
This might explain anti-FceRIa autoantibody formation in
genetically predisposed individuals and provide an indirect
aetiological explanation of autoimmunity initiation in CU.

In addition, many CU patients reportedly have a nonorgan-specific increase in autoimmune markers such as rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies (32, 109).

The autoimmune basis of CU is further supported by the
observation that p21Ras expression is increased, whereas the
overall expression of the p21Ras stimulatory element hSOS1
(son of sevenless homolog 1) is downregulated in peripheral
blood mononuclear cells of patients with CU. This aberrant
signalling through the p21Ras pathway has been also
described in other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic
lupus erythematosus and type I diabetes mellitus. The
decreased hSOS1 expression was present only in ASST-positive patients (41).

CD40L expression was higher on in vitro activated CD3 T
lymphocytes from CU patients and the antiapoptosis marker
Bcl-2 was expressed higher in severe than in moderate CU.
This overexpression may be responsible for the polyclonal
hyper-reactivity of B cells to produce anti-FceRI antibodies,
in keeping with the concept of an autoimmune disorder. Evidence of T- and B-cell activation in CU emphasizes that CU
should be regarded as an immune disorder (110). Total IgE
was shown to be elevated in nonatopic CU patients as a possible marker of polyclonal B-cell activation (111).

 

Genetic predisposition

Immunogenetic studies have found a_ highly significant
association between certain HLA class II molecules that are
associated with autoimmune illnesses in general and CU in
particular (29, 112, 113). The prevalence of DRB1*04 (DR4)
and its genetically associated allele DQB1*0302 (DQ8) is
markedly increased in CU patients as a whole and ASSTpositive CU patients alone compared with the healthy population. In particular, HLA-DR4 is strongly associated with
increased BHRA activity and positive ASST responses (29,
112), while HLA-DR4 and DQB1*0301/4 frequencies were
significantly higher in ASST-positive CU patients than in
ASST-negative CU patients. CU patients are more commonly
HLA-Bw4 and HLA-DQ! positive (113).

There was a higher frequency of CU in first-degree relatives of patients with CU than expected, and most of them
had a positive ASST (114).

Response of CU to immunotherapies

Plasmapheresis (115) and intravenous immunoglobulin
(IVIG) infusions (116) appeared to benefit severe CU patients
with positive ASST and serum histamine-releasing activity in
uncontrolled studies. In one patient who responded to
plasmapheresis, the urticarial activity score mirrored the level
of functional autoantibodies, whereas the peripheral blood
basophil numbers showed an inverse relationship, thereby

providing good anecdotal evidence for a pathogenetic

relationship between these clinical and laboratory parameters.
Six weeks later, reaccumulation of the autoantibodies and
recurrence of basopenia coincided with clinical relapse (115).
However, the most studied immunosuppressive agent for CU
to date is ciclosporin A (CsA) (117-121) giving an average
dose- and duration-dependent response rate of 83.2% (range,
51.7-100%). It is the only drug with a strong evidence for
efficacy in CU. Patients with a positive serum BHRA
responded better to CsA than those with a negative BHRA
(117), while functional activity in serum was inhibited by
treatment (117). This action can be explained by inhibition of
either T-cell activation or T-cell-dependent antibody formation by B lymphocytes (122), while direct inhibition of basophil and MC histamine release has been also suggested as an
explanation for the partial and temporary clinical improvement seen in some patients (123). Other immunosuppressive
drugs used successfully in severe CU include mycophenolate
mofetil (124), methotrexate (125) and cyclophosphamide
(126, 127). It should not be forgotten that oral corticosteroids are the most widely used immunosuppressive and
anti-inflammatory drug for CU worldwide (128), although an
evidence base for their undoubted effectiveness is lacking.

Reports of patients with spontaneous and inducible CU
responding to treatment with anti-IgE (omalizumab) raise the
question as to how it might work in CU. Following an initial
rapid reduction in free IgE levels after treatment, there
appears to be a decrease in FceRI function (129) and probably FceRI numbers on basophils (130) and MCs (131). In
most cases, this results in a rapid clinical improvement
accompanied by reversal of laboratory abnormalities (i.e.
increased blood basophils and enhanced FceRI-dependent
basophil histamine release) (132) similar to that observed in
naturally recovered CU patients (17).

Autoimmune urticaria: is it a real entity?

According to the revisited Witebsky’s postulates (2) evidence
in support of an autoimmune origin of a human disease is
grouped in three categories: level 1: direct evidence from
transfer of pathogenic antibodies or T cells, level 2: indirect
evidence based on reproduction of the disease under question
in experimental animal models and level 3: circumstantial evidence from clinical practice.

Direct: The only direct in vivo proof of pathogenicity of
humoral factors in CU comes from a report of intradermal
injection of plasma from a CU patient with functional autoantibodies into a healthy volunteer producing a weal and
flare reaction similar to the patient’s ASST response, while
an ASST in the same healthy volunteer was negative (133).
However, cross-species passive transfer of human CU
patients with positive ASST responses to macaque monkeys
(134) and guinea pigs (135) was not demonstrated.

Another way to demonstrate the pathogenicity of an autoantibody is to demonstrate its action on the target organ or
cell ex vivo or in vitro. This is the case with the release of
histamine from healthy donor basophils (4) and MC (7) by
IgG purified from CU sera and inhibition assays using the
soluble FceRIa subunit (5). Positive BHRA activity data

31
Defining and diagnosing autoimmune urticaria

provide direct evidence of a stimulatory effect of anti
FeeRIa antibodies on the FceRI mimicking a receptor

agonist.

Indirect: Unfortunately, there are currently no experimental animal models of chronic urticaria. However, a mouse
model expressing human FceRI (136) may be suitable for
study. In another model, rats immunized with rat myeloma
IgE, produced anti-IgE, which induced immediate skin test
responses with the evidence of MC degranulation but only
on intradermal injection (137).

Circumstantial: There is a growing body of circumstantial
evidence for CU being an autoimmune disease, as detailed in
the previous sections.

Consensus from the existing evidence

The panel agreed that the evidence for autoimmune chronic
spontaneous urticaria (ACU) being a distinct disease entity
was persuasive although more evidence is required to meet
the full Witebsky’s criteria, particularly the need for an animal model. It should be noted that a number of human diseases are frequently designated autoimmune even though
they do not meet the previously described criteria (e.g. vitiligo, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary adrenal insufficiency,

Addison’s disease).

The main difficulties with identifying patients with ACU in
clinical practice are as follows:

e The lack of a characteristic clinical phenotype which
would allow patients with ACU to be distinguished confidently from those with other aetiological patterns of CU
(infection-related, pseudoallergic or idiopathic) on clinical
grounds for clinicians without access to functional bioassays.

e No single test is available that unequivocally demonstrates specific functional autoantibodies against FceRIa
or receptor-bound IgE on skin MCs or basophils. Functionality itself is considered to be the key criterion for
ACU definition. The panel considered whether the BHRA
or the ASST could be adopted as the ‘gold-standard’ tests
for functional autoantibodies to define ACU. Although
clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with
positive BHRA and ASST have been reported, nearly all
the publications relate to the use of whole sera rather
than purified IgG. The panel recognized that neither test
alone could be regarded as sufficiently robust to offer a
secure platform for the validation of diagnostic criteria
for ACU. The limitations of the individual tests used in

32

Konstantinou et al.

the assessment of ACU are summarized in Box El (see
online repository).

Recommendations from the panel

To overcome these limitations, the panel proposed that the
‘gold standard’ for ACU diagnosis should be a combination
of a positive bioassay, positive autoreactivity and a positive
immunoassay. The details and referenced methodologies are
summarized in Box 1.

Protocols and methodologies currently recommended as
best practice are presented in the online repository.

In addition, it was agreed that the taskforce should prospectively validate potentially relevant clinical and laboratory
criteria (from the history, examination and routinely available clinical investigations) to explore and identify potential
surrogate parameters that can substitute for the combined
major criteria of the newly adopted ‘gold standard’ (Box E2
in online repository) before reconvening to define preliminary
criteria sets for a diagnosis of ACU based on individual criteria with highest individual sensitivity and specificity.

 

 

Summary Box 1 proposed gold standard for diagnosis
of ACU

A A positive bioassay (BHRA or basophil activation marker
expression) to demonstrate functionality in vitro AND.

B Positive autoreactivity (by means of a positive ASST) to
demonstrate relevance in vivo to MC degranulation and
vasopermeability AND.

C A positive immunoassay for specific IgG autoantibodies
against FeeRI« and/or anti-IgE (WB or ELISA) to demonstrate antibody specificity.
