Editor,

We recently read with interest the article by Shalom et al. (1), which reported in multivariate
analysis, an association between chronic urticaria (CU) and metabolic syndrome (MS) in a
cross-sectional community-based study of 11261 patients with chronic urticaria (CU)
compared to control (odd ratio: 1.12 95% CI: 1.05-1.21, p=0.001). With this regard, we

would like to make several comments.

Recently another European Italian observational study reported a significant relationship
between obesity and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) compared to controls (odd ratio:
1.53 95% CI: 1.08-2.17), from a computer-based survey in 3489 patients with CSU (2). The
major bias of these cross-sectional studies, is the temporal relationship between the diagnoses
of metabolic syndrome (MS) and obesity, and CU. A recent review has reported preliminary
evidence from the limited data currently available which support the association between CU

and MS (3).

We report here a French national, non-interventional, multicenter study which included 278
patients with CU; CSU and CIU, recruited from out-patient consultations, by physician
members of the Urticaria Group of the French Society of Dermatology, over a period of 10
months (2015-2016) in 16 university hospitals. In this study, 202 (73%) were obese; 139
(50%) had an abdominal obesity, and 63 (23%) had both abdominal and general obesity
(obesity and abdominal obesity were respectively defined with Body Mass index: BMI =30
kg/m? and waist circumference >80 cm for females and 94 cm for males (4)). In the obese
group, the mean BMI and the mean waist circumference were respectively 28.6+5.8 and
99.5+12.9 cm compared to 21.7+2.7 and 76.4+9.6 cm in the non-obese group (Table 1).
Among the factors that can promote obesity, regular physic activity was documented in 37%

of the obese patients, which was significantly lower than physical activity reported in the

non-obese group (46%). Similarly, the use of antidepressant treatments was significantly
more frequent in the obese group compared to the non-obese-group (7.5% vs. 4 %,
respectively). Severity of CU (defined with Urticaria Control Test (UCT) <5/16 and/or the
Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) =11/30 (5)(6)) was similar in both obese and nonobese patients; UCT and DLQI scores were 7.844.8 and 8.4+6.99 respectively in the obese
group vs. 7.5+4.7 and 8.6+7.1 in the non-obese group. Using multivariate analysis, obesity
was not associated with severe CU after adjustment for confounders (in addition to obesity, a
model adjusted on age, sex, chronic used of corticosteroids and antihistamine treatment was
used) (OR=1.42 [95% CI: 0.81-2.52]). In terms of systemic steroids use for CU, short courses
of corticosteroids were more frequently found in the non-obese than the obese group (60.5%
vs. 44%, respectively) while continued corticosteroids were more frequent in the obese than
in the non-obese group (12% vs. 5%, respectively). Forty-seven percent and 46% of the
patients in the non-obese and obese groups respectively used at least 4 daily tablets of
antihistamines. Using multivariate analysis, chronic use of antihistamines (OR:0.99; 95%CI
0.97-1.03, p=0.92) or corticosteroids (OR:1.01; 95%CI 0.99-1.02, p=0.29) were not

associated with CU severity or with obesity.

The present data from a nationwide survey indicate that the characteristics of patients with
CU differ according to BMI; obesity, however, was not associated with severe CU in our
cohort after adjustment. Our study suffers the same limitations as all observational studies:
namely, no causality can be asserted between parameters that are correlated. Larger
prospective studies investigating the link between the metabolic syndrome and the severity of

CU seem important in order to achieve optimal management of patients.
