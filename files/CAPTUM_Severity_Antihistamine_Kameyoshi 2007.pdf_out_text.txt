Increasing the dose of cetirizine may lead to
better control of chronic idiopathic urticaria:
an open study of 21 patients

DOF: 10.111 1/}.1365-2133.2007.08060.x

Sir, Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is characterized by the
occurrence of spontaneous pruritic weals on most days. It is
common, but often disabling because of persistent clinical
symptoms which negatively influence the quality of life. Antihistamines have been the mainstay of treatment and they produce a good response in most patients, but not in all. For
those patients who derive only limited benefit from the initial
treatment, therapeutic guidelines advocate the use of antihistamines above the licensed or manufacturers’ recommended
doses.''"> However, there is scant evidence regarding the
effectiveness of dose increases of the same antihistamine in
the patients who responded poorly to the first dosage of the
agent.

Cetirizine is a second-generation antihistamine effective in
treating patients with CIU.* The manufacturer's recommended
dosage is 10 mg daily and it is permissible to increase the dose
up to 20 mg daily. As cetirizine inhibits histamine-induced
weal and flare reactions dose-dependently,* it is plausible that
higher doses of the drug will be more effective in controlling
urticarial symptoms. However, the clinical effect of such dose
increases has not been evaluated in patients with CIU. In some
previous studies, patients with CIU were initially treated with
cetirizine 5 mg, and they were allowed to increase the dose to
10 or 20 mg if no benefit was obtained at the starting dose.**
However, neither urticarial activity at each dose nor clinical
effects of the dose increase were assessed in these studies. In

the present open study, we evaluated the effect of increasing

patients with CIU, who had derived only limited benefit from
10 mg daily of the same drug.

Patients with CIU (> 1 month duration) were recruited
from secondary care hospitals. Patients with physical urticaria,
or urticaria caused by medications, foods or other known causes were excluded. Prior to the dose-increasing study, patients
were treated with cetirizine 10 mg daily for 1 or 2 weeks as a
screening period. Twenty-one patients who responded poorly
to the treatment, i.e. the change of the total daily score of
urticarial symptoms (see below) was less than 1, during the
screening period, were enrolled in the study. Approximately
one-third of patients who entered the screening period were
eligible. At the beginning of the study, patients were randomly assigned to group A (11 patients) or group B (10
patients), after obtaining informed consent, and all patients
were given an increased dose of cetirizine, 20 mg daily
(10 mg twice daily), for 1 or 2 weeks (period 1). Thereafter,
patients in group A continued the daily dosage of cetirizine
20 mg, whereas the patients in group B received the decreased
dosage of 10 mg, for an additional 1 to 2 weeks (period 2).
Patients were instructed to record daily urticarial activity
scores throughout the study period including the screening
period. The urticarial activity was assessed by using the scoring system as previously described.’ Namely, each of the
number of weals, the duration of the weals, and the severity
of itch, was scored from 0 to 3. The total daily score of the
urticarial symptoms, therefore, ranged from 0 to 9. For
the assessment of the clinical effect of increase/decrease
in the dosage, the data were analysed by the Friedman test
and the Steel—Dwass test.

There were no statistically significant differences between
the two groups in age (42°5 + 14:1 vs. 36:9 + 16:7 years,
mean + SD, for groups A and B, respectively) or mean urti
carial activity scores during the screening period [weal scores

1:56 + 0:64, duration scores 1:21 + 0:96 vs. 1:66 + 1:14 and
total scores 3°84 + 1:76 vs. 4:49 + 2:02 (Mann-Whitney
test)]. All patients had been unsatisfactorily treated with
H,-receptor antagonists, such as loratadine, fexofenadine, olopatadine or hydroxyzine, with or without corticosteroids. The
numbers of previously used drugs were also not significantly
different (2:90 + 1:37 vs. 3-09 + 1-92). These medications
were ceased before the screening period in each patient. Two
patients in group A had received montelukast 10 mg daily
before the study, and they received the same dose of the agent
throughout the study. As shown in Figure 1, urticarial activity
scores in period 1 were significantly lower than those in the
screening period in both groups, indicating the effect of dose
increases in controlling the symptoms. In group A, urticarial
activity scores improved further in period 2. On the other
hand, in group B, urticarial activity scores of weal, itch and
total in period 2 were higher than those in period 1 and weal
and itch scores in period 2 were not significantly different
from those in the screening period.

It is known that urticarial activity is usually higher during
the early stages in each patient and tends to remit with
time. It is thus possible that spontaneous resolution of the
disease may affect the study. However, the exacerbation
after the decrease of cetirizine observed in group B indicates
that the improvement observed in this study is due to dose
increment rather than spontaneous resolution. In addition,
our results indicate that the continuation of effective doses
of cetirizine may lead to further improvement as shown in
group A. Concerning adverse effects, two patients in group
B complained of drowsiness in period 1, but their complaints disappeared after the decrease of dosage of cetirizine
in period 2. Otherwise adverse effects were not observed
throughout the study period in all subjects. Although the
observation periods of 1-2 weeks could be short for evaluating this fluctuating disease and we could not deny the
possible involvement of placebo effect in this study, our
results indicate the clinical usefulness of a dose increase of
cetirizine.

In conclusion, our results support the clinical impressions®

that dose increases of antihistamines may lead to better control
of urticarial activity in patients who have not responded well
to initial doses of the same drug, and that the continuation of
the effective dose leads to further improvement of the disease
severity. For more robust evidence, a longer double-blinded
study is indicated and other H, antagonists should be studied
in a similar fashion.

Circumscribed palmar hypokeratosis: partial
remission by photodynamic therapy

DOE: 10.111 1/}.1365-2133.2007.08053.x

Sir, A 73-year-old man presented a solitary, well-circumscribed
erythematous lesion located on the thenar region of his right
palm. The lesion had developed at the site of a previous minor
injury and had slowly increased for the last 2°5 years (Fig. 1a).
The lesion felt fragile and delicate by the patient. Topical treatment with corticosteroids was of no benefit. Past medical history and physical examination were unremarkable.

Skin biopsy taken from the edge of the lesion showed a
moderately depressed epidermis of the affected area due to
a sharp difference between the thickness of the cornified layer
of involved and uninvolved skin. The affected area displayed
slight parakeratosis, discrete acanthosis with hypogranulosis
and a sparse dermal lymphocytic infiltrate. No cornoid lamellation was found in serial sections. Immunohistochemical staining showed an accumulation of the tumour suppressor gene
p53 as well as the cell proliferation marker MIB-1 in involved
skin. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of circumscribed
palmar hypokeratosis was established.

Because of the increased expression of p53 and MIB-1 in the
altered keratinocytes of the involved skin, treatment with
5-aminolaevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT)
was initiated. After a 5-h incubation with 20% 5-aminolaevuli
nic acid covered by a plastic foil to allow better penetration,
