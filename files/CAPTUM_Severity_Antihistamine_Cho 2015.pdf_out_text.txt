Abstract

Background Treatment guidelines for chronic spontaneous/idiopathic urticaria (CSU) are available; however, only
50% of patients are well controlled with approved doses of H,-antihistamines, and certain patients remain symptomatic
despite receiving up to 4x the approved dose of H,-antihistamines plus Ho-antihistamines and/or leucotriene-receptor
antagonists.

Objectives To highlight real-life clinical practice in Taiwan and to understand the unmet medical needs of CSU
patients.

Methods A nationwide cross-sectional, observational survey of 50 dermatologists and 200 CSU patients was conducted between June 2013 and November 2013. Face-to-face interviews of dermatologists and online interviews of
CSU patients were conducted independently.

Results Dermatologists reported that dermographism and blood tests were the most commonly used diagnostic methods to confirm the diagnosis. The key driving factor for most clinic-based dermatologists (70%) in choosing a treatment
was ‘response to my medicines’, and most preferred H,-antihistamines and steroids for treating CSU patients, whereas
most hospital-based dermatologists (85%) gave higher priority to ‘severity and impact of the conditions’. Patients were
reported to have high psychological pressures and significant impact of CSU on their daily activity. In addition, CSU
patients were not satisfied with their current treatment and 69% of patients switched their first-consulted physician. Furthermore, lack of information and concerns about side-effects were major factors which held back patients from seeking
Western treatment.

Conclusions There is an unmet medical need of CSU patients in Taiwan highlighting gaps among guidelines, real-life
clinical practice, patients’ perceptions and patients’ knowledge of their disease.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), also known as chronic
idiopathic urticaria, is the sudden appearance of wheals, pruritus
and/or angio-oedema (AnE), without any external physical trigger, lasting for >6 weeks.’ ° It is estimated that CSU is prevalent
in 0.5-1% of the population worldwide* ’; however, there are
limited data available on the prevalence of CSU in Asia, particularly in Taiwan.* '°

In general, treatment guidelines proposed by the European
Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, the Global

Allergy and Asthma European Network, the European

JEADV 2016, 30, 41-49

Dermatology Forum and the World Allergy Organization
(EAACVGA7LENEDPWAO) recommended non-sedating
H,-antihistamines as the first-line treatment for CSU patients.
However, up to 50% of CSU patients remain symptomatic
despite being treated with H,-antihistamines even at doses 3- to
4-fold higher than the approved doses, which is considered as
the second-line treatment.''!* Refractory CSU patients are recommended for add-on therapies that include omalizumab,

Taiwan. Although the treatment guidelines are well established,
the difference between treatment guidelines and real-life clinical
practice is rarely addressed.

To assess the burden of the disease and current unmet medical needs and to provide information on real-life clinical practice, a survey on the clinical practice of practising dermatologists
and treatment experience of CSU patients was conducted in Taiwan. The objectives of the survey were to focus on: (i) the different diagnostic methods used and the treatment considerations
of hospital- and clinic-based dermatologists for CSU patients;
(ii) the importance of prescription consideration when choosing
a treatment for CSU patients in a hospital- and clinic-based setting; (iii) the impact of CSU on daily life activities of these
patients; (iv) CSU patients’ source of information and treatment
journey in Taiwan; (v) CSU patients’ response to the current
treatment and their switching pattern; and (vi) the difference
between the patients’ perception and physicians’ management of
the disease.

Methods

Study design and participants

This nationwide survey in Taiwan was conducted by Kantar
Health in two parts. In part 1, face-to-face interviews with dermatologists (both hospital- and clinic-based) were conducted in
the physician’s office from 12 June 2013 to 3 July 2013. In part
2, online interviews with CSU patients were conducted from 25
September 2013 to 1 November 2013. During the interview process, both dermatologists and CSU patients filled their respective
questionnaires. All participants were provided with the full
information of the survey in writing. Written informed consent
was obtained from each participant. The data was processed in a
blinded manner in accordance with the Personal Information
Protection Act in Taiwan. The questionnaires were validated by
the authors by a presurvey pilot assessment involving two CSU
patients and two hospital-based dermatologists (data not presented).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

For the physician survey, dermatologists in practice for at least
3 years, who had spent at least 60% of the time in direct patient
care and attended at least 30 CSU patients on an average in a
month, were included. For the CSU patient survey, patients aged
31-60 years, diagnosed with CSU for 6 months or longer and
had suffered for 2 days or above in each week, who had a wheal
of >3 cm or above 50 wheals and had medium or severe pruritus, were included.

Statistical analysis

Independent t-test and 90% confidence intervals were used for
the subgroup analysis for hospital- vs. clinic-based dermatologists. For physicians’ face-to-face survey, each completed

questionnaire was checked during the interview period and if
needed, dermatologists were called back to complete missing
questions. Further, a quality and logic check was done for the
quality of the answer obtained from open-ended questions. For
the CSU patients’ online survey, a quality check was done for the
online set-up, logic of questioner and wording.

Results
Physician survey results

Baseline characteristics A total of 487 dermatologists were
screened, of which 50 dermatologists (30 hospital-based and 20
clinic-based) enrolled and completed the 40 min face-to-face
interview and questionnaire (Fig. 1). Overall, 50 eligible dermatologists attended 1534 outpatients in a month, of which 6%
(n = 96) of patients were diagnosed with CSU. AnE was present
in 27% of CSU patients, and was comparable for both the hospital- and clinic-based settings (28% and 26% respectively).

Diagnostic methods used by dermatologists for CSU
patients

The diagnostic methods used to confirm CSU were similar
between hospital- and clinic-based dermatologists, which
included evaluation of clinical symptoms (20% in each group),
patient history (17% vs. 25% respectively), dermographism test
(80% vs. 90% respectively), blood tests (63% vs. 35%
respectively), and/or autologous serum skin test (37% vs. 15%
respectively).

Different treatment considerations for CSU patients

The importance of treatment assessment factors, such as ‘frequency of attacks per week’, ‘frequency of AnE occurrence’,
‘itchiness’ and ‘response to antihistamines’, was similar on a
10-point scale (1 = lowest importance and 10 = highest importance) while comparing hospital- and clinic-based dermatologists. Of note, clinic-based dermatologists (70%) perceived
‘response to steroid’ as high importance (7-8 points), whereas
for hospital-based dermatologists, ‘severity and impact of the
conditions’ was the priority consideration (Fig. 2a). The order
of attributes by importance of ratings for the perception consideration varies between the hospital- and clinic-based dermatologists, ‘long-acting drug’
mechanism of action’ were the most significant differences
(Fig. 2b).

of treatment in hospital- and clinic-based settings respectively.
In hospital- and clinic-based settings, CSU patients with AnE
progressed sooner to the next line of treatment than those without AnE (3—4 weeks vs. 5 weeks) (Table 1).

About 50% of dermatologists had ever prescribed topical steroids alone, especially for those with minor symptoms and poor
compliance to oral medicine (Table 2). Regardless of the line of
treatment, most clinic-based dermatologists (60%; n = 12/20)
only prescribed oral antihistamines and steroids compared
with hospital-based dermatologists (13%; n = 4/30). A total of
80% (n= 16/20) of clinic-based and 50% (n = 15/30) of
hospital-based dermatologists prescribed antihistamine up to
4x the approved dose (off-label) to CSU patients with severe
symptoms and who had poor response to antihistamine/steroids
treatment (Table 2). Drowsiness was the most frequently
reported side-effect with 4x antihistamines. Immunosuppressants were prescribed more frequently by hospital-based dermatologists (77%; n = 23/30) than clinic-based dermatologists
(45%; n = 9/20; Table 2).

Overall, 48% (n = 24/50) of dermatologists did not use any
specific guideline for the management of CSU, of which 30%

CSU patient survey results

Baseline characteristics For the online CSU patient survey, a
total of 200 eligible CSU patients were recruited from 1 808 962
patients in the “GO survey’ database. All these eligible patients
completed the 30-min online questionnaire. ‘Quota design’ was
based on the Taiwan population composition. Of the total
enrolled patients, 40% (n = 80) were aged 31-40 years, 40%
(n = 80) aged 41-50 years and 20% (n = 40) aged 51-60 years;
53% (n = 107) were female and 47% (n = 93) were male. CSU
patients enrolled in the study had wheals of various types:
‘3 cm and >50 wheals’ (26%; n = 52), ‘<3 cm and >50 wheals’
(19%; m = 38) and ‘>3 cm and 10-50 wheals’ (55%; n = 110);
pruritus of high degree (33%; n = 66) and moderate degree
(67%; n = 134). The mean frequency of occurrence of these
symptoms in the patients was 4.2 times in a week, with a mean
urticaria activity score (UAS) of 4.6 (scale 0-6).

Impact of CSU on patients’ daily living activities

Among the 200 eligible patients, 104 (52%) patients perceived
that CSU had a stronger psychological pressure (life impact
score of 5.2 [scale 1-7]) than patients with other diseases,
including cancer (4.9) and stroke (4.7). The physiological
pressure from the symptoms of CSU was greater in the elderly
(51-60 years of age) group (60%) than the younger group
(31-40 years of age; 45%).

All CSU patients felt a higher impact (score 6-7 in a scale
of 1-7) on different life aspects, such as sleep (responded by
48% of patients), general daily activities (41%), appearance
(43%), work (34%) and interpersonal relationships (22%;
Table 3). CSU patients with a high UAS score of 5-6 had a
greater impact on their daily life activities compared with
patients with a low UAS score of 4. Furthermore, the high
impact on daily life activities (52%) and sleep quality (55%)
could play an important role in seeking Western treatment
(50%; n = 100). On the other hand, lack of information and

JEADV 2016, 30, 41-49

concerns about side-effects hold patients back from seeking
Western treatment.

CSU patients’ sources of information and their treatment
journey between Western vs. non-Western treatment

Sources of information The most common sources of information adopted by 200 CSU patients when they experienced symptoms at the first occurrence were asking relatives/friends (50%)
or searching for online information (49%). After diagnosis of
CSU, patients were more likely to rely on search engines (56%)
or discuss with medical professionals (38%) or relatives/friends
(34%; Fig. 3a). Information from medical professionals such as
physicians and nurses (65%), online search engines (64%),
health information display in hospitals (59%), asking relatives/
friends (56%) and health information leaflet provided by hospitals (55%) were considered the most reliable and preferred
sources by CSU patients (Fig. 3b).

CSU patients’ treatment journey Among the 200 CSU patients,
100 (50%) patients consulted Western physicians for their
treatment. The high life impact caused by ‘severe itching’ (87%;
n = 87/100) and ‘symptoms have influenced my daily life’ (70%;
n= 70/100) was the key factor for CSU patients to prefer
Western treatment over Chinese traditiona
trast, among the 100 non-Western treatment seeking CSU
patients, 48% of patients opted for the Chinese traditional medi
treatment. In con
cine, whereas 52% of patients preferred to ‘wait for it to recover
by itself, expecting the symptoms to subside spontaneously
without any treatment. The non-Western treatment seekers with
‘mild’ symptoms had ‘no impact on daily life’ (30%) and ‘appearance’ (26%). In addition, patients also did not seek Western
treatment because of ‘concerns regarding side-effects’ (44%) and
‘lack of information’ (31%). Furthermore, 35% of non-Western
treatment seekers had ‘no idea who is the right physician to go
for the treatment’.

Among the Western treatment seekers, 69% (n = 69/100) of
patients had lived with the symptoms for 2 months or longer
before visiting a physician. Dermatologists were the first choice
of consultation for 80% (n = 80/100) of CSU patients. Overall,

switched physicians for treatment (most had switched more
than once), even if their symptoms were under control with
the first treatment, largely (74%; n = 51/69) because of their
expectation of a better treatment efficacy. This reflects that
most of the CSU patients were not satisfied with their current
CSU management (Fig. 5). Among these 69 patients, 27
(39%) preferred dermatologists; however, there was a tendency for allergologists/rheumatologists (n = 11) and Chinese
medicine physicians (n = 1) to become patients’ choice when
they switched treatments. Out of these Western treatment
seekers, 65% continued their treatment and they mostly

In 42% (n = 42/100) of CSU patients, symptoms were not controlled with the standard dose of H,-antihistamine, and in 22%
of patients, symptoms were not controlled even with the uptitrated dose (4x) of Hj-antihistamine. Topical steroids (66%)
and oral antihistamines (58%) were the most commonly prescribed medicines by the Western physicians. About half of the

CSU patients in Taiwan had ever taken oral steroid along their
treatment journey (Fig. 6). On average, CSU patients received
treatment for approximately 19 months. Patients showed a
relatively high concern towards side-effects of oral steroids and
immunosuppressants. In addition, drowsiness was the major
concern with oral antihistamines reported by patients. Among
the small group (8%) who dropped out of treatment, ‘unsatisfying efficacy’ and ‘high cost’ were the main reasons.

Among all the therapies, CSU patients rated ‘reduce impact
on sleep’ (37% of patients scored 4.8 on a scale of 1-7), ‘convenient use’ (34%; 4.8) and ‘improvement of life quality’ (33%;
4.7) as important satisfaction criteria for the current treatment.
Comparatively, male patients showed higher satisfaction than
females on different life aspects. A large proportion (73%) of
non-Western treatment-seeker CSU patients visited the drug
stores directly. Topical steroid therapy was a much more
accepted (68%) treatment in such cases. Half of the Western
treatment seekers also went to the drug store probably for refilling their medicine. These clearly indicate a gap between the
atients’ perception and physicians’ management of the disease.

Discussion
The study identifies the differences in real-life clinical practice
and patient’s perception regarding the management of CSU, an
ighlights the unmet medical needs of these patients. Severa
gaps were found, particularly between treatment guidelines an
real-life clinical practice, between medical treatment an
patients’ satisfaction, and in patients’ knowledge about the disease.

For the gap between treatment guidelines and real-life clinica
ractice, we found that topical steroids were frequently prescribed although they were not the standard treatment for CSU
atients.'* However, about half of the patients had received ora
steroids. These clinical practices also correspond and highlight

 

an important difference between the clinic- and hospital-base
dermatologists; that is, more clinic-based dermatologists rate:
‘response to my medicines’ as being an important treatment
consideration.

 

In addition, blood tests were frequently used as a diagnostic
method. Most of these tests are not routinely recommended for
the diagnosis of CSU, especially the testing of allergens.” In contrast, an autologous serum skin test was less frequently performed. This practice represents a patient-oriented medical
decision and reflects a popular but incorrect belief among CSU
patients that CSU is always allergen mediated. Therefore, to circumvent unnecessary tests in clinical practice, patient education
on the disease and a better physician—patient interaction are
needed.

In regard to the gap between medical treatment and
patients’ satisfaction, we found that most of the patients were
unsatisfied with their treatment. Indeed, in some patients severe disease symptoms were difficult to control even with the

JEADV 2016, 30, 41-49

Cho et al.

third-line treatment. Many patients switched to other treatment modalities at some point even if their symptoms were
well controlled. To resolve this gap, in addition to using a
more convincing treatment, it is important to meet the
patients’ expectations. Consequently, more patients have a
better treatment experience in hospital rather than from other
modalities. Both hospital-based dermatologists and patients
gave higher priority to ‘reduce impact on sleep’, ‘long-acting
drug/convenient use’ and ‘improvement of life quality’ when
using a treatment.

Both the above mentioned gaps are interconnected and
resulted from the gap in patients’ knowledge about their disease. In Taiwan, treatment modalities include not only Western medicine, but also traditional Chinese medicine and other
forms of treatment. A similar pattern is observed in other
parts of the world as well.’® Patients’ knowledge and perception about their disease would be influenced by other treatment modalities and by the belief they hold.'” All of these
would influence drug compliance, patient-physician interactions and even medical decisions. To address these gaps, there
is a need to identify/develop a group of CSU experts and build
a platform or forum for patient education to bridge the
knowledge gap improve health care for CSU
patients.!2!? It is crucial to raise awareness of CSU, to
improve patient knowledge, as well as social consciousness, in

and to

a tone and manner that could catch patients’ attention.

In conclusion, this study reveals the unmet medical needs of
CSU patients in Taiwan and highlights several gaps in treatment.
First, a gap exists between guidelines and real-life clinical practice, including diagnostic methods, treatment considerations
and type of treatment prescribed, particularly because of the differences in treatment approaches between hospital-based and
clinic-based dermatologists. Second, a gap exists between medical treatments and the patients’ perception, leading to inadequate and unsatisfactory treatment response. In addition,
limited patient’s knowledge of the disease also poses another gap
in treatment. Limitations of this study are physician and patient
selection bias. The representative sample was smaller than
intended as not all physicians or patients were able to access or
use the internet. In addition, there may be a recall bias, as not all
patients were able to recall the treatment they received.
