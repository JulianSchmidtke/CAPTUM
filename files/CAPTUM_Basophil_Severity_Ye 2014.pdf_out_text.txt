Increased FesR10 expression with upregulated CD203c expression on peripheral basophils is
seen in patients with chronic urticaria (CU). However, there has been no published report
on the association between CD203c expression level and clinical disease activity in CU
patients. To investigate whether the increase of basophil activation is associated with the
disease activity of CU, we measured basophil CD203c expression using a tricolor flow

cytometric method in 82 CU patients and 21 normal controls. The relationship between the

percentage of CD203c-expressing basophils and clinical parameters was analyzed. The
mean basophil CD203c expression was significantly higher in CU patients than in healthy

INTRODUCTION

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common skin disorder characterized by persistent or recurrent itchy wheals that last for at least 6
weeks. The cause of CU is heterogeneous, as many triggering
and aggravating factors are involved in its pathogenesis, including physical stimuli, drugs, infections, and autoimmune mechanisms. The clinical phenotypes, severity, and prognosis of CU
differ from patient to patient, so that management strategies
need to be personalized. Recent guideline suggests a stepwise
treatment based on effective symptomatic control with non-sedating antihistamines up to four folds of dosage, which is often
efficacious but may not reach well-controlled state in 5% to as
many as 50% of CU patients (1, 2). The growing evidence that
autoimmunity and altered basophil functions are involved in
the pathogenesis of CU has accelerated the introduction of immunomodulating agents for refractory patients (1, 3-5). Accordingly, the need for safe and reliable in vitro diagnostic tools to
link each mechanism with reasonable therapeutic approaches
has increased. Although elevated plasma levels of metalloproteinase (MMP) 9, interlukin (IL) 6 and 18 and D-dimer have
been reported as possible biomarkers in association with CU
severity, those are not specific for the pathogenesis of CU (6-9).
Approximately half of CU patients are characterized by an autoreactive state with autoantibodies specific for the high-affinity

IgE receptor (FceRIa) and IgE itself (10). Although both the sensitivity and specificity of the autologous serum skin test (ASST)
are limited, it has been recommended for defining a subgroup
with autoreactive CU (10). However, the association between
ASST positivity and disease activity is inconsistent.

Basophils are rare granulocytes that resemble tissue mast
cells, in that they express FceRIa and release histamine and chemical mediators (11). In active CU patients, basophils infiltrate
the urticarial wheals and there is relative basopenia (12-14).
While peripheral basophils do not represent cutaneous basophils completely, basophil histamine release (BHR) using healthy donor basophils has been used to evaluate autoreactive CU
(15, 16). The basophil activation test (BAT) using flow cytometry has been applied as an in vitro diagnostic method for various allergic diseases (17). CD203c (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase [E-NPP3]) is a surface marker observed uniquely on
basophils and mast cells that is upregulated by anti-IgE antibody and allergens (18). For predicting causative allergens in
patients with food, insect sting and drug allergy, the measurement of basophil CD203c expression induced by various kinds
of allergens is reported to be useful (17, 19).

To-date, few studies have examined the phenotypes and characteristics of basophils in CU patients (14, 20, 21). Although the
expression of the basophil activation markers CD63 and CD69
is increased in CU patients (22), there is to our knowledge no

report of the clinical relevance of CD203c-BAT in CU patients.
Therefore, this study evaluated the association of basophil CD203c
expression with urticarial activity and autoimmunity in CU patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Subjects

This was a hospital-based, cross-sectional study including 21
healthy controls (NC) and 82 CU patients who had current urticarial symptoms almost daily for at least 6 weeks. CU disease
activity was assessed using the urticaria activity score (UAS),
which combines pruritus and four characteristics of wheals, including number, distribution range, mean diameter, and duration in total score range, 0-15, with higher scores indicating higher disease activity (23). After 3 months from the enrollment, we
reviewed medical records and calculated the medication requirement of each CU patient enrolled. Those patients requiring more than a third level of medication according to the guidelines or systemic steroids to control urticaria were classified as
severe CU (10).

Autologous serum skin test and measurements of total IgE
and anti-thyroid antibody

Antihistamines and corticosteroids were withdrawn at least 1
week before blood sampling. Intradermal autologous serum
skin test (ASST) was performed following the method by EAACI/GA°’LEN task force consensus report (10). Serum-induced
wheal of diameter greater by at least 1.5 mm than that of a control induced by saline at 30 min was accepted as positive. The
levels of total IgE were measured by the ImmunoCAP system
(Pharmacia Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Anti-thyroglobulin and thyroid
microsomal antibodies were detected by radioimmunoassay
(BRAHMS Aktiengesellschaft, Hennigsdorf, Germany).

Sampling and assays

The basophil CD203c expression was measured by flow cytometry. Subjects did not take any medication yet or stopped medication for at least one week before blood sampling. Whole blood
was collected in ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) tubes
and red blood cells (RBCs) were lysed with RBC lysis buffer
(0.154 M NH.Cl, 10 mM KHCOs;, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2-7.4). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the resuspended cells were stained with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated
antihuman CD203c (Beckman Coulter, Marseille, France), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antihuman CD123
(BD PharMingen, San Jose, CA, USA), and allophycocyanin
(APC)-conjugated antihuman human leukocyte antigen (HLA)DR (BD PharMingen), or isotype-matched controls on ice in
the dark for 30 min. After washing once with PBS, the cells were

44 = http://jkms.org

analyzed on a FACS Canto II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA). The cells were gated initially based on
the dot plot defined by the forward and side scatter, and then a
second gate of high FITC-CD123+ cells and low APC-HLA-DR
was defined to select the basophil population, analyzing at least
500 basophils. The percent CD203c expression was defined as
the percentage of basophils expressing more CD203c than the
critical point located at 10° < x < 10‘ in the histogram, which
was about 10% of the basophils incubated with buffer only in
the normal control. This was determined by defining region M1
on the histogram analysis.

Statistical analysis

The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to
determine the optimal cutoff of the percentage of CD203c-expressing basophils used to diagnose CU, and the area under the
curve (AUC) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed. Fisher’s test and the Mann-Whitney U-test were used to
compare the clinical characteristics of CU, including the positive rate of atopy, autoantibodies, and serum total IgE level. Spearman’s rho was used for the correlation analysis. Logistic regression was used to examine the effect of various factors on the
optimal cut-off of basophil CD203c expression and the risk for
severe CU. P values < 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. All statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS for Windows (ver. 12; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

Ethics statement

All of the subjects gave written informed consent at the time of
enrollment, and the study was approved by the institutional review board of Ajou University Hospital (AJIRB-GEN-GEN-09140).

RESULTS
The positive ASST, anti-thyroid autoantibody, and atopy rates
were 37.8%, 19.0%, and 39% in the CU patients, respectively

(Table 1). The mean white blood cell counts and differential for
basophils in peripheral blood were 7,297.5 + 2,248.8/yL and

Fig. 2. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis yielded 21.3% CD203cexpressing basophils as the optimal cut-off for discriminating chronic urticaria (CU)
from normal controls (NC). The sensitivity and specificity were 91.4% and 90.5%, respectively, with an AUC value of 0.963 (95% Cl, 0.932-0.995; P< 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity were calculated according to the identified optimal cutoffs, and
Pvalues were adjusted for age and gender.

0.5% + 0.2%, respectively. The 23 patients requiring at least thirdlevel treatment according to the guidelines were classified as
severe CU. The mean UAS was significantly higher in severe CU
(11.5 + 2.8 vs 9.8 + 3.2, P = 0.037), while their ASST response,
positive anti-thyroid autoantibody and atopy rates did not differ from non-severe CU patients.

In CU patients, the mean percentage of basophil CD203c expression at baseline was 57.5% + 23.9%, compared with an average activation of 11.6% + 8.0% of basophils in normal controls

the CU patients. The leukocyte differential of basophils in peripheral blood was significantly correlated with CD203c expression (r = -0.220, P = 0.049) and serum total IgE level (r = -0.237,
P= 0.033).

Taking a cutoff of 21.3% CD203c+ basophils as the positivity
threshold yielded a sensitivity of 91.4% and a specificity of 90.5%
with an AUC value of 0.9663 (95% CI, 0.931-0.995, P < 0.001).
After adjusting for age, gender, and atopy, the logistic regression
analysis revealed that the odds ratio for a 21.3% basophil CD203c
expression at baseline for detecting CU patients was 166.04 (95%
CI, 19.804-1392.071, P < 0.001, Fig. 2).

Severe CU patients had significantly higher CD203c expression than the non-severe group (66.5% + 23.3% vs 54.0% + 23.3%,
P = 0.033, Fig. 1). Using the ROC analysis of CD203c expression
to determine severe CU, a cutoff of 72.0% CD203+ basophils was
chosen as the threshold of severe CU. However, the sensitivity
(65.2%) and specificity (71.7%) were not remarkable (95% CI,
0.512-0.782). CD203c-expressing basophils = 72% (P = 0.005)
and a UAS 2 13 (P = 0.032) were significant, independent predictors of severe CU after adjusting for other factors, including
age, gender, atopy, and ASST results (Table 2).

DISCUSSION

This study confirmed previous reports (14, 21) that patients with
CU show increased basophil CD203c expression at baseline and
suggested that a cutoff basophil CD203c expression of 21.3% be
used for determining basophil activation in CU patients, with a
very high odds ratio of 166.04. Moreover, this study is the first to
suggest that patients with severe CU have higher levels of basophil activation.

We found a significant negative correlation between the number of peripheral basophils and both the percentage of CD203cexpressing basophils and total IgE level in CU patients. Previous
investigators suggested that basophils migrate from the circulation into wheals according to the urticarial activity (12). It has

been demonstrated that serum IgE upregulates the expression
of FceRI on human basophils both in vitro and in vivo (24). In
response to cross-linking of IgE and FceRI, human basophils
produce IL-3, which plays a crucial role in their development,
survival, and priming for greater expression of activation markers and histamine release in an autocrine manner (14, 25). Various surface markers expressed on human basophils, such as
CD63, CD69, and CD203c, have been used to demonstrate the
role of basophils in vivo and in vitro (11, 12). Compared with
other activation markers, the regulation of CD203c is not limited to the FceRI-mediated reaction, but is also induced by IL-3.
CD203c is thought to be the most useful marker of basophil activation and differentiation (18, 26, 27). The measurement of
basophil CD203c expression has been demonstrated to be useful for detecting causative allergenic components in patients
with wheat allergy and wheat dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis, insect sting and amoxicillin allergy (17, 19). If peripheral basophils of CU patients were sensitized by autoantibodies,
inflammatory mediators and other extrinsic stimulants during
the active urticaria, they would express a high amount of IgE
bound to FceRIo, on their surface. And then, as like basophils
from other allergic diseases are triggered by different stimulants
(19), they upregulate several activation markers including CD203c
on their surface. Notably, basophil CD203c expression was significantly higher in severe CU patients whose symptoms were
not completely controlled with antihistamines.

There are no convincing predictors of urticarial development
after antihistamine treatment or when patients can stop taking
immunomodulators. The guidelines emphasize using the UAS
in clinical practice to determine disease activity and the response
to treatment of CU (10). We also found that a UAS = 13 was a
significant determinant of severe CU. However, as one recent
study demonstrated (14), the ASST response was not reflected
in the basophil CD203c expression or the clinical severity of the
CU patients in our series. Flow cytometric BAT for CU patients
is usually performed to detect the serologic factors in the patients that trigger histamine release from donor basophils. Recently, several serological markers, such as MMP-9, IL-6, IL-18,
C-reactive protein and D-dimer, in association with the clinical
severity of CU have been suggested (6-9). Since the coagulation
factors, complement, and cytokines associated with chronic
low-grade inflammation, in addition to the IgE- and FceRI-dependent pathways, may activate basophils, a variety of diagnostic
tools should be used to further our understanding of CU. This
study enrolled 82 CU patients and obtained the optimal cutoff
for determining basophil activation in CU patients and identifying severe CU using ROC analysis, although a validation study
is needed in a second cohort. Therefore, BAT using CD203c expression can be extended to assess the degree of basophil activation for predicting the clinical severity of and treatment response to CU.

In conclusion, we suggest that the quantification of basophil
CD203c expression at baseline is useful for predicting severe
CU patients, who may need further treatment beyond antihistamines.
