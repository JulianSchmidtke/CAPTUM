ABSTRACT

Introduction: chronic urticaria (CU) is a skin disorder characterized by transient, pruritic
wheals persisting for longer than 6 weeks. The etiopathogenesis of the disease is still unclear, but there is evidence that autoimmunity and endocrine dysfunction may be involved.
Aim: the aim of this study was to determine whether chronic urticaria is statistically associated with thyroid autoimmunity. Patients and methods: in a prospective case-control study, we compared the frequency of thyroid auto-antibodies (thyroglobulin antibody,
anti-Tg and thyroid peroxidase antibody, anti-TPO) in 70 patients with chronic urticaria
and in 70 healthy volunteers. Thyroid auto-antibodies and thyroid hormones (thyroxine (T4),
triiodthyronine (T3) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were measured in all subjects.
Results: thyroid functional abnormalities were found in 8 (11.43%) patients. Anti-Tg and
anti-TPO were positive in 16 (23%) and 21 (30%) patients, respectively. In control group,
only one subject (1.42%) had abnormalities in thyroid hormonal status, and two subjects
(2.86%) had positive thyroid auto-antibodies. Compared with the control group, the frequency of both anti-Tg and anti-TPO was significantly higher in those with chronic urticaria
(P < 0.05). Conclusion: this study shows a significant association between chronic urticaria
and thyroid autoimmunity, and that tests to detect thyroid auto-antibodies are relevant in
patients with chronic urticaria.

Keywords: autoantibodies, autoimmunity, thyroglobulin, urticaria.

1. INTRODUCTION

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a skin
disorder defined as the occurrence
of daily, or almost daily wheals and
itching for at least six weeks. It is a
common disease affecting 0.5-1%
of the general population (1). The
pathophysiology of CU is not completely understood, although most
agree that the central event is activation of cutaneous mast cells. This
key pathophysiological event is predominant at the immediate phase of
inflammation, which progresses to a
complex interplay of varied proinflammatory mediators, cytokines,
chemokines, and adhesion molecules
that regulate vasoactivity and specific kinetics of cellular infiltration, ultimately evolving into a lymphocyte
and granulocytes mediated hypersensitivity reaction, evident as urticarial wheals (2). The autoimmune

ORIGINAL PAPER | MED ARCH. 2017 FEB; 71(1): 29-31

origin is the most accepted hypothesis advanced to explain inappropriate
activation and degranulation of mast
cells in urticaria. This theory is supported by the clinical association of
CU with various autoimmune disorders, the frequent detection of circulating autoantibodies, positive association with HLA subtypes DRB*04
and DQB1*0302 and therapeutic response to plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin (3-5).

The association of chronic urticaria with thyroid autoimmunity
has been known since 1983 (6), but
its frequency seems to vary in different reports. In literature reports, the
prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity
in CU patients varies from 4.3% to
57% and another 5-10% have clinically apparent thyroid disease (7-9).

Thyroid Autoimmunity in Patients with Chronic Urticaria

The aim of this study was to determine whether chronic urticaria is statistically associated with thyroid autoimmunity.

2. PATIENTS AND METHODS

The study included 70 patients with chronic urticaria
(40 female and 30 male). A detailed history and examination were taken in all study subjects, including patients
age, age at onset, duration of disease, associated diseases,
history of thyroid disorders and the extent and severity
of disease. The diagnosis of chronic urticaria was made
on clinical grounds. No patient was diagnosed before
this study as having any type of thyroid dysfunction. The
control group consisted of 70 volunteers (40 female and
30 male) who had skin diseases other then CU or autoimmune disorders. Blood samples were taken and a physical examination and thyroid sonography was performed.
Thyroid auto-antibodies (thyroglobulin antibody, anti-Tg, and thyroid peroxidase antibody, anti-TPO) and
thyroid hormones (thyroxine (T4), triiodthyronine (T3)
and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were measured
in all subjects. Total T4 (normal range: 70-180 nmol/L)
and total T3 (normal range: 1.3-3.3 nmol/L) were measured by use of radioimmunoassay (RIA); TSH (normal
range: 0.3-4.2 mlU/L) was determined by use of immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) (BRAHMS Aktiengesellshaft, Hennigsdorf, Germany). Serum levels of anti-Tg
(threshold value: 115 IU/mL) and anti-TPO (borderline
value: 34 IU/mL) were measured by use of electrochemiluminiscence immunoassay (ECLIA) according to
standard protocols (COBAS, Roche Diagnostics GmbH,
Mannheim, Germany).

Baseline clinical characteristics for the two groups
were compared with the use of Student's t-test for continuous variables, the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact
test (two-sided) for categorical variables, as appropriate.
Data were considered statistically significant at P <0.05.

Statistical analyses were performed using MedCale for
Windows, version 11.4.1.0 (MedCale Software, Mariakerke, Belgium).

3. RESULTS

We performed a cross-sectional study in 70 consecutive patients with chronic urticaria and 70 age- and sexmatched controls. Demographic data of patients and
controls are shown in Table 1. The mean (SD) age of the
patient and control groups was 40.39 (+14.39) and 40.71
(+15.30), respectively (P = 0.896). The duration of CU
ranged from 3 to 65 months. A family history of the same
disease was present in 5 (7.14%) patients. Thyroid functional abnormalities were found in 8 (11.43%) patients.
In the control group only one patient 8 (1.42%) had abnormalities in hormonal status.

Hypoechogenic thyroid tissue was seen in 7 (10%) patients who all had elevated levels of thyroid autoantibodies. The thyroid gland was enlarged in 5 (7.14%) patients.
Goitre was diagnosed in 4 (5.71%) cases. The ultrasound
examination of the thyroid gland in control group was
interpreted as normal in 64 (91.42%), and 6 (5.45%) volunteers had small simple goiter. Thyroid volume did not

30

differ significantly between the study patients and the
controls (p>0.05). In patients with chronic urticaria anti-Tg titers were ranging from 11.10 to 915.30 IU/mL and
anti-TPO antibody titers from 5.10 to 714.40 IU/mL. In
control group anti-Tg titers were ranging from 10.00 to
153.00 IU/mL, and anti-TPO antibody titers from 4.40 to
129.00 IU/mL. Anti-Tg antibody in 16 (22.85%) patients,
anti-TPO antibody in 21 (30%) and both anti-Tg and anti-TPO antibodies in 13 (18.57%) were higher than the
normal antibody titres. In the control group, one subject
(1.42%) had positive anti-Tg and one volunteer (1.45%)
had positive anti-TPO. The frequency of thyroid auto-antibodies was significantly higher in chronic urticaria patients than in control group (Table 2). A Chi-square test
for independence (with Yates Continuity Correction) indicated significant association between higher values of
anti-Tg (values more than 115 IU/ml) and chronic urticaria, x’ (1, n=140)= 13.123, P=0.0003. A Chi-square test
for independence (with Yates Continuity Correction)
indicated significant association between higher values
of anti-TPO (values more than 34 IU/ml) and chronic
urticaria, x’ (1, n=140)=19.468, P<0.0001.

4. DISCUSSION

Chronic urticaria has been reported in association
with numerous endocrine disorders. One of the main association is with thyroid abnormalities. In the literature,
the frequency of thyroid autoimmunity in patients with
CU encompasses a vast range of values, varying from 4.3
% (7) to 57.4% (8). In accordance to previous studies, we
also demonstrated that antithyroid autoantibodies were
significantly increased in patients with CU in comparison to healthy subjects. We detected elevated anti-Tg in
16 (22.85%) and elevated anti-TPO in 21 (30%) of patients
with CU. Usually about 5-10% of general population has
positive antithyroid antibodies; in this study the prevalence of auto-antibodies in control group is much lower
than expected. The difference it may partly be attributed
to genetic factors. Compared with the control group, the
frequency of both anti-Tg and anti-TPO antibodies was

ORIGINAL PAPER | MED ARCH. 2017 FEB; 71(1): 29-31
significantly higher in those with chronic urticaria. Our
results are consistent with a clinical study performed
by Palma-Carlos et colleagues (10). They performed a
case-control study to evaluate thyroid antibodies in CU
patients, and detected anti-Tg positivity in 22.2% and anti-TPO positivity in 26.8%. However, 93% of CU patients
had normal thyroid functions. The authors concluded
that thyroid antibody and function must be evaluated in
all cases of CU. In contrast, Feibelmann et al. found that
thyroid autoimmunity prevalence in CU patients is not
greater than that in control group (11).

As regards the type of thyroid antibody that was more
prevalent, our study shoved a higher prevalence of anti-TPO than anti-Tg. This is consistent with the results
of Aamir et al. (8) who demonstrated that anti-TPO had
higher prevalence than anti-Tg in his study group. Anti-TPO antibody, historically referred to as the antimicrosomal antibody, is established as a sensitive tool for
the detection of early subclinical autoimmune thyroid
diseases and identification of at-risk cases for autoimmune thyroid diseases (12). Nordyke et al. reported that
anti-TPO antibody tends to have more correlation with
thyroid dysfunction than does the anti-Tg antibody (13).

Although a specific mechanism linking the development of thyroid disease and CU has yet to be firmly
elucidated, it is widely thought that both diseases occur
because of a propensity within the patient to develop
reaction to self. It has been hypothesized that thyroid
disease may worsen urticaria through activation of the
complement system (9). Kirpatric noted that C4a levels
decrease when thyroid disease is treated, resulting in remission of CU (14). Therefore, while it is hypothesized
that thyroid disease and CU may coexist due to a patient’s
predilection for autoimmunity, thyroid disease may additionally exacerbate urticaria through direct mechanisms that result in complement activation. Contrary to
this, the antithyroid IgG antibodies may not be directly
involved in the mast cell degranulation and pathogenesis of the chronic urticaria, but only serve as indicators
of autoimmunity (7). O’Donnell et al. observed that patients with positive anti-TPO antibodies were more likely to demonstrate histamine-releasing auto-antibodies as
predicted by positive autologous intradermal skin testing and positive release in vitro of histamine from donor
basophil leucocytes (15). Increased bcl-2 expression in
activated T and B lymphocytes and increased CD40 expression on activated T cells have been found in these
patients. It is conceivable but unproven that cellular immunity initiated in the thyroid gland could trigger development of the skin lesions.

In addition, Altrichter et al. reported that some of
chronic spontaneous urticaria patients expressed IgE antibodies against TPO as a novel pathological mechanism
of chronic urticaria (16). These IgE-anti-TPO autoantibodies, when bound and activated on the surface of mast
cells, could cause “autoallergic” mast cell degranulation,
a novel pathogenic pathway of urticaria induction. Later
on, Shin and colleagues confirmed the presence of circulating serum specific IgE to TPO in CU patients and

showed the direct role of serum specific IgE to TPO in
effector cell with basophil activation test (17).

5. CONCLUSION

The study revealed a significant association between
chronic urticaria and thyroid autoimmunity and showed
the tests used to detect thyroid auto-antibodies to be relevant in patients with chronic urticaria.

Although cutaneous manifestations of autoimmune
thyroid diseases are well described and thyroid hormone
is known to regulate the development and function of
skin, a better understanding of these processes is needed.
It is a multidisciplinary problem requiring cooperation
of specialists in different fields of medicine. Both dermatologists and endocrinologists have to inquire their patients about the family history of autoimmune diseases
and to look for associated autoimmune disorders.
