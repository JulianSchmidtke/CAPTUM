Background: The etiology of chronic idiopathic urticaria
(CIU) is not completely clear. There are a few antibodies
were reported to correlate with CIU. Objective: To investigate the correlation these antibodies and CIU. Methods:
The autologous serum skin test (ASST) and allergens were
performed. Serum levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE), antiFc € Rl and anti-IgE, anti-Helicobacter pylori (HP) antibodies
and anti-thyroglobulin antibody (TGAb) were measured in
100 patients with CIU, acute urticaria (AU) and normal
controls respectively. Results: Eighty-six percent food or
inhalant allergens were detected in AU patients, but no
allergens were detected in CIU patients and normal controls.
Serum anti-Fc € RI antibody and anti-lgE antibody levels
were higher in the CIU than that in the AU patients and
normal controls (p< 0.05, respectively). IgE level was lower
in the CIU patients (T= 190.00, p< 0.05), but increased in
the AU patients (T=226.00, p<0.05) compared with the
normal controls. The ASST positive rates in the CIU and the
AU patients were 53.4% and 12.6% respectively, but all
normal controls were negative. The anti-Fc € RI antibody
level was higher in the ASST-positive CIU patients than those
negative ones (T=101.73, p<0.05). In anti-HP antibody
positive and TGAb positive CIU patients, anti-Fc € RI antibody positive rate was higher than AU patients (p< 0.01) and
normal controls (p < 0.01). Conclusion: The anti-Fc € RI and

INTRODUCTION

 

Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) affects 3% to 4% of
people and is defined as wheals that recur almost every
day, lasting more than 6 weeks. The etiology and pathogenesis of this refractory disease are still uncertain. Some
patients suffer from this disease for years or even decades.
Regarding its effect on quality of life, CIU is as worse as
heart disease’. However, recent findings suggest a role for
some antibodies related to CIU, but which of these antibodies is the most important and under what conditions
they work remain to be clarified. The purpose of this study
was to explore which of these antibodies plays a major
role in mast cell degranulation and under what condition
this pathogenesis is activated.

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects

 

Subjects were placed into CIU, acute urticaria (AU), or
normal control groups (n=100/group). The subjects were
15 to 63 years old in the CIU group (36 males and 64
females). The subjects were 20 to 65 years old in the AU
group (28 males and 72 females). The subjects were 22 to
69 years old in the normal control group (37 males and 63
females). Our subjects were age and sex matched as accu

rately as possible to decrease errors. Patients with urticaria
were chosen from the Department of Dermatology, Yantai
Yu Huang Ding Hospital affiliated to the Medical College,
Qingdao University. The diagnosis of CIU and AU was
made according to the criteria of the European Academy
of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI). According
to EAACI criteria, the CIU group criteria were: 1. The
patient had a history of recurrent wheals over 6 weeks
daily or almost daily. 2. No inhalant, food, infection, or
drug allergy evidence, and no other definite clinical
causes were found. Additionally, physical urticaria, cholinergic urticaria, hereditary angioedema, and _ urticaria
vacuities were excluded. 3. The patients had no history of
allergic diseases, such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, or atopic dermatitis, and no history of autoimmune diseases. 4.
Antihistamines were not used within 1 week, and steroids
or immunosuppressive drugs were not used within 1
month. 5. Subjects were also excluded if exact causes
were found during the study follow-up. The selection
criteria for the AU group were: 1. The course lasted <6
weeks, and no wheals were observed in the subsequent
6-week follow-up. 2. Exact causes were found. 3.
Antihistamine drugs and steroids or immunosuppressant
drugs were stopped 1 week and 1 month respectively
before the study began. The normal control group criteria
were no history of urticaria, asthma, allergic disease, or
autoimmune disease. Routine blood and urine tests and
liver and kidney function were normal. Women who were
pregnant or nursing were excluded. All subjects have
allergen screening test before inclusion in the research.
The hospital ethics committee agreed to all study
procedures.

Autologous serum skin test

The autologous serum skin test (ASST) was performed with
50 «| of the patient’s own serum intradermally injected
into the flexor aspect of the forearm; 50 11 of saline was
injected 3 to 5 cm away as a control. The results were
measured after 30 minutes. If the serum-injected site
manifested a wheal with a diameter at least 1.5 mm
greater than that of the saline-injected site, the result was
considered positive (Fig. 1);

Serum levels of anti-Fc ¢ RI and anti-immunoglobulin E
antibodies

Assays were performed with rat anti-human Fc é RI antibody and rat anti-human immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Rapidbio, Columbia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The plates were tested using an automatic quantitative microtiter plate reader (Anthos 2010) at a 450 nm

146 Ann Dermatol

to read absorbance value. The antibody levels were determined according to a standard curve.

Serum immunoglobulin E level detection

Serum IgE level was detected using a protein analyzer
(Dade Behring BNII System) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Anti-thymoglobulin antibody detection

Serum thyroglobulin antibody (TGAb) was assayed with
an E170 MODULAR Immunoassay Analyzer (Roche,
Basel, Switzerland). If the absorbance value was >115
IU/ml, the result was considered positive.

Serum anti-Helicobacter pylori antibody detection

A Urease Immunogold Testing kit (Colloidal Gold) was
applied to measure serum anti-HP antibody levels according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Statistical analysis

The data were recorded and processed using SPSS 16.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The positive rates are expressed as percentages and were analyzed using the x” test.
Numeric variables are expressed as medians and were
analyzed using the Wilcoxon test. A p-value <0.05 was
considered significant.

The anti-Fc € RI antibody positive rate was higher in antiHP antibody positive CIU patients than that in AU patients
(2? =9.76, p<0.01) and normal controls (x7 =18.33, p<

12.76, p<0.01). No anti-IgE antibody positive rates were
different among the experimental groups (%7=13.02, p>
0.05; Table 3).

DISCUSSION

 

Because no allergen could be detected in most CIU patients, the pathogenesis of this disease could not be explained by hypersensitivity type | reactions. The ASST of
some CIU patients was positive, indicating that some inflammatory mediators activated mast cells in a non-antigen-mediated manner to induce CIU. Subsequently, it was
confirmed that this histamine-releasing mediator was mast
cell antibodies, including the anti-Fc € RI antibody, antiIgE antibody, anti-HP antibody, and TGAb*. However,
which of these antibodies played the key role and under
what condition these antibodies act in CIU pathogenesis
were not clarified.

Our research showed that the anti-Fc € RI antibody and
anti-IgE antibody levels in CIU patients were significantly
higher than those in AU patients and normal controls, but
no difference was found between AU patients and normal
controls. This result indicates that both the anti-Fc € RI
antibody and anti-IgE antibody play an important role in
CIU pathogenesis. Moreover, we found that the anti-Fc € RI
antibody was higher in the ASST-positive CIU group than
that in the ASST-negative CIU group, whereas no significant difference in anti-lgE antibody levels was observed
between these two groups, suggesting that the anti-Fc € RI
antibody may play the key role in ASST-positive CIU.
However, the anti-Fc € RI antibody and anti-IgE antibody
were also detected in normal controls, but normal controls did not manifest CIU symptoms. This result suggests
that these autoantibodies could cause CIU only under
certain conditions. Anti-lgE antibodies produced first combined with IgE in the patient’s serum, resulting in low serum IgE levels in the CIU patients. When IgE level decreased, excessive anti-lgE antibody had the opportunity to
bind to IgE on the mast cell surface, leading to IgE crosslinking and activating the tyrosine kinase pathway, causing histamine release. The recombinant humanized antiIgE monoclonal antibody (omalizumab) reduces free serum IgE levels to treat airway hyper-reactivity. However,

this agent has the risk of causing severe urticaria or more
serious asthma possibly through the same mechanism.
Previous studies have reported that when serum IgE level
is low, the Fc€ Rl@ subunit could be exposed, providing
more opportunity for the anti-Fc € RI antibody to bind to
Fc éRI. This binding activates the tyrosine kinase pathway
causing histamine release’.

ASST was first proposed by Grattan et al.° to detect autoantibodies in CIU patients. The ASST-positive rate of CIU
is reported to be 30% to 60%”*. Some patients meet the
CIU diagnosis criteria but show a negative result. Our
research confirmed that the anti-Fc ¢ RI antibody plays a
key role in ASST-positive CIU. We detected allergens
using the Immuno CAP 250 system, which can detect 65
kinds of common allergens when screening subjects. Food
or inhalant allergens were found in most AU patients
(positive rate, 86%), indicating that AU is a type | allergic
reaction induced by an allergen. AU and CIU are completely different diseases and have completely different
pathogenesis, even though they have same clinical manifestations.

CIU has been correlated with HP infection. The HP infection rate in CIU patients is higher than that of normal
controls, indicating that the HP infection was related to
ClU®. Bakan et al.'°, showed that HP infection induce the
generation of anti-Fc € RI and anti-IgE antibodies through
‘molecular mimicry’. They showed that the Lewis polysaccharide X, Y antigen on the cytomembrane can induce
the expression of human leukocyte antigen-DR on gastric
mucosal epithelium cells and these cells acted similar to
antigen-presenting cells to generate antibodies. However,
Zauli et al."', found no relationship between HP infection
and CIU, and the symptoms of CIU did not improve after
HP treatment. The anti-HP IgG antibody can be detected
in both currently and previously infected patients, and its
positive rate is 33% to 36% in the normal population. In
this study, no anti-HP antibody positive rate difference
was confirmed among the CIU, AU and normal control
groups, but anti-Fc € RI antibody positive rate was higher
in anti-HP antibody positive CIU patients, than that in AU
patients and normal controls, which showed that the
anti-HP antibody may have an indirect relationship with
clu.
Zauli et al.'’. reported that autoimmune thyroiditis is related with CIU. Autoimmune thyroid disease and thyroid
antibody in patient with CIU was higher than that in
normal controls, indicating that thyroid antibodies might
be related with CIU. Some researchers believe that the
thyroid auto-antibody could induce histamine release by
cross-linking Fc € RI on the mast cells surface’*. Our study
found no TGAb-positive rate difference among the CIU,

AU, or normal contro!

groups, but anti-Fc € RI antibody

positive rate was higher in TGAb positive CIU patients,
than that in AU patients and normal controls, indicating
an indirect relationship between TGAb and CIU.

CIU is not strictly ‘idiopathic’ but is also called autoimmune urticaria. The anti-Fc € RI and anti-lgE antibodies

play the key role in CIU pathogenesis. Contrary to some
studies, anti-HP antibody and TGAb have no direct but an
indirect correlation with CIU. HP infection and autoimmune thyroid disease may have the same immune background with CIU.
