Abstract

Background The anti-IgE antibody omalizumab has been approved for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria
(CSU) in patients insufficiently responding to antihistamines. However, its mode of action in CSU is not clearly understood.

Objectives The aim of this study was to get a better insight in the immune mechanisms involved in clinical improvement of CSU patients treated with omalizumab.

Methods Chronic spontaneous urticaria patients (n = 15) were followed for 5 months after initiation of omalizumab
treatment. Clinical symptoms were assessed by UCT and CU-Q,0L. Cell-bound IgE was quantified on both FceRI- and
FceRIl-expressing cell populations in peripheral blood. In addition, IgE and IgG as well as their receptors were measured
on basophils, and basophil activation was assessed with different concentrations of anti-FceRI and fMLP. Furthermore,
the frequencies of different T-cell subsets secreting IL-5, IL-10, IL-31 or IFN-y were analysed by ELISpot assay.

Results Seven patients showed a full, five a partial and three no clinical response to omalizumab. Cell-bound IgE was
reduced on FceRI-bearing cells, but not on FceRil-expressing cells. Likewise, the expression of FceRI declined. Basophil
activation increased upon FceRI-stimulation while their sensitivity was not affected. Both basophil and T-cell frequencies
remained unchanged. However, when comparing the individual response to omalizumab treatment with distinct T-cell
subsets, a significant correlation was found between improved UCT and decreased frequencies of IL-10-, IL-31- and
IFN-y-secreting T cells.

Conclusions We here show that besides addressing IgE-dependent immune mechanisms, omalizumab treatment of
CSU patients has effects on distinct T-cell subsets, which correlate with clinical improvement.

Introduction

Patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) suffer from
recurrent wheals and pruritus induced by the release of inflammatory mediators from cutaneous mast cells. How mast cells are
activated in CSU is still the focus of intense research. In approximately one-third of CSU patients, IgG autoantibodies against

against different autoantigens can be detected.*” Besides mast
cells, basophils leaving the peripheral blood compartment and
migrating into the skin might be of pathological relevance. The

basophils are non-responsive to stimulation of the FceRI.'°"!
An important question is if other immune cells besides mast cells
and basophils might play an important role in the pathogenesis
of CSU. In this regard, FceRIo-specific T cells have lately been
described in peripheral blood of CSU patients.’*
First-line treatment of CSU is antihistamines blocking the
binding of histamine released by mast cells and basophils to the
histamine receptor 1. However, only about 60% of CSU patients
benefit from this treatment.'* For patients that do not suffi
ciently respond to antihistamines, the monoclonal anti-IgE anti
 

body omalizumab was approved, which has been shown
efficacious in up to 80% in several studies.'*"° While its clinical
efficacy is well established, the immunological mode of action of
omalizumab in CSU is not that well understood. So far, it has
been demonstrated that omalizumab reduces free serum IgE,”
thereby leading to a reduction of cell-bound IgE and downregulation of cell surface FceRI expression. '* ?! Furthermore, basophil releasability upon IgE-mediated activation, which is

and low total serum IgE levels might even be an
indicator of treatment failure.**

To better understand the immunological effects of omalizumab in CSU and shed more light on the pathogenesis of this

disease, we conducted an experimental study investigating

of and during therapy with omalizumab. An additional point of
interest was to identify potential biomarkers indicating a therapeutic response to omalizumab.

Methods

Patients

A total of 15 patients (12 females/3 males) with CSU non-sufficiently controlled by antihistamines were treated with 300 mg
omalizumab subcutaneously every 4 weeks and followed for up
to 20 weeks. All patients suffered from CSU for more than
8 weeks. Chronic as well as acute infections were ruled out as a
possible trigger by history and routine blood analysis. None of
the patients had received systemic corticosteroids within the last
4 weeks or was previously treated with omalizumab. During the
study period, patients were allowed to take non-sedating antihistamines. Peripheral blood was drawn for further analysis before
the first (V1), second (V2), third (V3), fourth (V4) and sixth
(V5) injection of omalizumab. Two of the patients discontinued
the study after V4 (patient #5 and #9; Table 1) due to non-treatment related reasons. Clinical symptoms were recorded by the

Results

CSU patients show a differentiated clinical response to
anti-IgE treatment
Patients with CSU were treated for up to 5 months by monthly
subcutaneous injections of the monoclonal anti-IgE antibody
omalizumab and analysed before as well as after one, two, three
and 5 months of treatment (Fig. la). Clinical evaluation by
UCT and CU-Q,0L revealed a significant improvement of symptoms in most patients already after 1 month of treatment
(Fig. 1b,c; P < 0.001). Within the group of omalizumab responders, seven patients showed full and five partial response to omalizumab according to our grading system at the final visit.
However, three patients did not improve until the last visit in
comparison with pretreatment values (Table 1, patients #13—15,
indicated in bold). Notably, two of these three patients were less
severely affected when starting omalizumab.

All patients showed an 1.2- to 11-fold increase of total serum
IgE as determined by using two independent detection systems
indicating the well-known development of IgE-omalizumab

 

 

 

 

complexes (Fig. 1d,e; P< 0.05), which results in enhanced
serum IgE concentrations due to an extended half-life of complexed IgE.**”* It has been speculated that serum IgE measured
by ADVIA Centaur would quantify free IgE in an indirect fashion due to competing epitopes for the detection antibodies and
omalizumab.** However, we found a strong correlation of total
IgE measured by ADVIA Centaur and ImmunoCAP (r
—0.9700, P < 0.0001, data not shown).

Depletion of cell-bound IgE

To evaluate the amount of IgE bound to cell surface receptors,
IgE was stained on FceRI- and FceRII-bearing cells, in order to
obtain a relative measure for total cell-bound IgE on different
cell populations. This staining strategy is based on the size and
granularity as well as the distribution of either FceRI or FceRII
on different cell populations (Figure $1). By this means, we were
able to quantify IgE on FceRI+ (basophils, monocytes/dendritic
cells) and FceRII+ cells (B cells, eosinophils/neutrophils). Here,
a significant reduction was detected on FceRI-bearing cells like
basophils (Fig. 2a; P < 0.001), monocytes and dendritic cells
(Fig. 2c; P < 0.001), but not on FceRII-expressing cells like eosinophils and B lymphocytes (Fig. 2b,d).

Reduction of IgE and FceRI on basophils

Basophils have gained interest in the pathophysiology of CSU.
Not only as a peripheral blood surrogate of cutaneous mast cells,
but also because basopenia is a common feature in CSU.** Several studies have described diminished basophil-bound IgE and

decreased expression of its high-affinity receptor, FceRI, during
omalizumab treatment.'**° Likewise, patients in this study
showed a reduced MFI of cell surface IgE and FceRI expression
after 1 month lasting for the whole treatment period compared
to pretreatment levels (Fig. 3a,b; P < 0.001). To investigate these
parameters in more detail, we specifically focused on their presence on basophils. Notably, we detected declining numbers of
IgE+ basophils (Fig. 3c; P < 0.05) but not of FceRI+ basophils
(Fig. 3d). Thus, while surface IgE and FceRI is diminished by
omalizumab, more than 60% of basophils still have IgE bound
to their surface and 90% continue to express FceRI.

Since basophils also exhibit FcyRII, which is able to inhibit
IgE-mediated basophil activation,” its expression and the presence of IgG bound by the receptor was determined on basophils.
However, no significant changes were detected during omalizumab treatment (Fig. 3e,f).

Basophil reactivity increases upon omalizumab treatment
Since increased peripheral blood numbers’! and sensitivity’ of
basophils have been linked to a more moderate course of CSU,
these parameters were also closely investigated in the present
study. However, quantifying basophil frequency in peripheral
blood by flow cytometry, we could not detect a rise of basophil
numbers during omalizumab treatment although a trend
became apparent at V2 (P = 0.08; data not shown). Notably, all
patients showing pretreatment basopenia (< 0.1% of peripheral
blood cells, n = 5) responded to treatment (either fully (n = 3)
or partially (n = 2); Table 1, indicated in light grey) and in the
majority of these (4/5) the number of basophils normalized.
Interestingly, one of the patients who did not experience a benefit by omalizumab developed basopenia during the study
(Table 1, #15).

Figure 3 The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of IgE (a) and
FceRI (b) was quantified on the surface of basophils by flow cytometry. In addition, the percentage of IgE+ (c) and FceRI+ (d) as well
as IgG+ (e) and FcyRIl+ (f) basophils of CSU patient before and
during omalizumab was determined. Statistical significant differences *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001.

 

To investigate their reactivity to FceRI-mediated activation,
basophils were stimulated with different concentrations of
anti-FceRIa. Thereby three basophil phenotypes could be differentiated as recently published’: firstly, reactive to antiFceRIa (CU-R, 60%), secondly, non-reactive to anti-FceRIo
(CU-NR, 7%) and thirdly non-reactive with basopenia and
already preactivated basophils (CU-NRgo, 33%). Upon omalizumab therapy, this distribution shifted towards a more reactive phenotype (CU-R: 67%, CU-NR: 13%, CU-NRgo, 20%,
Table 1). In addition, the median dose-response curves
showed an enhanced frequency of activated, CD63+ basophils
compared to pretreatment numbers (Fig. 4a). Increased basophil activation became even more obvious by calculating the
AUC (Fig. 4b; P < 0.05). In contrast to the AUC, which is a
measure that combines reactivity and sensitivity of basophil
activation, the ECs, reflecting the concentration giving halfmaximal activation, displays only the sensitivity.** Here, the
ECs9 of FceRI-mediated activation remained unchanged during omalizumab treatment (Fig. 4c). In addition, non-specific
stimulation by fMLP also resulted in increased basophil activation albeit not as distinct and only at some time points

Figure 4 Basophils of patients with CSU were stimulated with
different concentrations of anti-FceRla and median doseresponse curves were compared before and during the course
of omalizumab therapy (a). The area under the curve of the
individual dose-response curves (b) and the respective doses
giving half-maximal activation, the ECso, were calculated (c).
Some of the CSU patients’ basophils could not be activated
by anti-FceRla. Their ECs9 was arbitrarily set to 0.001. As an
unspecific control stimulus, fMLP was used to activate basophils in an FceRl-independent way (d). Statistical significant
differences *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.

 

(Fig. 4d; P < 0.05). In summary, basophil reactivity to antiFceRIa increases, without affecting the sensitivity.

Omalizumab therapy leads to T cellular alterations

Since previous studies showed elevated T cellular cytokine concentrations like IL-10°° and IL-31*° in untreated CSU patients
and a decrease of IL-31 serum concentrations during omalizumab treatment,*! the question arose if the frequency of T cells
secreting these cytokines would be altered by omalizumab therapy. In addition, the number of IFN-y- and IL-5-secreting cells
as marker cytokines for T};1 and T;,2 cells was assessed, respectively. Within the whole cohort of treated patients, the investigated T-cell frequencies did not change statistically (Fig. 5a—d).
However, there was a trend to reduced frequencies of IFN-y-,
IL-10- and IL-31-secreting cells in the first visits during omalizumab treatment.

Therapeutic efficacy correlates with decreased numbers
of IL-10- and IL-31-secreting cells

To identify potential biomarkers for clinical outcome of omalizumab therapy, the investigated immune parameters were correlated with treatment response at the final visit (AV1I—V5).
Correlating the alterations in IL-10+, IL-31+ and IFN-y+ cells
with the improvement in UCT, an inverse relationship was

Discussion

In 2014, the monoclonal humanized anti-IgE antibody omalizumab was approved for the treatment of antihistamineresistant CSU in the European Union and in the United States.
Several double-blind placebo-controlled'*7*
ies** have proven its clinical efficacy in CSU. However, the
mechanisms by which omalizumab leads to improvement in

and real-life stud
CSU are still under investigation. To shed more light on its
mode of action, we analysed different immune parameters in
CSU patients treated for 20 weeks with omalizumab and correlated them with clinical efficacy. Interestingly, besides its known
effects on IgE-mediated immune mechanisms, omalizumab
affected distinct T-cell populations with clinical improvement
primarily associated with decreased frequencies of IL-10-, IL-31and IFN-y-secreting cells.

Several studies have investigated the impact of omalizumab
therapy on IgE in the serum as well as fixed on cells, reporting
that free IgE is cleared from the circulation'’ and subsequently
also lost from the cell surface'*? by an indirect fashion since
omalizumab cannot target receptor bound IgE.***° Thus, pathogenic IgE autoantibodies directed, for example, against thyroid
peroxidase* or IL-24° should be depleted. Since IgE itself might
also serve as an autoantigen,>“° removal of IgE antibodies complexed with omalizumab should also have an impact on CSU
symptoms. In addition to IgE, the expression of its high-affinity

as shown here and by others.*®*” Basophil-bound IgE declined
already after the first omalizumab application, accompanied by a
strong reduction of FceRI expression. Of note, a very recent
study reported that reduced surface density of FceRI is not only
seen on basophils, but also on skin ce itt
Different patterns of basophil activation to anti-IgE or allergen

with a previous report’? basophil reactivity rather increased.

of basophils during omalizumab therapy, their number did not
rise significantly, which is in line with a previous report by Metz
et al.'* but in contrast to another recently published study.”
Nevertheless, all of the basopenic patients included responded at
least partially to omalizumab treatment, with the majority displaying a substantial recovery of their basophil number. It is
assumed that basophils of CSU patients migrate to the affected
skin, because they are more abundant in cutaneous lesions of
CSU patients than in healthy control skin.*° Moreover, they are
recruited to the skin after autologous serum injection in patients
with autoreactive CSU.*! Hence, it could be hypothesized that in
basopenic patients the response to omalizumab treatment is
partly due to diminished basophil migration to or redistribution
from the skin resulting in normalization of basophil numbers in
peripheral blood.

A major finding of our study is the association of reduced
T-lymphocyte frequencies, namely cells secreting IL-10, IL-31
and IFN-y, with the improvement of clinical symptoms during
omalizumab therapy. Evidence for an involvement of T cells in
CSU stems from examinations showing enhanced frequencies of
CD4+ and CD8+ cells in CSU patients compared to healthy control skin?! and increased cutaneous mRNA expression of IFN-y,
IL-4 and IL-5.° Beyond that, in peripheral blood of CSU
patients T-cell cytokines like IL-31,*° IL-17 and IL-33® are elevated and IFN-y-secreting, autoreactive T lymphocytes targeting
FceRIa can be found.'* For this reason, we investigated the
influence of omalizumab on different T-cell subsets. While the
frequencies of IL-5-, IL-10-, IL-31- and IFN-y-secreting cells
remained unaltered in the whole cohort of studied patients,
treatment response correlated with decreased numbers of IL-10-,
IL-31- and IFN-y-secreting T lymphocytes. Thus, omalizumab is
not only affecting IgE-mediated immune mechanisms and
immediate type effector cells but in addition seems to modulate
inflammatory T-cell responses. This is also suggested by reduced
serum levels of IL-31 in CSU patients*? and diminished

So far, the role of T cells in CSU remains obscure; however, the
clinical efficacy of the T-cell suppressant drug cyclosporine further affirms the importance of targeting T cells in CSU.°*°° Considering CSU an autoimmune disease,” !”

phocytes to become autoantibody-secreting plasma cells.
During omalizumab treatment, FceRI is reduced on dendritic
cells and monocytes as antigen-presenting cells.°” While IgE
fixation on this receptor is crucial for efficient FceR-mediated
antigen presentation to T cells,°!? we here show that IgE is
rather diminished on these cells. Thus, omalizumab might indirectly reduce the percentage of inflammatory T cells by preventing binding of IgE to the FceR on antigen-presenting cells and
thereby prohibit their stimulation of T cells.

One limitation of this trial is the relatively low number of participants. Our investigation was setup as a pilot study covering a
variety of different cellular and molecular parameters, thereby
uncovering potential immunological candidates of pathophysiologic relevance targeted by omalizumab. Furthermore, we cannot
exclude that we might have missed very early immune effects initiated by omalizumab days or even hours after its first application.

In summary, while we were able to confirm important influences of omalizumab on its primary target, IgE and IgE-dependent parameters like FceRI expression and basophil releasability,
we also could show that omalizumab has an impact on inflammatory T-cell activity, as observed by a significant correlation
between clinical treatment response and reduced numbers of IL10-, IL-31- and IFN-y-secreting cells. Our results thus point to
an extended spectrum of immune alterations induced by antiIgE antibodies, opening potential new perspectives for their therapeutic implementation.
