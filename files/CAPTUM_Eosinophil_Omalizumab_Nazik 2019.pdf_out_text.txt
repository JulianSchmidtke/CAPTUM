Introduction: Omalizumab is a current treatment option for IgE-associated dermatoses, such as urticaria and atopic

dermatitis.
Aim: To evaluate the clinical and laboratory
received omalizumab.

Material and methods: This study was planned as a cross-sectional and retrospective one. One hundred forty-six
cases were included in the study. Omalizumab at a dose of 300 mg for patients with chronic urticaria and 600 mg
for patients with atopic dermatitis, was given every 4 weeks. The response to the given treatment and remission

status of patients were investigated.

Results: Of 146 patients included in the study, 70.5% (n = 103) were female and their mean age was 42.3 +13.8
(min.—max.: 14-85). Of the patients, 136 had chronic urticaria and 10 had atopic dermatitis. 29.9% (n = 26) of patients with chronic urticaria had a complete response to omalizumab treatment, whereas 40% (n = 4) of patients

with atopic dermatitis had remission.

 

Conclusions: The decline of complaints with different treatment schemes in different patients suggests that treatment should be designed individually and that personal biomarkers playing a role in the effectiveness of the drug
are important. Patients with the high IgE and eosinophil percentages and positive autologous serum test had a better treatment response to omalizumab treatment. Meanwhile, remission was found to be more frequent in atopic
dermatitis patients with omalizumab treatment compared to the patients with urticaria. It may be more appropriate
to choose patients based on certain criteria to ensure cost-effectiveness in omalizumab treatment.

Key words: omalizumab, chronic urticaria, atopic dermatitis, immunoglobulin E.

Introduction

IgE is an immunoglobulin that has an important role
in acute allergic reactions and chronic inflammatory alergic diseases. Omalizumab is a recombinant, humanized antibody developed against immunogloibulin E (IgE).
Omalizumab affects by regulating the high-affinity IgE
receptor FceR, and reducing the amount of free IgE, mast
cell and basophil activation [1]. It has been approved by
he Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of
moderate severe asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria that does not respond to H1 antihistamines. Meanwhile, omalizumab was used as an off-label in some
gE-related diseases and successful results have been reported. Moreover, it has been reported that omalizumab
improved clinical symptoms in diseases such as systemic

 

 

 

mastocytosis, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, allergic rhinitis, nasal polyposis and keratoconjunctivitis [2].

Aim
The aim of this study is to present clinical and demo
graphic data of patients with chronic urticaria (CU) and
atopic dermatitis (AD) treated with omalizumab.

Material and methods

From June 2014 to November 2017, 146 patients,
diagnosed with CU and AD, who received omalizumab
treatment, were evaluated. The patients’ files were
scanned and demographic, laboratory and clinical data
were obtained retrospectively. The approval for the study

was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Medical
Faculty of Kahramanmaras Stitcti Imam University (the
decision date: 20.12.17, decision no. 6, session: 2017/21).
The study was conducted in accordance with the Decaration of Helsinki. Urticaria, which lasted longer than
6 weeks, with or without angioedema, was considered
as CU. The diagnosis of AD was made according to anamnesis, physical examination and laboratory findings.
The pre-treatment IgE level, thyroid-stimulated hormone
(TSH) value and percentage of eosinophils were recorded.
The duration of disease, the presence of angioedema,
revious and concurrent treatments were investigated.
The number of total omalizumab injections administered
to the patient, the number of injections after which the
treatment was effective, the number of injections after
which recurrence was seen and the duration of treatment discontinuation were determined. The clinical response of omalizumab was assessed as follows: those
who continued to receive antihistamines in a licensed
dose after omalizumab discontinuation were recorded
as “complete response”, patients who were able to control their complaints with omalizumab together with
antihistamines were recorded as “partial response” an
patients whose complaints continued despite omalizumab treatment with antihistamines were recorded as
“no response”. The absence of any antihistamine treatment for at least 6 months after omalizumab treatmen
was considered as “remission” [3]. Patients with AD who
had a normal skin appearance for at least 6 months
and who did not need antihistamines were considere:
as “remission” [4]. The last status was evaluated as the
end of treatment, ongoing treatment, and the follow-up
discontinuation. The applied doses and complications o
omalizumab were recorded. Omalizumab was given once
a month by subcutaneous administration of 300 mg
for patients with CU and 600 mg for patients with AD.
300 mg of omalizumab was given every 3 weeks to 8 patients with complaints, which were increased during the
last week of the 4-week interval. Patients whose treatment had been terminated due to a complete response
were followed up until July 2018. The time from the complete response to the determination of complaints and
the remission prevalence was identified.

Statistical analysis

SPSS v.17.0 package program was used for statistical
evaluation of data obtained in the study (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Continuous data were summarized as
mean + standard deviation, while categorical data were
summarized as number and percentage.

Student’s t test was used to compare the IgE and
eosinophil percentages of patients with a complete and
partial response. The y? test was used to compare the
relationship between the autologous serum skin test and
treatment response.

Results

Of 146 patients receiving omalizumab treatment,
70.5% (n = 103) were female and 29.5% (n = 43) were
male. Of cases, 93.2% (n = 136) were patients with CU
and 6.8% (n = 10) with AD and the mean age was 42.3
+13.8 years (min—max.: 14-85). The mean duration of disease was 53 +52.9 months (min.—max.: 3-240 months).
47.1% (n = 64) of patients with CU reported the angioedema attack at least once. In 4 (2.7%) patients with
CU receiving omalizumab treatment, the value of thyroid stimulating hormone was outside of the reference
range (0.35-5.5 mlU/l). 6.6% (n = 9) of CU cases were
treated because of thyroid pathology. Thyroid pathology
was not detected in AD cases. Of 31 CU patients who
underwent an autologous serum test, 11 (35.5%) patients
had positive results. Of patients with the positive test
result, 8 (72.7%) patients had a complete response and
3 (27.3%) patients had a partial response. A complete
response was found to be statistically quite significant
in patients with the positive autologous serum test
(p = 0.001). The demographic and laboratory data of the
patients are presented in Table 1. The initial percentages
of IgE and eosinophils of patients with CU and AD who
had the complete and partial response with omalizumab
treatment are presented in Table 2.

25.3% (n = 37) of the cases used at least two different H1 antihistamines in the licensed dose before omalizumab treatment. The rest of the cases used systemic
corticosteroids and H2 receptor blockers for less than
20 days in addition to H1 antihistamines. Of the patients
who used steroids and antihistamines, 6 used leukotriene antagonist (LTA), 12 used ketotifen, 2 used doxepin
and 5 used cyclosporin. All 10 patients with AD (100%) received oral antihistamine, topical moisturizer and topical
steroid treatment, and 5 (50%) patients received narrowband UVB treatment for 6 months. Omalizumab treatment was initiated when remission was not achieved
despite the use of the indicated treatments.

Chronic urticaria cases received omalizumab injections on average 9.5 +7.0 times (min.—max.: 1-32) and AD
cases received omalizumab injections 4 +2.5 times (min—
max.: 1-7). The treatment with omalizumab was effective
with an average of 1.2 +0.6 (min.—max.: 1-4) injections

in urticaria cases and an average of 1.1 +0.6 (min—max.:
0-2) injections in AD cases. 87.7% (n = 128) of patients
receiving omalizumab did not have recurrence during the
treatment. In the remaining cases, complaints increased
after an average of 7.8 +2.3 (min—max.: 3-24) injections.
Of the cases, 88.4% (n = 129) were treated without interruption, while 11.6% (n = 17) cases had on average 2.4
+0.5 (min.—max.: 1-3) months’ intervals. The treatment
response of the patients was evaluated. Sixty-four percent (n = 87) of the patients had a complete response,
33.8% (n = 46) had a partial response, and 2.2% (n = 3)
had no response. 50% (n = 5) of AD cases had a complete
response and another 50% (n = 5) had a partial response.
When the drug-related complications were evaluated, it
was noticed that tachycardia developed in a single case.

dose. In cases where treatment is not responsive, in the
second-line treatment, the dose of the drug is 4 times
higher. If the dose increase is not effective, one of antagonists (omalizumab, cyclosporine and leukotriene) is
recommended for the third-line treatment [7].
According to the literature about the usage of omalizumab in CU cases, it has been reported that 150 mg
of omalizumab was an effective dose in some patients,
while some studies have suggested that 300 mg is the
optimal dose [8, 9]. In our clinic, 300 mg of omalizumab was used monthly in patients with CU. However, in
8 cases, 300 mg was used every 3 weeks due to the increase in complaints during the fourth week. The decline
of complaints with different treatment schemes in different patients suggests that treatment s

It is known that CU is seen more frequently in women and more frequently in third and fourth decades. In
this study, in accordance with the literature, 71.3% of CU
patients were female and their mean age was 41.9. In
a study conducted by Kim et al., urticaria-associated co
 

the treatment, 20% (n = 2) discontinued the follow-up.
The mean time of complaints in patients with CU whose
treatment was terminated due to a complete response
was 10.02 +5.03 months (min—max.: 6-42 months). The
remission was detected in 29.9% (n = 26) of CU patients
with a complete response and in 40% (n = 4) of patients
with AD.

 

Discussion

Omalizumab is a monoclonal IgG1 antibody that specifically binds to the FceR| domain of serum IgE. Omalizumab inhibits IgE binding to the high-affinity receptors
on mast cells, basophils, macrophages and dendritic
cells. At the same time, the serum reduces free IgE levels
and reduces the IgE receptor level [5]. The use of omalizumab has been approved for chronic spontaneous urticaria not responding to H1 antihistamines for ages 12 and
above [6]. Chronic spontaneous urticaria is characterized
by itchy, red, and puffy lesions that appear as attacks for
6 weeks or longer without any reason. According to the
international urticaria guidelines, the first choice in the
treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria should be the

morbidities such as

allergic rhinitis, drug allergy, asthma,

 

 

 

thyroid disease, and cancer were found [10]. In this study,
6.1% (n = 11) of the cases had thyroid pathology.
The relationship between IgE and eosinophil percentage and diseases was investigated. A study reported that
the percentage of eosinophils was significantly higher in
patients with AD and correlated with clinical severity of
the disease [11]. In another study, serum IgE levels were
found to correlate with the prevalence of lesions [12]. In
a study investigating the aetiology of urticaria, it was
found that there was no significant difference in IgE and
eosinophil percentages between different urticarial forms
[13]. The results of our study were consistent with the
literature. The effect of IgE and eosinophil percentage on
the response to omalizumab treatment was evaluated. It
was seen that these biomarkers were higher in patients
with a complete response. In this study, it was concluded that patients with CU and AD with a high percentage
of IgE and eosinophil respond better to treatment with
omalizumab.

The positivity of the autologous serum test supports
autoimmune urticaria. In one study, it was suggested
that the use of omalizumab would be beneficial in pri

mary treatment-resistant cases rather than immunosuppressive treatment in the treatment of autoimmune
urticaria [14]. In this study, consistent with the literature,
cases with a positive autologous serum test responded
better to omalizumab treatment.

In a study conducted, omalizumab was reported to
be effective after 3 days of treatment and continued its
effect for 4 weeks [15]. Consistent with the literature, in
this study, itching and rash complaints decreased after
on average 1.2 injections in patients with CU and 1.1 injections in patients with AD. It is recommended that the
rate and pattern of healing during 1-3 and 3-6 months
of treatment with omalizumab be evaluated. If there is
no treatment response in the first 3 months, the diagnosis should be reconsidered and the treatment should be
continued if there is a partial response [6].

It has been reported in one study that omalizumab
maintains its efficacy up to 3 years after the treatment
[16]. In this study, 26 (29.9%) patients were found to
have a remission in the follow-up of 6 months. LarenasLinnemann et al. reported that remission was observed
in about 20% of chronic spontaneous urticarial cases
without recurrence during the 1-year follow-up [16]. The
high rate of remission in our study may be related to the
short follow-up period. The remission was observed in
4 (40%) of 10 AD patients with a complete response. As
a result, it can be said that patients with AD with higher percentages of IgE and eosinophil respond better to
omalizumab treatment than patients with urticaria.

Immunoglobulin E plays an important role in the
pathogenesis of many allergic diseases. Omalizumab
has been shown to be effective in the treatment of allergic rhinitis, AD, physical urticaria, mast cell dysfunction,
food allergies and other allergic diseases [17]. The use of
omalizumab in AD was presented as case reports in the
literature. In this study, 10 cases with AD treated with
omalizumab treatment were evaluated. Therefore, we
think that the use of omalizumab in AD will contribute to
the literature. It has been reported that omalizumab reduces the severity of the disease and improve the quality
of life in the treatment of AD, especially when it is used
in conjunction with classical treatments [5]. In this study,
a complete response was achieved in 50% of cases and
remission was achieved in 40%.
t is known that omalizumab has been well tolerated
since 2005 in atopic asthma and since 2014 in CU treatment. Side effects such as headache, temporary hair loss
and increased blood sugar have been reported in the
case reports [18-20]. In this study, only one case developed tachycardia after the injection.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Conclusions

Omalizumab has become a preferred treatment for
chronic and itchy diseases such as urticaria and AD with

profile. The limitation of our studies is that patients are
not evaluated with a scoring such as urticaria activity
score and AD severity index and that information was
obtained from the file records. Patients with high IgE and
eosinophil percentages and a positive autologous serum
skin test had a better treatment response to omalizumab. Meanwhile, remission is found to be more frequent
in AD patients with omalizumab treatment compared to
the patients with urticaria. It may be more appropriate
to choose patients based on certain criteria to ensure
cost-effectiveness in omalizumab treatment.
