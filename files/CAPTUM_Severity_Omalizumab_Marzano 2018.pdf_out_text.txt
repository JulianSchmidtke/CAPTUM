Abstract

Background Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is defined as spontaneous occurrence of wheals and/or angioedema for
>6 weeks. Omalizumab is a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody effective in refractory CSU, but its mechanism of action and markers
predictive of response remain not completely defined.

Objectives To correlate baseline levels of two proposed biomarkers, total IgE (blgE) and p-dimer (bp-dimer), and clinical
parameters to omalizumab response and to relapses after drug withdrawal.

Methods In this retrospective Italian multicentre study, clinical data were collected in 470 CSU patients, and blgE and bpdimer were measured in 340 and 342 patients, respectively. Disease activity was determined by Urticaria Activity Score 7
(UAS7) at week 1 and 12 after omalizumab starting. Relapses were evaluated during a 2- and 3-month interval after a first and
a second course of treatment, respectively.

Results blgE correlated to a good response to omalizumab since levels were significantly higher in responders than nonresponders (P = 0.0002). Conversely, bp-dimer did not correlate to response. There was no correlation between both bigE and
p-dimer and either first or second relapse. Disease duration was significantly longer in patients who experienced either first or
second relapse (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0105, respectively), while baseline UAS7 correlated only to first relapse (P = 0.0023).
Conclusions Our study confirms bIgE as a reliable biomarker predicting response to omalizumab in CSU, while it does not
support the usefulness of bo-dimer unlike previous findings. CSU duration before omalizumab and baseline UAS7 may be clinical markers of relapse risk.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is defined as the spontaneous occurrence of wheals and/or angioedema for six or
more weeks.! All over the world, more than 50 million people are affected by CSU, a disease which exerts negative
effects on different aspects of the quality of life, such as sleep,
school and work performance, daily life activities and social
relationships.** Physiopathology of CSU has not been completely elucidated, but the role of histamine as well as several
other proinflammatory cytokines released by skin mast cells
and basophils in wheal formation is undisputed. However,
different biologic systems, that is autoimmunity, coagulation
and autoallergy, may contribute in determining CSU symptoms.* The autoimmune pathomechanism is based on the
presence of circulating histamine-releasing immunoglobul
(Ig) G autoantibodies directed against either the high-affinity

 

in

IgE receptor (FceRI) on mast cells and basophils or membrane-bound IgE.°* The coagulation cascade is activated in
CSU and involves mainly the so-called extrinsic pathway,
which is mediated by the overexpression of tissue factor on
activated eosinophils, as seen in the lesional skin of CSU
patients.” Moreover, thrombin, which is the final enzyme of
coagulation cascade, permeability and
induces mast cell degranulation in experimental models.'°!!
Thus, the activation of coagulation concurs to CSU patho
increases vascular

genesis and correlates to disease severity, as demonstrated by
the elevated levels of p-dimer, a biomarker of coagulation
activation and fibrinolysis, in the plasma of CSU patients.'*
4 Another mechanism recently identified and classified as
‘auto-allergic’ is mediated by IgE specific for different auto
allergens like thyroperoxidase (TPO),'° double-stranded
DNA!® and interleukin (IL)-24.!”
Omalizumab is a recombinant DNA-derived humanized

monoclonal anti-IgE antibody widely proved to be effective
and safe for the treatment of CSU."* Albeit its exact mechanism of action is not completely understood, the omal

Patients

In this retrospective multicentre study involving 12 different
Italian Dermatology and Allergology Units, we evaluated clinical
(sex, age at diagnosis, disease duration, disease activity at baseline assessed by means of UAS7) and laboratory (thyroi
autoimmunity, notably presence of autoantibodies directe:
against thyroglobulin or TPO) findings of 470 patients with
severe CSU.

To be part of this observational study, each centre was aske
to provide data for patients with refractory CSU, defined as having a history of spontaneous urticaria for more than 6 weeks.
We included only CSU patients resistant to standard first-line
treatments, that is all patients were refractory to standard dose
and up to fourfold dosed second-generation antihistamine

(sgAH) treatment, and all had a baseline UAS7 >16. Some
patients had treatments other than antihistamines before inclusion in this study.

Patients were treated with omalizumab 300 mg_ every
4 weeks for 24 weeks, and they were instructed to continue
their daily treatment with an up to fourfold dosed sgAH for
the first 4 weeks. According to the Italian Drug Agency
(AIFA) recommendations,”> omalizumab was discontinued
after 24 weeks (first course) and re-administered in case of
relapse of symptoms (UAS7 >16) for other 20 weeks (second
course). Patients were assessed for their clinical response at
the end of the first week and at week 12 after the start of
omalizumab treatment.

All patients agreed with the treatment regimen and signed
a written consent form. Control subjects provided written
consent to the use of their blood samples in an anonymous
form for research purposes. In view of the retrospective nature of the study, only a notification to the Ethical Committee of the principal investigator Center (IRCCS Fondazione
Ca’ Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy) was
requested.

Clinical response and relapses

Disease activity was determined by the use of UAS7, which is the
weekly sum score of the daily subscore values for number of
wheals (no wheals = 0 points; 1-20 wheals = 1 point; 21-50
wheals = 2 points; >50 wheals = 3 points) and intensity of itch
(no itch = 0 points; mild itch = 1 point; moderate itch = 2
points; severe itch = 3 points).*!

An early complete (EC) response was defined as the disappearance of the CSU symptoms (UAS7 of 0) within
1 week from the start of omalizumab treatment. A late complete (LC) response was defined as the disappearance of the
CSU symptoms (UAS7 of 0) within 12 weeks from the start
of omalizumab treatment. A late partial (LP) response was
defined as an at least 30% reduction of UAS7 as compared
to baseline evaluated at week 12 while no response (N) was
defined as a <30% reduction of UAS7 or an exacerbation at
week 12.

Two relapses were evaluated: the first one, defined as first
relapse, during the 2 months following omalizumab withdrawal
after the first course of treatment and the second one, defined as
second relapse, during a period of 3 months following omalizumab withdrawal after the second course of treatment
(see above). The relapse was considered to be the reappearance
of CSU symptoms in complete responders and the increase in
UAS7 as compared to the value at the end of omalizumab
treatment in partial responders.

Laboratory data

Serum bIgE was measured by chemiluminescent immunoassay
(ImmunoCAP; ThermoFisher Scientific, Uppsala, Sweden), and

JEADV 2018

levels of 100 KUA/L or greater were defined as increased based
on the reference range of the laboratory of the principal investigator Center.

Sodium citrate-anticoagulated plasma bp-dimer was measured by immunoenzymatic methods (Zymutest p-Dimer;
Hyphen BioMed, Neuville-sur-Oise, France) in accordance with
the manufacturer’s instructions. The intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were 10% and 15%, respectively. Levels below
500 ng/mL were regarded as normal.

Statistical analysis

Continuous variables are reported as mean (standard deviation,
SD) or median (interquartile range, IQR), as appropriate. Categorical data are reported as counts (percentages). Considering
clinical response and relapses, the Student’s two-sample t-test or
the Mann—Whitney non-parametric test was used for the comparisons of continuous variables between groups, as appropriate.
Fisher exact test was used for group comparison of categorical
variables. Kolmogorov—Smirnov test was used to assess if bIgE
and bp-dimer data were normally distributed. Since bIgE and
bp-dimer data were skewed, they were log-transformed before
performing the analyses. The results are reported as antilog values of means (geometric means) and standard deviations. For
comparisons of continuous variables (log-transformed bIgE)
among the four categories of clinical responders (EC, LC, LP
and N), a general linear model analysis was performed. Finally,
considering only the first relapse, a logistic regression analysis
was performed in order to provide a joint assessment of the
two variables that showed an association with the first relapse.
P values for pairwise comparisons between the four responder
categories were adjusted using Sidak’s adjustment method. P values lower than 0.05, two-sided, were considered statistically significant. All the statistical analyses were performed with the
statistical software SAS (release 9.4; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary,
North Carolina).

Results

Clinical features
Demographic and clinical features of the patients are summarized in Table 1.

The patients were predominantly females (n = 310; 66%).
The median age at the time of diagnosis was 49 years (IQR:
37-61 years). The median CSU duration, assessed as the time
from CSU diagnosis to omalizumab initiation in months, was of
20 months (IQR: 9-48 months). Positivity for antithyroglobulin
or anti-TPO autoantibodies was observed in 121 out of 438
patients (27.6%); in 32 patients, laboratory data were not available. A positive clinical response was recorded in 425 patients
(90.4%), whereas non-responders were 45 (9.6%). Stratifying
patients based on grade and rapidity of response, it was observed
that EC response was achieved by 211 patients (44.9%), LC

response by 119 patients (25.3%) and LP response by 95 patients
(20.2%). First relapse was observed in 236 out of 392 patients
(non-responders, cases lost to follow-up and patients under
treatment when data had been collected were excluded), with a
relapse rate of 60.2%. Second relapse was observed in 116 out of
175 patients, with a relapse rate of 66.3%. Complete responders

who had not experienced the first relapse were not further followed up for a possible relapse.

As shown in Table 2, sex, age at the diagnosis, disease duration and thyroid autoimmunity did not significantly differ
between responders and non-responders. Similarly, the risk of
developing the first and second relapse was not associated with
thyroid autoimmunity, sex and age (Table 3). Interestingly, disease duration was significantly longer in patients who experienced either first (median 13 months,
P< 0.0001) or second relapse (median duration 25 vs.
18 months, P = 0.0105) after omalizumab withdrawal. Furthermore, baseline UAS7 significantly correlated with the risk of
developing the first (P = 0.0023) but not the second relapse.

for the assessment of the joint association of disease duration
and UAS7 with the first relapse.

Laboratory data

bIgE was determined in 340 patients and bp-dimer in 342
patients of our cohort; both were measured in 272 cases. Interestingly, bIgE was associated with the clinical response to omalizumab as levels were significantly higher in responders (mean
value: 132 KUA/L) than in non-responders (mean value:
42 kUA/L; P = < 0.0001). Among responders, there was no significant difference in terms of clinical response among the three
categories, namely EC, LC and LP; indeed, as shown in Figure 1
and Table 5, all three categories of responders showed a statistical significance when compared with non-responders
(P = 0.0002 for EC; P = 0.0182 for LC; P = 0.0005 for LP). On
the other hand, there was no association between bIgE and either
first or second relapse (Table 3).

Of note, bp-dimer was not associated with the clinical
response to omalizumab since bp-dimer mean values were similar in responders and non-responders (Table 2). As in the case
of bIgE, there was no association between bp-dimer and either
first or second relapse (Table 3).

 

Discussion

This retrospective multicentre study on a cohort of 470 patients
with CSU reflects the Italian real-life experience in the management of the disease with omalizumab and confirms the efficacy
of this agent for ssAH-—refractory CSU. In fact, in line with most
studies present in the literature,** *° complete responders to
omalizumab were approximately 70% of the patients, with
around 65% who responded early, namely within the first week
after omalizumab starting, and around 35% who responded
more lately, namely at the clinical evaluation at week 12 after
omalizumab administration.

Although late responders to omalizumab are regarded as
patients who respond after 12 weeks of treatment,’ we
made our clinical evaluation at week 12 since AIFA recommendations for CSU establish that omalizumab has to be

Moreover, we evaluated relapses during the 2 months following omalizumab discontinuation after the first course of treatment (defined as first relapse) and during a period of 3 months
following omalizumab discontinuation after the second course
of treatment (defined as second relapse). In fact, according to
the AIFA recommendations for CSU,” omalizumab was withdrawn after 24 weeks and re-administered in case of relapse of
symptoms for other 20 weeks. Of note, the first relapse occurred
in approximately 60% of responders. The second relapse was

Figure 1 Correlation between baseline total IgE levels and clinical
response to omalizumab subdivided into four categories: early
complete (EC), defined as the disappearance of the chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) symptoms within 1 week from omalizumab
starting; late complete (LC), defined as the disappearance of the
CSU symptoms within 12 weeks from the start of omalizumab
treatment; late partial (LP), defined as an at least 30% reduction of
Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) as compared to baseline, evaluated
at week 12; and no response (N), defined as a <30% reduction of

was prevalent in non-responders and only rarely detectable in
complete responders, possibly representing a marker of lack of
response to the drug. On the other hand, they failed to identify a
cut-off for bIgE for non-responders, thus concluding that bIgE
cannot be regarded as a stand-alone predictor of response to
omalizumab.**

bIgE was also reported to correlate to the rapidity of relapse
upon omalizumab discontinuation,*® proposing blgE as a biomarker potentially helping also to predict fast CSU relapse and
to identify patients in whom the treatment has not to be
stopped, but we were unable to confirm this finding in the present study, although, notably, we found that disease duration
was significantly linked to odds of both first and second relapse.
Moreover, baseline UAS7 significantly correlated to the first but
not to the second relapse. The latter finding is in line with the
recent study of Ferrer et al.,*° who showed that high baseline
UAS7 and slow decrease in CSU symptoms after omalizumab
starting indicate a higher probability of rapid relapse upon drug
withdrawal.

In our study, we evaluated bp-dimer with the aim of confirming a possible role of this biomarker in predicting clinical
response to omalizumab and tendency to develop disease flareups. Our group recently suggested possible effects of omalizumab on the coagulation cascade and fibrin degradation leading to a marked reduction in p-dimer plasma levels in CSU
patients treated with this agent.?*?°“° In keeping with our previous findings, elevated bp-dimer levels were observed in CSU
patients responders to omalizumab in a recent French study,*'
which showed also a fast normalization of this biomarker during

omalizumab treatment. However, the latter study did not support the usefulness of p-dimer to monitor long-term disease
prognosis in adult CSU, indicating the need of further studies
on larger series of patients to clearly establish the link between
p-dimer and clinical response to omalizumab.

In this large cohort of Italian patients, we failed to confirm the results of our previous study which had revealed
that not only blgE but also bp-dimer was higher in responders than non-responders to omalizumab in CSU.?? In fact,
bp-dimer did not correlate neither to the clinical response
to omalizumab, since they were similar in responders and
non-responders, nor to probability to develop relapses. In
preliminary studies including a low number of CSU patients,
we reporte

 

that bp-dimer was higher in responders than in
non-responders to omalizumab and suggested that this marker of coagulation activation/fibrinolysis potentially
involved in the mechanism of action of omalizumab in CSU
and might be predictor of the therapeutic effectiveness of

‘was

this drug.??*° The present multicentre study on a larger series of patients with CSU failed to confirm the predictive
value of this biomarker, making reasonable to consider bpdimer as associated with CSU severity in a subset of CSU
patients, as previously reported,”!*'* rather than being a
marker of clinical response to omalizumab.

In conclusion, our study confirms the link between bIgE levels
and response to omalizumab treatment in CSU patients, pointing out bIgE as a predictor of response to omalizumab, while it
does not support the usefulness of bp-dimer. Interestingly, the
study shows also that the duration of the disease before omalizumab starting and high baseline UAS7 values may be clinical
markers of relapse risk.
