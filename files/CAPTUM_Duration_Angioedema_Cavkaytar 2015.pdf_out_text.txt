Abstract

Background:NSAIDs-exacerbated cutaneous disease is defined as the exacerbation of wheals and/or
angioedema in patients with a history of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). The objective of this
study was to define “aspirin hypersensitive” children and adolescents in a clearly defined group of

patients with CSU and to describe their clinical features.

Methods:Eighty-one children with an history of CSU were enrolled over a three year period. The
daily, or almost daily (>4 days a week) presence of urticaria was defined as “chronic persistent
urticaria” (CPU), while presence of urticaria for 2-4 days a week was defined as “chronic recurrent
urticaria” (CRU). Single blind placebo controlled provocation tests (SBPCPT)s with aspirin were

performed for children with CSU.

Results:Patients with CRU had a longer duration of cutaneous symptoms [1.6(0.5—4) vs. 0.6(0.3-1.5)
years] and stress was less frequently experienced as an eliciting factor in patients with CRU compared
to the patients with CPU (p<0.016, p=0.024, respectively). SBPCPTs with aspirin revealed that 14 of
58 patients (24%) with CPU, and one of 10 patients with CRU (10%), were aspirin hypersensitive.
Aspirin hypersensitivity rate was 26.5% in patients <12 years of age. All of the 15 aspirinhypersensitive patients (aged between 6.6-17.4 years), except for three, experienced an unequivocal

angioedema of the lips as a positive reaction in SBPCPT.

Conclusions:Nearly a quarter of children and adolescents with CSU were hypersensitive to aspirin.
For children with chronic urticaria determination of NSAID hypersensitivity in a well-controlled

clinical setting will help to avoid severe drug hypersensitivity reactions.

Key words: aspirin, chronic urticaria, drug allergy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug

Introduction

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) hypersensitivity is one of the leading causes of

morbidity both in hospitalized and ambulatory patients (1, 2). In the pediatric age group, the frequency

of hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs differs in particular study populations. It is estimated to be
0.3% in the general population (3), 0.55% in children with recurrent urticaria and angioedema (4), 4%
in children with asthma and allergic rhinitis (5) and 68.2% in children with a history of NSAID

hypersensitivity that were referred to a tertiary health center for allergic diseases (6).

NSAID hypersensitivity is classified as immunologically mediated (non-cross-reactive) or nonimmunologically mediated (cross-reactive). According to recent guidelines, NSAIDs exacerbated
cutaneous disease (NECD) is defined as a subgroup of non-immunologically mediated NSAID
hypersensitivity, which is used to describe the exacerbation of wheals and/or angioedema in patients
with a history of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) (7). Historically, aspirin (acetylsalycylic acid)
was the first NSAID introduced for its analgesic and antipyretic effects (8). A short while after its first
use, different types of hypersensitivity reactions to aspirin were described and, for decades, it was used
as a prototype of the other NSAIDs to define hypersensitivity reactions in separate clinical entities like
asthma and chronic urticaria (7). Aspirin hypersensitivity in adult patients with chronic urticaria has
been clearly defined for decades (9), with a frequency ranging between 20%—40% (10, 11). Generally,
wheals and/or angioedema become clear one to four hours after ingesting-aspirin and resolve within a
few hours or sometimes within a few days or even weeks. Additionally, the positive autologous serum
skin test (ASST) and the existence of concurrent angioedema are risk factors for prolonged and severe

CSU in this group of patients (12).

NSAIDs are widely used for their analgesic and antipyretic effects in both adults and children (13).
However, data regarding hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs in children is relatively scarce
compared to adults (6, 14). To our knowledge, the frequency of aspirin hypersensitivity in the
pediatric age group with CSU, as well as their clinical features, has not been reported until now. The
objective of this study was to define “aspirin hypersensitive” children and adolescents in a clearly

defined group of patients with CSU and to describe their clinical features.

Materials and Methods

Patients

Children who were referred to the Hacettepe University Pediatric Allergy outpatient clinic between
March 2011 and April 2014 with an history of spontaneous urticaria, with or without angioedema that
had been going on for at least six weeks and present at least two days a week with no underlying
eliciting factors such as parasites, food allergies, infectious agents, physical urticarias, autoimmune
diseases, or vasculitis were enrolled in the study. The daily, or almost daily (>4 days a week) (15, 16)
presence of urticaria was defined as “chronic persistent urticaria” (CPU), while the presence of
urticaria for 2-4 days a week was defined as “chronic recurrent urticaria” (CRU) (17). Among the
study participants, the ones who had an apparent exacerbation of urticarial plaques with or without
angioedema after the interruption of antihistamine intake were defined as “antihistamine dependent
severe urticaria” and were not able to be challenged with aspirin. The patients with an urticaria activity
score (UAS) (17, 18) (Table S1) equal to or less than two after a cessation of antihistamine intake for
at least eight days underwent a single blind, placebo controlled provocation test (SBPCPT) with
aspirin. The patients and the parents or caregivers were taught to calculate daily UAS values which
may range from 0 to 6 points, depending on the number of wheals (0-3 points) and the intensity of
pruritus (0-3 points) present daily for the seven days before the provocation date. If they had UAS
higher than two and needed to take antihistamines on at least one of the days in the previous week they
called and the date for provocation test was changed. If they didn’t have UAS higher than two they
were challenged on the planned day. None of the patients had a previous history of suspected allergic
reaction due to any NSAIDs or other drugs. The patients with CPU and CRU and with aspirin
hypersensitivity and tolerance were compared with each other according to age, gender, atopy,
concurrent angioedema, allergic disease (asthma and/or allergic rhinitis), familial history of allergic
disease and chronic or recurrent urticaria, presence of thyroid autoantibody (anti-thyroid peroxidase,
anti-thyroglobulin) and other autoantibodies (anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA),
autologous serum skin test (ASST) positivity and levels of total IgE, erythrocyte sedimentation rate

(ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocyte and thrombocyte counts, eosinophil number and

percentage. Additionally patients were classified according to the daily UAS at initial referral to our
unit as the patients with <2 points (mild urticaria) and the patients with >2 points (moderate to severe
urticaria). All the above mentioned clinical, demographical variables and laboratory values were
compared between the two groups. The follow-up time was defined as the follow-up period during
which patients-were regularly examined for ongoing symptoms in our department after aspirin
challenge. At the last follow-up visit, patients were asked if they had any exposure to any of the drugs
that may be cross-reactive to aspirin (8). Additionally, they were asked about the frequency of
appearance of residual urticarial plaques, which was defined as the ‘frequency of residual symptoms’.
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hacettepe University Medical Faculty, and
parents and children provided written informed consent. Details of the diagnosis of asthma and

allergic rhinitis are given in the ‘Supplementary Methods’ section.

Study measurements
Oral provocation test with aspirin

SBPCPT with aspirin was performed under medical supervision in a clinical setting and the patients
were observed for an additional six hours. Then, the patients were taught about the symptoms of
having a positive provocation test and admitted again in case of the occurrence of allergic symptoms
within 24 hours. The baseline forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV;) was measured by
spirometry for all the patients older than five years of age. On the first day of the challenge protocol,
four placebo capsules were administered at 1.5 hour intervals; additionally, FEV, was measured 30
minutes before and after each consecutive dose. If the patient had no exacerbation of cutaneous lesions
and stayed in a stable clinical condition, the challenge continued on the second day with the ingestion
of capsules containing aspirin in a single blind fashion. Aspirin was administered at four exponentially
increasing doses (27 mg, 44 mg, 117 mg, 312 mg) (19) until the cumulative dose of 10 mg/kg (the
usual pediatric dose for pain or fever) (20) or the maximum dose of 500 mg was reached. The oral
provocation test (OPT) was recorded as positive if one of the following clinical reactions took place

normal skin) ii) apparent angioedema (defined as swelling of the skin and/or external mucosa), iii) a
minimum 15% decrease in FEV, on spirometry and iv) extracutaneous symptoms and signs

(rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, conjunctivitis or bronchospasms).

In vivo and in vitro tests are detailed in the methods section of ‘Supporting Information’.

Statistical Analysis

All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 21 software program (SPSS, Inc.-Chicago, Illinois,
USA). Descriptive data for categorical variables was expressed as frequencies and numerical variables
as mean (+standard deviation) or median (interquartile range) according to normal or non-normal
distribution respectively. Group comparisons were constructed by using the ANOVA or KruskalWallis test for normally or non-normally distributed numerical variables respectively, and by the chi
square test or the Fisher test for categorical variables. A p value <0.05 was considered significant.

Results

A total of 81 children who exhibited CSU for at least six weeks, were included in the study over a
three year period. Sixty-eight (84%) of them experienced urticaria with or without angioedema almost
everyday of the week and were placed in the CPU group (Fig.1). The rest of the patients (16%) were
classified in the CRU group. The demographic, clinical and laboratory features of patients with either
CPU or CRU did not differ significantly, except for in the duration of urticaria before referral and
having-stress as an eliciting factor (Table 1). Patients with CRU had a longer duration of cutaneous
symptoms [1.6 (0.5—4)-years] compared to the patients with CPU [0.6 (0.3-1.5)-years] (p<0.016).
Stress was more frequently experienced as an eliciting factor of urticaria in patients with CPU

compared to patients with CRU (49.3% vs. 15.4%, p=0.024).

Furthermore when the patients were compared according to daily UAS their initial referral, the
duration of urticaria was shorter in patients with moderate to severe urticaria compared to the patients

with mild urticaria [0.5 (0.2-1) vs. 1 (0.4-2) years, respectively, (p=0.042, Table S2)].

According to the results of SBPCPT with aspirin, 14 of 58 patients (24%) with CPU, and one of 10
patients with CRU (10%), were defined as aspirin hypersensitive. None of the subjects reacted to the
placebo. Aspirin-hypersensitive and tolerant patients didn’t differ in terms of age, sex, accompanying
angioedema, atopy, asthma or allergic rhinitis, family history of urticaria or other allergic diseases and
ASST positivity (Table 2). Aspirin hypersensitive and tolerant patients were also similar in terms of
daily UAS at their initial referral, [2 (1-3) points for both groups, p>0.05]. Laboratory investigations
revealed that thrombocyte count was significantly higher in aspirin tolerant patients with CPU
(311000 +86230/mm*) compared to aspirin hypersensitive patients (256000 +55430/mm*) (p=0.012)
(Table 2). Patients with CPU were divided into two groups as patients >12 years of age or <12 years of
age. Aspirin hypersensitivity was found in nine of 34 patients <12 years of age with a frequency of
26.5%. Aspirin sensitive and tolerant patients didn’t differ in terms of demographic and clinical
features or-in their laboratory investigation results (Table S3, Table S4), except for the gender in

patients >12 years of age.

In total, there were 15 patients who were hypersensitive to aspirin with CSU; their clinical features are
summarized in Table 3. The age of aspirin-sensitive patients ranged between 6.6 and 17.4 years. The
maximum cumulative dose of aspirin was 10 mg/kg according to the challenge protocol. The smallest
dose that produced-a positive challenge was 1.5 mg/kg. Although none of the patients had angioedema
at the beginning of OPT all of the patients, except for three, experienced an unequivocal angioedema
of the lips as a positive reaction in OPT (Fig. 2). One of the patients experienced a 17% decrease in
FEV, with bilateral rhonchi upon physical examination during OPT, and improved after being

nebulized three times with salbutamol and a single 1 mg/kg dose of oral methylprednisolone

treatment. She was the only aspirin sensitive patient with a diagnosis of asthma. The other two patients

developed an unequivocal increase in the number of urticarial plaques during OPT.

The mean follow-up period of aspirin hypersensitive patients was 15.96 + 8.39 months. During this
period, we noticed that all the patients could safely use parasetamol when needed. Eleven patients
didn’t use another NSAID which was potentially cross-reactive to aspirin but three of them used
ibuprofen without any hypersensitivity reaction. At the end of the follow-up period, regarding the
residual cutaneous symptoms, three of the patients recovered from CSU in the last three months. Three
other were on daily antihistamine medication but their follow-up period was significantly shorter [2.4
months (+1.9)] than the other aspirin-hypersensitive patients [19 months (+5.2)], (p=0.009). Although
symptoms of chronic urticaria continued in the remaining nine patients, they reported that the severity

of urticaria decreased in time.

Discussion

In this study, for the first time, we described the prevalence of aspirin hypersensitivity in children and
adolescents with CSU who have no previous history of hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs.
Additionally, aspirin hypersensitivity was shown in pediatric patients with an intermittent (recurrent)
type of CSU (10%). It is important to note that NSAID hypersensitivity exists in patients with CSU

younger than 12 years of age.

The mechanism in NSAID exacerbated urticaria and/or angioedema in adult patients with CSU is
through inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1. The enhanced formation of leukotrienes is detected
not only during baseline assessment but also at the end of the aspirin provocation tests compared to
patients who are tolerant to aspirin (10) with a similar mechanism in aspirin exacerbated respiratory
disease (7). Severity and duration of cutaneous reactions during OPT correlate with the level of
urinary leukotrienes (10, 21). These patients can safely utilize COX-2 inhibitors (21) and montelukast,
which was found to be more efficient than daily 10 mg of cetirizine in a group of adult patients with

chronic urticaria and concurrent intolerance to aspirin and/or food additives (22). This supports the

pathophysiologic mechanism. There is a huge number of publications highlighting the underlying
mechanisms and describing the safe NSAIDs for adults with NSAID exacerbated chronic urticaria,
however the data about children is scarce. As an example; none of the adult patients with chronic
urticaria and concurrent aspirin hypersensitivity experienced allergic reactions following etoricoxib (a
selective COX-2 inhibitor) provocation (23). Similarly, in the study by Corzo et al., 100% of aspirinsensitive children aged 9-14 years regardless of having chronic urticaria were shown to use etoricoxib,
safely (24). The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms and the treatment modalities in children
with NSAID hypersensitivity and chronic urticaria will be shown in further studies. Additionally, the
findings of our study involving the epidemiologic data will most likely be an initiator for this field of

research in the pediatric age group.

Although there was a tendency for a higher frequency of allergic diseases, concurrent angioedema and
ASST positivity in aspirin sensitive patients, there were no significant differences between aspirin
sensitive and aspirin tolerant patients in relation to age, gender, atopy and family history of allergic
disease or autoantibody positivity. There are different findings in previous studies in relation to the
clinical features of NSAID sensitive and NSAID tolerant patients with chronic urticaria. The
prevalence of allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopy and total IgE levels was higher in a Korean adult
population of aspirin intolerant chronic urticaria patients compared to aspirin tolerant ones (25).
However, the frequency of autoantibody positivity, like anti-thyroglobulin, anti-microsomal and antinuclear antibody, was not different (26). Bae et al. reported that asthma, family history of allergic
diseases, nasal polyps (but not atopy) were associated with NSAID hypersensitivity (26). On the other
hand, atopy is frequently associated with NSAID hypersensitivity in children regardless of chronic
urticaria (6). Positivity of ASST was frequently detected in a subgroup of aspirin sensitive patients
with chronic urticarial (27). All these studies provided an excellent background for discovering the
link between-the genetic origin and the clinical entity of NECD (28), which is an unstudied area in

children with chronic urticaria.

One of the strengths of this study is the number of participants with a clearly defined diagnosis of CSU
in the pediatric age group. Chronic urticaria is generally an uncommon disease in children which
might affect up to 3% of a population according to epidemiologic studies (29). Its prevalence is rarer
in this age group compared to the prevelance in adults (30). The participants in this study were
prospectively assessed at their initial referral and only the ones with no underlying or comorbid known
etiology were included in the aspirin challenge. Although NECD is occasionally reported in adults
with physical urticarial (31), it is primarily defined in adults with CSU (7). In this study, we also

aimed to end up with a clearly defined study group of patients with CSU.

One of the interesting findings of this study is the apparent lip angioedema occurred as a result of the
OPTs in the majority of aspirin hypersensitive patients. Angioedema, particularly facial angioedema is
a distinctive feature of NSAID hypersensitivity in pediatric age group which is strongly emphasized in
previous studies both as a result of provocation tests and in the histories of the patients with the culprit
drugs (5, 6, 32, 33), besides according to our results occurrence of apparent lip angioedema as a result
of provocation tests with aspirin might be a distinctive feature of the patients with chronic urticaria in

this age group which should be proven in further studies.

In our study group, there were patients with severe urticaria, which is defined by an UAS higher than
two at the time of initial diagnosis. They were unable to be challenged because of the-dramatic
increase in their urticarial plaque when they stopped taking antihistamines. The sensitization rate for
aspirin would be higher if they could be challenged because the more active and severe the urticaria,
the more frequent the NSAID exacerbated cutaneous reactions (7, 15). The opposite is true for the
resolution of the symptoms. In adults, the frequency and intensity of the symptoms related with
chronic urticaria have been shown to decrease by time as well as the prevalence rates for aspirin
hypersensitivity (34). Since our patients with a longer duration of follow-up have urticaria and/or
angioedema with a lesser intensity compared to at the onset, at least some of the children and

adolescents in this group might have recovered from aspirin hypersensitivity.

Additionally, care should be taken with children with CSU and concurrent asthma during NSAID
provocation tests due to the possibility of the induction of bronchospasms. Asthma exists more
frequently in adult patients with chronic urticaria and concurrent NSAID hypersensitivity compared to
NSAID tolerant ones (35). Furthermore, the decrease in FEV, may precede the development of
cutaneous reactions even in chronic urticaria patients with no history of asthma (10). Therefore, a
close spirometry follow-up by during the provocation test is an easy and effective way to recognize

aspirin hypersensitivity early.

In NECD inhibition of COX-1 results in a cross-reactive type of hypersensitivity, which means that
urticaria can be exacerbated by various NSAIDs, other than aspirin, that inhibit COX-1. In this study,
we aimed to identify the aspirin sensitive patients in a group of pediatric patients with chronic
urticaria, which was a proven clinical entity in adult patients. We were sure that each patient utilized
parasetamol which is a weak inhibitor of COX-1 and COX-2 at high doses (8) and was shown to be
safe in aspirin-sensitive children (6, 24) at the daily recommended doses. Therefore, we didn’t perform
OPT with any other NSAIDs. Additionally ibuprofen tolerance in three of aspirin hypersensitive
patients might be a controversy to the cross-reactive nature of NECD. However the three aspirin
reactors who used ibuprofen safely in the follow-up had an extended period of follow-up (nearly two
years) and during this time the severity and frequency of their chronic urticaria had been subsided

which might explain this controversy (34).

One can think that the maximum dose of aspirin, 500 mg, maybe insufficient for inducing a positive
provocation test in some of the study participants, which may be accepted as a limitation of the study,
however, we used the recommended dosing profile used in previous studies to show aspirin
hypersensitivity in adult patients with CSU (10, 15, 21). According to EAACI/GALEN guidelines, an
additional dose of 500 mg of aspirin is recommended for adults with a history of suspicious
hypersensitivity reaction to NSAIDs if no reaction was elicited during OPT at the end of the initial

cumulative dose of 500 mg (19). However, none of our patients had a previous suspected reaction

history to NSAIDs. Therefore, we preferred to use 500 mg as the maximum cumulative provocative

dose.

In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that a nonnegligible portion of children and
adolescents with CSU have hypersensitivity to aspirin. Additionally, care should be taken with
children with CSU and concurrent asthma during NSAID provocation tests due to the possibility of the
induction of bronchospasms. For children with chronic urticaria determination of NSAID
hypersensitivity in a well-controlled clinical setting will help avoid severe drug hypersensitivity

reactions.
