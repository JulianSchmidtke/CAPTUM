ABSTRACT. In Italy, only one study was conducted on the
detection of serum thyroid autoantibodies (ATA) in patients
with urticaria. This northern-Italy study reported a 23% rate
of ATA positiveness in 52 patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU). During the years 1998-2006, 688 patients with
urticaria were hospitalized at our Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Thyroglobulin and thyroperoxidase autoantibodies (TgAb and TPOAb) were assayed at admission
in 144/688 patients. Of the 144 patients (mean age:
42.3+15.8 yr, range 17-84), 95 (72 women and 23 men) had
an history of CIU (CIU group) and 49 (44 women and 5 men)
did not [acute urticaria group or (AU)]. Of the 144 patients,
37 (25.7%) tested positive for at least one ATA: 31 with CIU
(32.6%) and 6 with AU (12.2%, ¥2=7.037, p=0.008). Posi
INTRODUCTION

Chronic urticaria (CU) is the daily or almost daily occurrence of wheals for at least 6 weeks; CU is defined idiopathic (CIU) when signs of vasculitis are absent, and no
causative drugs, foods or physical factors can be identified (1, 2). In 10 to 40% of CIU patients antibodies against
the high affinity receptor for IgE (anti-Fc,Rl,, Ab) have
been detected (3). The association between CIU and
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) was first described in 1983
(4). In 17 of 140 consecutive cases of CIU (12.1%), Leznoff
et al. (4) showed biochemical evidence of thyroid autoimmunity based on serum titers of thyroid microsomal
autoantibodies (TMAb) =1:1600. This rate was 2-fold
greater than the 5.6% rate found in 477 controls (4). In a
subsequent study on 624 patients with CIU and angioedema, the rate of positiveness for TMAb and/or thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TgAb) was 14.4% (5). The
mechanism for the association between CIU and thyroid
autoimmunity remains unclear (3). It has been hypothesized that a cross-linking of the mast cell IgE receptors
induced by thyroid autoantibodies (ATA) might cause
mast cells to release histamine (3).

Here we report the magnitude of the association between CIU and thyroid autoimmunity in consecutive patients hospitalized for CIU at the local University hospital, and the relationship between this association and a
number of variables.

tiveness for TROAb or TgAb was 30/37 (81.1%) or 17/37
(45.9%); 10/37 (27.0%). Pre-hospitalization duration of CIU
was longer in the 31 ATA positive patients compared to the
64 ATA negative patients (207.2+273.4 vs 81.6+106.3
weeks, p=0.015). Pre-hospitalization duration of CIU correlated positively with the log10-trasformed serum concentration of TPOAb in the 25 CIU patients who tested TPOAb positive (r=0.42, p=0.039). We conclude that our rate of 31/95
(32.6%) positiveness for at least one type of ATA in CIU is
greater than that of 6 representative international studies
published between the years 2000 and 2006 (111/488 or
22.7%, range 15-29%, ¥2=4.884, p=0.027).

TgAb and thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAb) (the latter previously known as TMAb). In the remaining 554 patients, this
screening was omitted because they had been treated with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants for at least the last
4 weeks before hospitalization.

Materials

Serum levels of TgAb (normal value 0-100 U/ml) and TROAb
(normal value 0-10 U/ml) were measured with the corresponding
immunoradiometric kits by DiaSorin (Saluggia, Italy).

Statistics

Data are reported as mean+SD. Differences between means
were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test, while differences between categorical groups were analyzed by the chi square (x2)
test. Correlation between 2 variables was evaluated with the linear regression analysis.

In all statistical analyses the level of significance was set at p=0.05.

RESULTS

Of the 144 patients eligible for the ATA screening, only
17 (11.8%) mentioned that they were aware of thyroid
disease, which consisted of uninodular or multinodular
goiter; all 17 turned out to be negative for both ATA.
Of these 144 patients, 95 (72 women and 23 men) had
a history of CIU as defined in the Introduction and 49
did not (44 women and 5 men) (Fig. 1). Hence, these 95
and 49 patients will be referred to as the CIU and the
acute urticaria (AU) group, respectively. The female:male
(F:M) ratio in the 95 patients with CIU differed from the
F:M ratio in the 49 patients with AU (3:1 vs 9:1, 72=4.05,
p=0.044), while age did not (p=0.084). Of the 144 patients, 37 (25.7%) tested positive for at least one ATA;
accordingly, they will be referred to as the ATA +ve
group (Fig. 2). The F:M ratio of this group (18:1) differed
significantly from that of the 107 patients who tested
negative for both ATA (3:1, y2=6.27, p=0.012); these
107 patients will be referred to as the ATA -ve group.

 

108

Of the 95 CIU patients, 31 (32.6%) tested positive for at
least one ATA, which is greater than the 6/49 rate (12.2%)
in the AU group (x2=7.037, p=0.008). The pattern of the
ATA positiveness is shown in Figure 2, and there were
no significant differences between the CIU group and the
AU group. Of the 37 patients ATA +ve, 31 (83.8%) had
CIU and 6 (16.2%) had AU. This is a statistically different
distribution compared to that of the 107 patients ATA
-ve, in whom 64 (59.8%) had CIU and 43 (40.2%) did not
(y2=7.037, p=0.008).

Duration of CIU before hospitalization, that is from the
onset through the day before hospitalization, was significantly longer in the 31 ATA +ve patients compared to
the 64 ATA -ve patients (Fig. 3), and the longest duration occurred in the subgroup with both TgAb and
TPOAb positive (Fig. 4).

There was a significantly positive linear relationship between duration of CIU and log10-transformed TPOAb
levels in the 25 CIU patients who tested positive for at
least TPOAb (Fig. 5). This relationship was absent in patients TgAb t+ve (r=0.15, p=0.683).

DISCUSSION

Our rate of 31/95 (33%) positiveness for at least one type
of thyroid autoantibody in CIU is greater than that of recent literature, as exemplified below. In a Turkish study
on 140 patients the rate of positiveness for TgAb and/or
TPOAb was 28.5% (6). In a Portuguese study positiveness for TgAb and/or TPOAb was 28.5% (7). In a French
study on 45 patients the rate of positiveness for TgAb
and/or TPOAb and/or TSH receptor Ab (TSH-RAb) was
12/45 (27%) (8). In a study conducted in Bologna, Italy,
the rate of positiveness for at least one ATA among
TgAb, TPOAb, and TSH-RAb was 12/52 (23%) in the CIU
group, not statistically different from the 23/70 rate (33%)
in the group of CU of known cause (9). In a Californian
study that measured only TPOAb in 25 patients with subacute or chronic idiopathic urticaria, the rate of TRPOAb
positiveness was 20% (10). In a Spanish study the rate of
positiveness for either TgAb and/or TPOAb was 25/170
(15%) (11). Thus, the weighted average rate of ATA positiveness from these 6 studies (6-11) is 22.7%, which is
significantly lower than our rate of 32.6% (31/95 vs
111/488, y2=4.218, p=0.040). It is worth noting that from
1998-2005, which essentially coincides with the 19982006 period when the series of consecutive patients with
idiopathic urticaria reported here was collected, at the
Division of Endocrinology of our University Hospital there
was an increment in the annual number of new patients
with a diagnosis of HT compared with previous years
(mid-'70s through mid-’90s) (12).

Furthermore, we compared our rate of ATA positiveness
with 100 age- and sex-matched blood donors to verify
whether the higher incidence of ATA in patients with CIU

is real or related to higher incidence in general population. In these blood donors the rate of ATA positiveness
was 13%, which is significantly lower than our rate of
32.6% (13/100 vs 31/95, ¥2=10.746, p=0.001).

If, based on budget reasons, the choice is between
TPOAb and TgAb, the former is superior because TPOAb
+ve would detect almost two times more ATA +ve patients (30/144 vs 17/144, y2=4.297, p=0.038). Also in the
subset of patients with CIU, the single approach based on
TPOAb testing only would detect twice as many ATA +ve
patients compared to TgAb testing only (25/95 or 26% vs
13/95 or 14%, ¥2=4.737, p=0.029).

In our series of patients we have reported a number of
correlations which, to our knowledge, have not been reported in the literature. Among patients with urticaria,
positiveness for at least one ATA is 3 times more frequent in those with a history of CIU than in those with

out (33% vs 12%). ATA positiveness at hospitalization
correlated with a longer time from the onset of urticaria.
Indeed, the duration of CIU before hospitalization was
2.5-fold longer in patients who tested ATA +ve at hospitalization compared to patients who tested ATA -ve
at hospitalization. This ATA effect on duration was due
to TPOAb, because in CIU patients with positiveness for
TPOAb only duration was 2.5-fold longer than in CIU patients with positiveness of TgAb only. Furthermore, the
longer the duration of CIU, the greater the concentration of serum TPOAb, a correlation that was absent for
TgAb. These data warrant a prospective study to verify
whether the initial measurement of TPOAb during the
first episode of urticaria and/or the trend of TROAb concentrations over a follow-up period is/are predictive of
the duration of CIU.

We conclude that our rate of positiveness for at least one
type of ATA in CIU (one-third) is greater than that of representative international studies published between the
years 2000 and 2006 (one-fifth to one-fourth). Patients
(women much more than men) with a history of CIU and
a long duration of CIU are those more likely to test
ATA+ve (particularly TROAb +ve) at hospitalization.
Prospective studies are needed to evaluate how ATA
positiveness translates into a clinical problem over time,
that is how many ATA+ve patients with urticaria will develop a clinically significant thyroid autoimmune disease
(HT, Graves’ disease) and how fast this clinical conversion takes place.
