Omalizumab: what benefits should we expect?

Background: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a skin disease
characterised by wheal appearance, swelling, itching, and painful skin.
Omalizumab has been used for CSU treatment demonstrating good efficacy. Objectives: To investigate the efficacy and safety of omalizumab
treatment in CSU patients in real-life practice. Materials & methods:
A retrospective analysis was performed on 38 patients suffering from
CSU who received 300 mg of omalizumab every four weeks. Results:
After omalizumab treatment, 68.4% of patients showed a complete response (UAS7 = 0). All the patients were able to stop treatment with
corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and anti-leukotrienes, and only 39.5% of
patients remained on anti-histamines. Omalizumab treatment led to a
96% and 65% decrease in emergency room and primary health care
visits, respectively, as well as a reduction in the direct costs associated
with the disease. No omalizumab-related adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Omalizumab exhibits good efficacy in alleviating the
symptoms of CSU, leads to a decrease in concomitant medication use,
restores patients’ quality of life, and has economic benefits by reducing
disease-related health care costs.

troubling skin disease [1, 2]. The global prevalence

of chronic urticaria is 1% of the world population
and up to two thirds of these patients suffer from CSU [3, 4].
It is twice as common in women than men [4].
CSU symptoms include oedematous-type skin reactions,
pruritus [1, 2, 4], and, in 40% to 50% of people suffering
from CSU, angioedema [5]. Symptoms appear spontaneously without any specific external cause [4, 6]. Research
on the underlying aetiology of CSU has highlighted the role
of autoimmunity. Moreover, some foods or infections have
been implicated, and other factors such as stress, fatigue,
and drugs are well recognized as aggravating factors
2].
CSU can significantly affect the quality of life (QoL) [6] of
patients, leading to negative effects, such as insomnia and
psychological comorbidities (e.g. depression or anxiety)
4]. Patients also experience difficulties at work and more
than half loose at least one day of work per month due
to urticaria [6]. Up to now, CSU treatment includes licensed doses of non-sedating antihistamines, with increasing
off-label dosing up to four-fold as a second-line step. Thirdline treatment includes systemic corticosteroids (only short
courses for acute exacerbations), cyclosporine [5, 7, 8],
omalizumab [8], or anti-leukotrienes [8]. Omalizumab has
been used for treatment of chronic urticaria demonstrating
good efficacy in alleviating the symptoms of the disease
[9-13]. In February 2014, its use was approved for CSU in
Europe.
In the present study, we collected data on the efficacy and
safety of omalizumab treatment in 38 CSU patients from

C hronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a serious and

 

five hospitals representing real-life practice. The benefits of
omalizumab over current available treatments for CSU are
discussed.

Methods

A retrospective descriptive analysis was carried out for 38
patients, from five hospitals, suffering from active CSU
which was refractory to: high doses of H1 antihistamines
(n = 38), third-line treatment according to the EACCI
guidelines (cyclosporine: n = 3; montelukast: n = 3; corticosteroids: n = 2), and other therapeutic options (doxepine:
n= 5; dapsone, n = 1) [8]. The mean weekly Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7), in spite of the treatment, showed severe
urticaria activity (mean UAS7 = 29.1 + SD [standard deviation] 7.68). Omalizumab was prescribed at the time as an
off-label treatment.

Patients were treated from January 2010 to January 2015.
CSU was defined based on the symptoms mentioned above.
As shown in table 1, the extended exploratory study
commonly performed included analysis of: blood count,
erythrocyte sedimentation rate, biochemistry, total IgE, and
complete thyroid function (TSH, T3, T4, anti-TPO, and
anti-thyroglobulin), as well as allergy skin tests to rule out
type I allergy, the Autologous Serum Skin Test (ASST),
and the Autologous Plasma Skin Test (APST). Occasionally, a lesional skin biopsy, an investigation for infection,
or an assessment of autoantibodies (e.g. antinuclear) was
performed.

“The sum is over 100% because some patients underwent more than one
diagnostic test.

All patients were treated with 300 mg omalizumab subcutaneously every four weeks. Omalizumab was used for
all patients as an off-label treatment, as approved by the
Spanish Agency for Drugs and Health Products, as well as
each respective hospital committee, which included written
consent.

The main outcomes documented in order to analyse
response to omalizumab treatment (improvement of symptoms) were:

(1) UAS7, which can vary from 0 to 42 per week.

(2) The Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire
(CU-Q2oL); a scale of life quality with 23 items grouped
into six categories associated with the disease: itching (two
questions), swelling (two questions), activities (six questions), sleep (five questions), limitations (three questions),
and appearance (five questions). Each item of the CU-Q20L
score ranges from 0 to 4; a high score is indicative of a poor
QoL [14].

(3) Frequency of adverse and serious adverse events (safety
events), and the relationship of these with the study drug.
We defined a complete response as a UAS7 score equal to
0[7, 15], a significant response as a UAS7 score of >0 and
<6, and a partial response as reduction in symptoms by
more than 30% but a UAS7 score >6. We defined exacerbations as flares of urticaria in which red and/or itchy hives
appeared on the skin. Patients were examined for the above
prior to omalizumab treatment and during the last visit in
which omalizumab was administered.

In order to assess additional benefits of omalizumab over
current available treatments for CSU, an evaluation of

EJD, vol. 26, n° 4, July-August 2016

impairment of patient QoL and health resources consumed
was conducted.

The categorical variables were described as absolute and
relative frequencies, whereas the continuous variables were
reported as the mean (+ SD) and/or median (plus range).
Descriptive statistics were performed using SAS software
version 9.4 for Windows (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC,
USA). Values of p>0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.

 

Results

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the
sample (38 patients) are summarised in table J. For the
overall population, the mean (+ SD) age was 48.1+13.96
years; women comprised 65.8% of the patients. The median
period of time (Q1, Q3; interquartile range) from diagnosis
was 4.0 (1.2, 8.0) years, and the median time from onset
of symptoms was 5.0 (3.0, 9.0) years. The main diagnostic tests performed for CSU diagnosis were: blood tests (33
patients; 86.8%), allergy skin tests (12 patients; 31.6%), and
the autologous serum skin test (ASST)/autologous plasma
skin test (APST) (nine patients; 23.7%), as well as analysis of IgE (nine patients; 23.7%) and TSH (seven patients;
18.4%). The median period of time (Q1, Q3) from onset of
omalizumab treatment was 6.5 (2.0, 24.0) months (table /).
Prior to the start of omalizumab treatment, the entire
population (100.0%) was on antihistamines (68.4% on nonsedative antihistamines, 31.6% on sedative antihistamines,
and 18.4% on non-specified antihistamines), 78.9% were
on corticosteroids, 39.5% were on cyclosporine, and 26.3%
were on antileukotrienes (table 2). Once treatment with
omalizumab was started, only 39.5% of patients were on
antihistamines and none of them were treated with either
corticosteroids, cyclosporine, or anti-leukotrienes (table 2).
There was a significant improvement in the UAS7 after
treatment with omalizumab. The median (Q1, Q3) UAS7
was 28.0 (22.0, 35.0) and 0.0 (0.0, 2.0) before and after
omalizumab therapy, respectively (table 2). Before omalizumab treatment, 92.1% of the patients (all the subjects who
were evaluated for UAS7 pre-treatment) showed a UAS7
score greater than 6, whereas after treatment with the drug,
68.4% had a UAS7 score of 0 and 23.7% a UAS score lower
than 6 but higher than 0. Only three patients (7.9%) remained with a UAS7 score above 6 but lower than 13 (table 2).
Moreover, during the treatment with omalizumab, there was
a decrease in the number of patients suffering from exacerbations (from 89.5% to 13.2%) and angioedema (from
39.5% to 5.3%). The duration of omalizumab treatment
was variable, ranging from two months (two patients) to
27 months (one patient), and all the patients had ongoing
treatment when data were collected for analysis.

The only adverse effect reported by a patient consisted
of non-specific discomfort and was not attributed to drug
administration.

Finally, the use of resources (emergency room [ER] and
primary health care visits) and time off work due to sick
leave decreased after omalizumab treatment (table 2). The
number of patients visiting the ER was 27 (71.1%) and 1
(2.6%) before and after omalizumab treatment, respectively. Twenty-three (60.5%) patients visited primary health
care centres before treatment with omalizumab versus 8

Accordingly, both the median (Q1, Q3) direct costs of

on nine patients. The QoL test showed a statistically
significant increase in QoL after treatment with omalizumab (mean [SD] of 72.7 [18.89] pre-omalizumab
versus 12.8 [10.34] post-omalizumab _ treatment)
(table 2).

Discussion

The standard treatment for chronic spontaneous urticaria, as
recommended by guidelines, is non-sedating anti-H1 antihistamines as first-line therapy, with an increase in off-label
dose up to fourfold as a second-step, and systemic corticoids
for acute exacerbations and cyclosporine, omalizumab, and
anti-leukotrienes as third-line treatment [5, 7, 8]. In addition to guidelines [8] that recommend omalizumab for CSU
treatment, there are several studies that have shown omalizumab therapy to be an effective treatment option for
patients with CSU [12, 16-18].

342

We present descriptive retrospective data from patients
suffering CSU who were treated with omalizumab. A
limitation of this study is the retrospective design, in
which omalizumab was administered at a dose of 300 mg
every four weeks, as off-label treatment in a real-life
practice. Another limitation of the present study is the
small sample size (n = 38), although it is noteworthy
that even with the small size, the results are statistically
significant. Moreover, the results are consistent with previous published results of 110 omalizumab-treated patients
[19].

Omalizumab administered at 300 mg every four weeks
alleviated CSU symptoms (the number of angioedemas)
and allowed concomitant medication use to be lowered. After treatment with omalizumab, a higher rate of
angioedema-free patients was observed (table 2). In addition, after omalizumab treatment, only 15 patients were
treated with concomitant medications (anti-histamines)
versus all patients (n = 38) treated with anti-histamines
before treatment; the majority of the latter were receiving
other therapies (e.g. corticosteroids, cyclosporine, or antileukotrienes) before treatment with omalizumab. In support
of the improvement in CSU, we found that omalizumab
treatment significantly reduced the UAS7 score. Of all
the 38 patients, 35 subjects had a pre-omalizumab UAS7
score which was greater than 6 in 100% of the subjects,

whereas after treatment 92.1 % of the patients had a UAS7
score <6 (26 patients [68.4%] presented a complete response [UAS7 = 0]) (table 2). Only three patients showed a
partial response with a UAS7 score of >6 [8-12] due to a
slower response and the concomitant involvement of known
exacerbating factors, e.g. NSAIDs. Along the same lines,
previous studies have shown an improvement in the UAS7
score. The majority of patients (52% [20, 21], and 66%
[11] after treatment with 300 mg of omalizumab showed
a UAS7 score of <6.

Previous studies have shown a significant association between omalizumab treatment and a reduction in the number
of exacerbations, ER visits, corticoid use, and an improvement in patients’ QoL [22, 23]. Our findings are in line
with these previous studies. The number of patients visiting
the ER and primary health care centres clearly decreased after treatment with omalizumab, as well as all the
direct costs involved (table 2). Moreover, all concomitant
medication decreased and QoL improved (table 2). Regarding the QoL, although this was only evaluated in nine
patients in the sample, the CU-Q2oL test performed to
assess the QoL showed a statistically significant improvement after treatment with omalizumab. The results of
these nine patients demonstrate the importance of these
tests to reflect the improvement in QoL, as well as improvement with regards to the symptoms (e.g. UAS7) of the
disease.

Regarding omalizumab safety, only one patient suffered
an adverse event but this was considered not to be related to the drug. Overall, the safety profile of the present
study matches with previously reported good safety profiles
[10, 11, 20, 21]. All studies showed a similar incidence of
adverse events between both groups (omalizumab vs placebo), with no trends or clinical difference resulting from
or associated with omalizumab.

In conclusion, we present data of 38 patients suffering
from CSU who received 300 mg of omalizumab every four
weeks. In this study, 68.4% of patients showed a complete
response (UAS7 = 0) after omalizumab treatment and all
the patients were able to stop corticosteroids, cyclosporine,
and anti-leukotrienes. Thus, omalizumab demonstrated
significant effectiveness and a safe profile which markedly alleviated disease symptoms, decreasing concomitant
medications and restoring patient QoL. Finally, omalizumab offers benefits in reducing the economic impact and
costs of disease treatment by decreasing ER and primary
health care visits, as well as time taken off work due to
sick leave. All the results presented in this study support
and confirm the recommendation made by the EAACI and
WAO guidelines [5, 7, 8] in which omalizumab is included
for the treatment of CSU as third-line therapy. Nevertheless,
urther research is required in order to compare between
omalizumab and other treatments for CSU, to determine its
place in CSU therapy.
