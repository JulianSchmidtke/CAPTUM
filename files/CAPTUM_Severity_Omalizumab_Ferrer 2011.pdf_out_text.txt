grass pollen allergens. These findings suggest but do not prove
that use of higher allergen doses of standardized therapeutic
house dust mite extracts could be associated with greater risk of
grade 3 SRs. These findings may be consistent with a recent
retrospective national survey reporting that the majority of serious
near-fatal and fatal SCIT reactions occurred with higher-dose
injections from maintenance vials rather than build-up vials.*>
There are little if any dose-response data from which to infer
the optimally safe dosages of standardized aqueous extracts as
has been achieved for certain formulations of sublingual immunotherapy currently being investigated. Thus, larger clinical outcome studies may be required in the future to determine the
optimal therapeutic window for various standardized aqueous
allergen products.

The only other significant findings differentiating the 2 groups
were that clinics reporting grade 3 SRs were more likely than
those reporting grade 1 SRs to implement safety measures
including obtaining patient identifiers before injections, pretreating with antiallergic drugs, and prescribing epinephrine for highrisk patients (eg, all patients with asthma) or even for all patients
receiving SCIT. It is quite possible that those clinicians observing
grade 3 events may have adapted new standards for prescribing
self-administered epinephrine as a direct result of concerns about
late-onset SRs beginning after the customary 30-minute postinjection observation period. Indeed, in year 2 of this annual
surveillance study,° we learned that 14% of SRs started 30 minutes after SCIT injections, although only 3% of these were severe
grade 3 SRs. Although the most recent update of the Allergen Immunotherapy Practice Parameters found insufficient evidence to
support the routine prescription of emergency epinephrine kits
to all patients receiving SCIT, it is clear that more clinical data
are needed to determine the impact of this practice on clinical outcomes.’ Finally, it is possible that other clinical practices not
addressed in this retrospective survey (eg, use of cluster or rush
SCIT protocols) could also predict risk of severe SRs.

Omalizumab is effective in nonautoimmune

urticaria

To the Editor:

We performed an open prospective observational study to
assess whether omalizumab is effective treatment of patients with
nonautoimmune chronic urticaria who are unresponsive to antihistamines, and in some instances, unresponsive to low-dose
corticosteroid and/or cyclosporine. We included the first 9
consecutive patients with severe nonautoimmune chronic urticaria who fulfilled the aforementioned criteria. The patients were
designated “nonautoimmune” by measuring histamine release
(1.22; interquartile range [IR] 0-9.9), and CD63 expression (0.62;
IR 0-4.4) on incubation of patients’ sera with donor basophils, and
all subjects were negative.

To assess basophil responsiveness to anti-IgE for the histamine
release, we incubated isolated leukocytes with goat antihuman
IgE (Tago; Caltag, Burlingame, Calif), and for the CD63 expression, with monoclonal anti-FceRI (1 jg/mL; BUHLMANN,
Schénenbuch, Switzerland) and assayed histamine release and
CD63 expression as previously described.'* Basophil number
was counted by flow cytometry using dual staining with rat
anti-IgE—fluorescein isothiocyanate (Caltag, Buckingham,
United Kingdom) and CD63-phycoerythrin (BD Biosciences,
San Diego, Calif). We designated basopenia to be present with
a count of less than 50 basophils analyzed in 3 minutes by
FACS Diva Software in a FACS Canto Cytometre (BD Biosciences). We measured antithyroid antibodies in all patients except
patient 7, and all were negative for antithyroglobulin and antimicrosomal antibodies. We determined antinuclear antibodies in 3
of these patients; 2 were negative, and | (patient 3) was positive.

We obtained permission for the compassionate use of
omalizumab from the National Ministry of Health as well as
informed consent from each patient. We administered 300 mg
omalizumab subcutaneously to all patients, regardless of the total
IgE level.

We administered monthly doses to 5 patients, a dose every 3
months to 3 patients, and a bimonthly dose to | patient. The
patient demographics are summarized in Table I. We used the
“urticaria activity score’*> to evaluate urticaria severity and
symptom improvement (Table II). There were no dropouts.

For statistical analysis, we pooled the medications by therapeutic dose intervals—that is, the sum of the number of tablets of
antihistamines, montelukast, and cyclosporine taken and total
milligrams taken for corticosteroids. Patients were allowed to
take medication as needed, and the number of pills or milligrams
of corticosteroids per day was recorded. These data do not
correspond to a normal distribution; thus, values are expressed as
medians and interquartile ranks. We used the Mann-Whitney
U test to compare nonnormally distributed quantitative values and
the Fisher exact test or the y° test for qualitative variable

13.0 was used.

Patients 2 and 4 (Table I) achieved a complete remission after
1 and 2 doses of omalizumab, respectively; patient 2 remained
asymptomatic for 2 years and patient 4 for 18 months. Two patients were free of symptoms between doses, meaning that we
continued omalizumab on a regular basis and did not wait for
hives to reappear. Five patients typically had a few hives or
mild pruritus just before the next dose.

We found significant Urticaria Activity Score (UAS) among
pretreatment and second, third, and fourth doses. Both variables—
that is, pruritus and number of urticarial lesions—were also
significantly reduced. We found significant improvement in the
requirements for ad libitum medication (Fig 1). Only 3 patients required the use of any antihistamine; | patient took 10 mg cetirizine
per day, another 10 mg levocetirizine per day, and the third patient
30 mg desloratadine daily. Patient 8 received a monthly dose, was
able to reduce corticosteroids, and remained asymptomatic from
the day after omalizumab was given. However, several days
before the dose, hives and pruritus reappeared.

Five of 9 patients had basopenia. However, patients’ basophil
counts did not change significantly during treatment (pretreatment:
30, IR 18-99; second dose: 65, IR 24.5-157; third dose: 54.5, IR
15.8-285.7). Patient 2, who had been asymptomatic for 2 years
subsequent to the last dose, had an increase in basophil count
to normal (pretreatment, 30; second dose, 0; third dose, 0; after
5 months of remission, 179; after 7 months, 92; after 12 months,
77; after 18 months, 204 basophils), whereas the second patient,
patient 4, had a sustained remission but remained basopenic.

We observed low histamine release on incubation of patients’
basophils with anti-IgE (pretreatment: 0, IR 0-20.4; second
dose: 2.4, IR 1-35.2; third dose: 14.9, IR 6.9-39.9; fourth dose:

 

11, IR 0.17-22.5) and CD63 expression (pretreatment: 7.1, IR
0-53.7; second dose: 0.7, IR 0-5.6; third dose: 19.7, IR 0-39;
fourth dose: 3.1, IR 0-7.8). However, this feature did not change
with treatment. Regarding patients who remained asymptomatic
after treatment, the 1 patient whose basopenia reversed recovered
the ability to release histamine and express CD63 on incubation
with anti-IgE and anti-FceRI receptor, respectively. In contrast,
the patient who remained asymptomatic for 18 months and
remained basopenic did not increase histamine release or CD63
expression on stimulation with anti-IgE. There were no changes
in response to autologous serum as assessed by expression of
CD63 or histamine release.

We report herein a dramatic response to omalizumab in severe
patients with chronic urticaria who were unresponsive to high
doses of antihistamines, corticosteroids, and in some cases,
cyclosporine in the absence of antibody to the IgE receptor or
to IgE as assessed by basophil histamine release. In the current
study, we did not observe any immunologic changes associated
with this effect. One possible explanation is that the efficacy of
omalizumab is subject to perturbation of the cells such as mast
cells, eosinophils,° or basophils that depend on FceRI or IgE even
in the absence of autoantibody. Another alternative is that omalizumab might prevent FceRI dependent-secretion of cytokines and
chemokines’ by a stimulus that is as yet unknown.

Regardless, all patients reported rapid relief of hives and
pruritus, sometimes within 48 hours after the omalizumab
injection. In previous studies that measured FceRI kinetics after
omalizumab treatment,°*” significant downregulation of receptor numbers took at least several days. It seems unlikely that
omalizumab could produce a decrease in IgE receptor density
in an even shorter interval. Thus rapid reduction of plasma IgE
levels might nonspecifically downregulate responsiveness of
cutaneous mast cells and/or basophils by mechanisms not yet
determined that are independent of surface IgE receptor density.

In conclusion, omalizumab can affect the course of chronic
urticaria, dramatically in some instances, even in the absence of
anti-IgE receptor antibody. This outcome, apart from offering a
promising treatment for a highly disabling disease, offers new
approaches to the study of chronic urticaria pathophysiology given
the multiplicity of effects of omalizumab therapy. Large clinical
trials will be needed to establish its indication as a therapy for
chronic urticaria, particularly when it is resistant to antihistamines,
and to determine the best protocol for drug administration.

Circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and
human cathelicidin in healthy adults

To the Editor:

Cathelicidins are a class of widely conserved antimicrobial

peptides produced by essentially all mammalian species as part of
the innate immune system. They have broad activity against both
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and have additional
effects, including neutralizing LPS, stimulating leukocyte chemotaxis, and promoting angiogenesis. There is only 1 known
cathelicidin in humans. Although it is found in the secondary
granules of neutrophils and other leukocyte populations and a
range of squamous epithelia, including the skin, airways, mouth,
and intestine, it also circulates at high levels in the plasma.'? Impairment in cathelicidin or other antimicrobial peptides has been
linked to increased susceptibility to and severity of infection,
whereas overexpression of cathelicidin confers protection against
sepsis in animal models.* Patients with the lowest circulating
levels of cathelicidin undergoing dialysis are at a greater than
2-fold increased risk of death of infectious causes.*
The transcription of CAMP, the gene encoding cathelicidin in
human subjects, is regulated by the vitamin D receptor. In vitro
studies of human tissues, including epithelial cells, macrophages,
and neutrophils, have demonstrated that cathelicidin levels can be
increased after administration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.° Topical and oral vitamin D analogs similarly lead to stimulation of cutaneous cathelicidin production.° Prior studies of cathelicidin have
given particular focus to its antitubercular properties, and human
subjects given a single dose of oral vitamin D demonstrated improved mycobacterial immunity with an ex vivo assay.’ Although
circulating levels of cathelicidin have been most tightly linked to
sepsis and mortality, little is known about the association of vitamin D status and plasma cathelicidin levels in healthy subjects or
of the ability of vitamin D supplementation to alter these levels.
