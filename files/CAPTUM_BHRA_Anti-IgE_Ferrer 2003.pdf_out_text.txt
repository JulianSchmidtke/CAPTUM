IL3 effect on basophils histamine release upon stimulation with

chronic urticaria sera

Background: Chronic urticaria is thought to be an autoimmune disorder in 35—
40% of patients because of the presence of an immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody reactive with the IgE receptor. Patients possessing this antibody are
identified by the ability of serum to degranulate donor basophils to release
histamine. We questioned whether priming of basophils with interleukin 3 (IL3)
would facilitate identification of patients and/or alter the percentage of patients
who have a positive assay.

Methods: We incubated 37 chronic urticaria sera with basophils from donors
with no urticaria with and without priming with IL3 and compared histamine
release in each instance. We also preincubated basophils from a ‘non-releaser’
with IL3, used these cells to assay chronic urticaria sera, and assessed the con

In chronic urticaria autoantibodies against the high
affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor is found in
about 35-40% of patients (1-3). It is caused by the
appearance of an immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody
directed to the alpha subunit of the IgE receptor (or
occasionally IgE) which leads to cutaneous mast cells
degranulation. Cells are activated as a result of receptor
cross-linking (4), and histamine release is augmented by
activation of complement to release C5a (5-7). We have
ound that the basophils of atopic subjects yield better
histamine release than do basophils of nonatopic
individuals, which we assumed was the result of in vivo
priming (8). In order to better assess whether primed
cells would be preferable for assay of such sera, we
have determined the effect of priming basophils with
interleukin 3 (IL3) upon histamine release induced by
sera from chronic urticaria patients. We demonstrate
that preincubation of cells with IL3 does augment
histamine release, but it generally does not convert
negative chronic urticaria patients to be designated
as positive. Yet IL3 stimulation can convert nonresponding basophils to responder cells if they are

‘nonreleasers’, i.e. unresponsive to anti-IgE, but normal
to other secretory stimuli.

Material and methods
Patients and controls

We studied patients with chronic urticaria defined as having
recurrent hives of > 6-week duration, occurring at least four times a
week, with individual lessons lasting over 4h. Antihistamine
treatment was stopped at least 48 h before serum samples were
collected, and none of the patients were taking corticosteroids or
immunosuppressive drugs at the time of venipuncture. Patients with
clinical evidence of urticarial vasculitis or physically induced urticaria (e.g. cold urticaria, cholinergic urticaria, dermatographism)
were excluded.

Atopic controls are those patients with rhinitis and/or asthma,
with positive skin test to at least one allergen, IgE levels higher than
150 kU/l and specific IgE against that allergen. Healthy donors are
those with negative skin prick test to a standard of common allergens, no history of hives, rhinitis or asthma and normal IgE levels.

Basophils were obtained from four normal donors (age
31.67 + 4.91 years) and were incubated with sera obtained from
37 patients with chronic urticaria (24 female, age 44.15 + 3.69 years).
All sera were separated by centrifugation at 1000 g for 10 min
and stored at —80°C.

Leukocyte isolation

Ten millilitres of whole blood was collected in lithium—heparine
coated venopuncture tubes (Venoject, Terumo Europe, Leuven,
Belgium) and were mixed with 2 ml of 3% dextran-3% glucose—
0.15 M NaCl saline solution. The mixture was sedimented for
90 min, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were placed in
15 ml conical tubes which were washed twice with Hank’s balance
salt solution-human seroalbumin (HBSS-HSA) at pH 7.4 (NaCl,
KCl, Hepes 10 mM, HSA, Glucose, NaH»PO,, double distilled
water). The cells were then resuspended in HBSS-HSA containing
2mM CaCh, 1 mM MgCh.

For priming with IL3, cells were incubated with a buffer containing IL3 for 15 min at 37°C (Hepes 20 mM, NaCl 133 mM, KCl
5mM, CaCl 7mM, MgCl 3.5mM, bovine serum albumin
1 mg/ml, 2 ng/ml of IL3) and the spontaneous histamine release in
the presence of IL3 was measured. It did not exceed 5% of total
histamine release.

We incubated basophils with anti-IgE (3 ug/ml, Caltag, Burlingame, CA), as a positive control.

Histamine release from basophils

Two hundred and fifty microlitres of serum or buffer in the presence
or absence of IL3 was incubated with 250 yl of leukocyte suspension for 30 min plus 500 uml of buffer containing Ca and Mg for
30 min at 37°C. After incubation, the supernatants were separated
by centrifugation at 1000 g for 10 min at 4°C, and histamine release
was determined. Two replicates aliquots of cells were boiled to
determine total basophil histamine content.

Histamine release was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Immunotech International, Marseille,
France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and replicate
samples agreed within 10%. The results are expressed as percentage
of total histamine content. Spontaneous histamine was <5% of
total histamine.

The percentage is calculated by using the following formula:
(Sample-Basal)/(Total-Basal) x 100. We considered positive histamine release more than 16% of the total histamine release percentage.

C5a receptor blocking

We blocked C5a by preincubating the cell suspension for 15 min at
37°C with a buffer containing a monoclonal antibody to the antiCSa receptor (Accurate Chemical Scientific Corporation, Westbury,
NY) at a 50 g/ml concentration.

Statistical assays

To compare histamine release with and without IL3 in atopic basophils when incubating with positive sera, a nonparametric two
dependent test: the Rank test with Wilcoxon signs is used. The
Rank test with Wilcoxon signs is also used to compare histamine
release before and after preincubation with IL3 in nonreleaser
atopic basophils and to compare histamine release with negative
sera. To compare histamine release before and after blocking the
CSa receptor we used a Student’s /-test once found a normal distribution. All data are expressed as percentage of histamine release.

Autologous skin test was not performed in the present study or in
the past to these patients.

IL3 and histamine release with urticaria sera

Results

Sera from patients with chronic urticaria previously
shown to release histamine from basophils were retested.
However, the basophils were either primed with IL3 or
were tested in the absence of IL3. As shown in Fig. 1, 11
of 18 sera tested had a significant (> 15%) increment in
histamine release. The difference was significant (without
IL3 median = 27.35 with IL3 median = 41.55, z=
0.004). Serum number 4 might be overlooked in the
basophil histamine release test without IL3 (12.77%
histamine released without IL3 and 17.75% with IL3), it
would have been interesting if positive autologous skin
test was performed.

Then we chose sera from patients with chronic urticaria
which were previously found to be negative in terms of
basophil histamine release, and retested them in the
presence of IL3 (Fig. 2). Only one patient had a 15%
increase in histamine release of 15 sera tested, thus in
general, the presence of IL3 as a primer of basophils does
not convert negative sera to positive ones (Rank test with
Wilcoxon signs z = 0.532, median without IL3 = 6.97
and median with IL3 = 7.85).

We have previously reported the use of basophils
from a ‘nonreleaser’ to stimuli that activate basophils via
the IgE receptor (8), and demonstrated that chronic
urticaria sera are ineffective whereas a cytokine such as
macrophage/monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1)
releases histamine normally. The abnormality appears to
be the result of diminished levels of signal transduction
molecules syk and/or lyn (9-11). Figure 3 demonstrates
an experiment employing these cells in which 16 chronic
urticaria sera are tested for histamine release before
and after stimulating those cells with IL3. Five of these
sera would have been considered positive where our
cutoff is at 15% histamine release, and only one
exceeded 20%. When the cells were primed with IL3,
11 sera demonstrate significant histamine release with
substantial increases in many of them (Rank test with
Wilcoxon signs z = 0.000, median without IL3 = 6.4,
median with IL3 = 29.53). Thus incubation with IL3
appears to reverse the abnormality seen in nonresponder
basophils. The anti-IgE control, however, remained
negative whereas the chronic urticaria sera all contained
anti-IgE receptor. We have previously reported that a
portion of the histamine release observed with chronic
urticaria sera is because of complement activation (6, 7)
and release of CS5a. On Fig. 4 we demonstrate that
purified CSa releases significantly more histamine
from these basophils in the presence of IL3 and that
is inhibited over 90% by anti-CSa receptor. When
IL3-stimulated cells are incubated with chronic urticaria
sera in the presence of anti-CSa receptor, the average
decrease was 15% (Student’s t-test: X with IL3 = 26.00
X blocking with antiC5a = 20.66, P = 0.06).

Figure 4. We explored the role of complement upon release of histamine from basophils on a ‘nonreleaser’ which were primed with
interleukin 3 and incubated with buffer or anti-CSa receptor prior to challenge with sera of chronic urticaria patients known to be

 

positive for histamine release employing atopic basophils.

Nevertheless, 60% of sera from chronic urticaria patients
are negative by this assay and are assumed to have neither
anti-IgE receptor nor anti-IgE that are functional.

To further assess those sera, we re-examined a group of
patients who previously tested positive, and compared
them with a group of patients who had tested negative
with one change in protocol. We obtained basophils from
atopic subjects, pretreated them with IL3 and compared

 

 

 

the results with those obtained with untreated basophils;
the latter conforms to our standard assay. There was a
clear augmentation of histamine release when IL3 was
present (Fig. 1). We then questioned whether this augmentation, if seen with sera that were previously negative,
would increase the percentage of patients thought to have
autoantibodies. As shown in Fig. 2 this does not occur.
There is only one serum whose status would have been

changed from negative to positive and the remaining 14
sera were unchanged.

We did not remove IgE from the basophils (requires
dilute acid treatment) and thus did not attempt to
distinguish the occasional patient with anti-IgE rather
than anti-receptor antibody, which is its main utility.
There are sufficient free IgE receptors to be effectively
stimulated with patient sera, although it is clear that
saturation of receptors with IgE myeloma inhibits histamine release. On the contrary, anti-receptor antibody of
some patients do not compete with IgE for binding (13).
In this instance, we wanted to reproduce the same
conditions as in previous studies and to treat the
basophils with one variable (i.e. IL3) rather than deal
with a separate treatment with dilute acid that is not
physiologic and may alter the cell membrane.

We have also employed basophils from subjects who
are ‘nonreleasers’, i.e. whose basophils do not release
histamine by stimuli that activate through the IgE
receptor but do so if other receptors (e.g. CCR2 for
MCP-1) are stimulated. One such patient employed
previously (8) was retested with a group of positive sera
with and without IL3 priming. There was a striking
increase in histamine release in many (but not all) of the
subjects’ sera tested indicating that IL3 can reverse, at
least at a part, the secretory defect thought to be because
of ineffective mobilization of syk and lyn (9-11).
Nevertheless the anti-IgE control remained negative
and reversing this may require a 2-3 h preincubation
with IL3 rather than the 30-min preincubation used
herein (14). This is an acquired abnormality that is

variably present, and potentially reversible (15). One
alternative possibility is that the effect of IL3 is to induce
expression of the CSa receptor and that the augmentation seen is primarily the result of complement. However, by employing an antibody to the CS5a receptor,
we decreased release by an average of 15% (Fig. 4),
somewhat less than observed with a different group of
subjects (30%) (7). Thus the contribution of complement
is too low to account for the IL3-dependent enhancement seen.

Our data suggest that the ease of identification of
patients with chronic urticaria who have antibody to the
IgE receptor or to IgE is facilitated if the leukocytes are
first primed with IL3. It does not affect the percentage
positivity but augments positive sera so that they are
more readily identified. We also want to mention that it
does not mean a significant additional cost calculating the
amount used per patient. This is particularly important,
as there is no binding assay (ELISA or immunoblot) that
can be used to accurately screen the patients for the
antibody (8, 16), and we rely, for the present time, upon
functional assays. Thus incorporating an IL3 priming
step is recommended when sera are tested for anti-IgE
receptor antibody.
