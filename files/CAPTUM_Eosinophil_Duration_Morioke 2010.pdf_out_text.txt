Abstract Delayed pressure urticaria (DPU) is characterized by deep dermal wheals that appear in response to a
local continuous pressure. Although it has been reported to
complicate as many as 40% of cases of Caucasian patients
with chronic urticaria, no definitive cases of Asian/
Japanese patients have been reported in English literature.
Here, we identified 17 cases of DPU, among 540 Japanese
patients with urticaria (3.1%), based on careful history
taking, pressure challenge test and, ideally, skin biopsy.
Twelve out of 17 patients (70.5%) who undertook pressure
challenge test developed wheal and erythema in the area of
pressure 1-12 h later. Six out of 15 patients (40%) were
positive for the autologous serum skin test. All cases were
complicated with ordinary chronic urticaria, and all specimens of skin biopsies performed for 12 patients showed
substantial eosinophil infiltration. All cases were resistant
to antihistamines with or without other non-steroidal
medications and eventually treated with 0.25-1.5 mg/day
of betamethasone. However, 12 of them (70.6%) were able
to cease steroid use because of cure or remission. For those
cured or in remission, the duration of steroid administration
and that from the onset to diagnosis was 11.2 + 11.0 and
54.8 + 60.2 months (mean + SD), respectively. DPU may
be identified as a relatively rare complication of Japanese
patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria. A proper diagnosis and a small amount of steroid may be beneficial for
the treatment of DPU.

Introduction

Delayed pressure urticaria (DPU) is characterized by deep
dermal wheals that appear in the continuously compressed
region 30 min or several hours after the release of the
compression. The wheals last for several hours or up to
3 days, and may accompany a burning sensation and/or pain
rather than itching [11]. The effectiveness of antihistamines
is low, and many cases of DPU require oral steroids to suppress symptoms [3]. Eosinophil infiltration is a histopathological feature of DPU, but the diagnosis of DPU is usually
made based on careful history taking and, ideally, pressure
challenge test as necessary [9]. In Europe, DPU has been
reported to coexist in as many as 40% of chronic urticaria
cases [2]. However, there are no definitive reports of Asian
patients in this regard, except for a few case reports written in
Japanese. We here report 17 Japanese cases of DPU who
visited our institute from April 2002 to June 2009, with an
analysis of their clinical and histological features.

Materials and methods
Subjects

In this study, 17 patients with DPU were studied

1-89 years old, mean age 38.4 + 19.6 years old, gender
192 males, 348 females) referred to Hiroshima University
Hospital from April 2002 to June 2009. DPU was diagnosed on the basis of at least two episodes of wheals that
had appeared 30 min or several hours after the continuous
local compression and had been prolonged for more than
12h.

Skin biopsies were performed after getting oral and
written informed consent in the manner approved by a
committee of Hiroshima University Hospital, and pressure
challenge test was performed under oral informed consent.

Clinical examination

We conducted complete blood counts, biochemical
examinations, and skin biopsy, as necessary, of wheals
that had appeared for several hours or longer. For pressure tests, we developed a device that was adjusted for six
healthy adult Japanese individuals (2 males, 4 females)
referring to the condition advocated by Kobza Black et al.
[4]. The pressure test device consists of a perforated
50 cm x 50 cm acrylic flame, 1 kg weights, and a I-kg
steel rod of 1.4 cm diameter. A rod with weights was
perpendicularly lowered through the acrylic flame on a
patient’s back as shown in (Fig. 1). We performed pressure challenge tests for 17 cases by compressing their
lower back skin with a pressure of 4 kg/1.5 cm? for
15 min. Autologous serum skin test (ASST) was conducted as previously described [12]. We intradermally
injected 50 pl of autologous serum, 20 yl of 10 pg/ml
histamine as positive control, and 50 pl of 0.9% sterile
saline as negative control. The skin reaction was determined as positive if the serum-induced flare diameter was
>5 mm than saline control or larger than the flare induced
by histamine at 30 min as reported earlier [8, 12].

Outcomes in response to medications

Patients were classified as “cured” if their urticarial symptoms resolved and never recurred without any further treatments for not <6 weeks, as “remission” if their symptoms
never recurred with non-corticosteroid therapy, and as
“amelioration” if symptoms were suppressed with therapies
including corticosteroid for 6 weeks or longer, respectively.

Results
Clinical features

All of 17 cases diagnosed as DPU (age 29-63 years old,
mean age 46.7 + 11.8 years old, gender: 5 males, 12
females) had also suffered from chronic idiopathic urticaria
which was characterized by relatively deep and spontaneously occurring wheals. The duration of each wheal was
12-72 h (48.74 17.7h, mean + SD). The time from
patients’ first awareness of urticaria to the diagnosis of
DPU was 55.9 + 61.3 months (Table 1). None of them
showed apparently abnormal data in complete blood counts
and common biochemical examinations.

 

 

 

 

Pressure challenge test

Six healthy adult Japanese individuals (4 males, 2 females)
were challenged by rods with weights on 1.5 cm? areas of
their backs. They could tolerate bearing up to 4 kg of
weight for 15 min. Four of them felt comfortable bearing a
rod with four weights (5 kg), or with three weights (4 kg)
for up to 15 min. We therefore carried pressure tests with a
rod with three weights (4 kg/1.5 cm?) for 15 min on 17
patients with urticaria diagnosed as DPU based on their
histories. Twelve of them (70.5%) developed a wheal and/
or an erythema in the area of pressure 1-12 h later
(Fig. 2a). In four cases, the wheal enlarged over the compressed area (Fig. 2b).

Autologous serum skin test

Six out of 15 patients who undertook ASST (40.0%) were
determined as positive. This positive rate was similar to 30
out of 72 (41.6%) patients with chronic urticaria without
DPU [12].

Histopathological inspection

All of 12 patients who undertook skin biopsies showed a
moderate to strong infiltration of eosinophils with other
inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils and lymphocytes,
in the superficial perivascular area of the dermis (Fig. 3).

Treatments

All patients were treated by antihistamines either according
to the manufacturer’s recommended dose or higher doses,
with or without other therapeutic drugs, such as montelukast, tranexamic acid and cimetidine. All cases were
resistant to those treatments, and additionally administered
oral steroid (betamethasone 0.25-1.5 mg/day). However,
symptoms of three patients (17.6%) treated by medications

including oral steroid eventually resolved and they were
able to discontinue all treatments (classified in “cure”).
Symptoms in nine patients (52.9%) remitted and they
continued treatments without oral steroid (“remission”),
and the symptoms in the other five patients (29.4%) were
improved with medications including oral steroid (“amelioration”) (Table 1). Durations of steroid administration to
the cured three cases were 28, 4, and 3 months, respectively. Periods of overall treatment by our team for these
cases were 36, 20, and 8 months, respectively. Durations of
steroid administration to the remitted nine cases were from
1 to 36 months. The average duration of steroid administration in the cured or remitted cases was 11.1 + 11.0
(mean + SD) months (Table 1).

 

 

Discussion

We identified 17 cases of DPU among 540 Japanese
patients with urticaria. All of them suffered from spontaneously occurring wheals as well as wheals induced by a
pressure. The pressure challenge test evoked wheals in 12
out of 17 patients (70.5%), whereas all 12 patients
inspected by skin biopsies showed marked eosinophil
infiltration. A positive rate of ASST among patients with
DPU, 40%, was almost similar to that among patients with
chronic urticaria without DPU in our institute [12].

The frequency of DPU in our cases of urticaria, 3.1%, is
much less than 40% reported by Barlow et al. [2], who
performed a pressure challenge test on all 135 cases of
chronic urticaria, but similar to, or slightly larger than 2%
reported by Champion [6]. We might have overlooked
patients with DPU potentials without an apparent history of
pressure-associated wheals, because we had not performed
the pressure challenge test for all patients with urticaria.
However, we have likely revealed the maximal reactions of
patients who received the challenge test since the pressure
employed in this study, 4 kg/1.5 cm? on patients’ back for
15 min, was larger than previously reported ones. The
pressure challenge test reported by Barlow et al. [2] consisted in using steel rods of 1.5 cm diameter, and weights
of 2.5 and 3.5 kg Pressure challenge tests, which were
recently proposed by the EAACI/GA*LEN/EDF/UNEV
consensus panel, consisted in applying metal rods of
1.5 cm diameter and weights of 2.5 kg, or metal rods of
6.5 cm diameter and weights of 5 kg for 15 min onto the
skin of forearm, back or anterior thighs [9].

On the other hand, all histological specimens from 12
patients clinically diagnosed as DPU revealed substantial
eosinophilic infiltration regardless of results in the pressure
challenge test. McEvoy [10] et al. reported the infiltration
of eosinophils and the deposit of major basic protein inside
and outside of the cell in wheals of DPU. Moreover, various proteins in eosinophil granules, including major basic
protein, secreted by eosinophil activation increase vascular
permeability both via mast cell activation and by a direct
effect on vessels [7]. Barlow et al. reported that the
expression of adhesion molecules, such as E-selectin,
ICAM-1, and VCAM-1, increased in DPU, in 6-24 h after
a compression. They argued that the overexpression of
such molecules may induce a dense cellular infiltration [1].
Taken together, marked eosinophil infiltration and their
activation may be more important than the reproducibility
of pressure challenge tests and reactions in ASST for both
diagnosis and the pathogenesis of DPU.

Since all 17 cases of DPU in this study were diagnosed
as a complication of chronic idiopathic urticaria, it may be

necessary to characterize DPU as a special subtype of
chronic urticaria rather than an independent disease entity.
Five patients recognized that pressure-associated wheals
continued longer than spontaneous ones, but no apparent
differences of durations were recognized by the other 12
patients with DPU.

In the treatment of DPU, antihistamines were not sufficient by themselves to suppress wheal generation in
accordance with previous publications. We observed
partial remission of symptoms in 3 out of 17 cases by
combinations of montelukast and second generation antihistamines, as reported by Nettis et al. [11]. However, all of
our patients, including these three patients, were not tolerable in spite of various combinations of medications
except for steroids. Steroid administration for chronic
urticaria is not generally recommended because of adverse
effects. In fact, 5 out of 17 patients in our study had temporal side effects such as general fatigue, moon face, and
diabetes. In the literature, various medications, such as
dapsone, methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and nimesulide, have
been tried for refractory DPU as well as steroid [5].
However, the duration of steroid administration in 12
patients in “cure” and “remission” of DPU was much
shorter than the duration of their illness until the diagnosis
(1.1411.0 vs. 54.8 + 60.2 months; mean + SD).
Therefore, as far as DPU is concerned, steroid administration might not only suppress apparent symptoms, but
also shorten the duration of the illness. To confirm the
utility of steroids for DPU, a larger scale study is needed.

In conclusion, a diagnosis of DPU coexisting with
chronic idiopathic urticaria should be considered important
to determine reliable prognosis and the selection of
appropriate treatments.
