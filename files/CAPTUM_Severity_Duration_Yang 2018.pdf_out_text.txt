Background: Chronic urticaria is a bothersome skin disease, and Chinese herbal
medicine (CHM) is commonly used as adjuvant therapy. This study aimed to evaluate
the effectiveness and safety of the mixture of two CHM formula, Xiao-Feng-San (XFS)
and Qing-Shang-Fang-Feng-Tang (QSFFT), in treating urticaria through a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Methods: 78 participants entered the screening phase between November 2012 and
August 2015. Participants were randomly and equally allocated in either CHM group
(2 gm XFS and 2 gm QSFFT four times a day and 5mg levocetirizine once daily for
28 days followed by 5mg levocetirizine once daily alone for 28 days) or control group
(placebo and 5mg levocetirizine daily followed by 5mg levocetirizine once daily for 28
days alone). Symptom improvement was set as the primary outcome, and the influence
on sleep quality and changes in serum markers were used as secondary outcomes. Per
protocol design was applied to the final analysis.

Results: A total of 56 participants entered the final analysis stage. Participants in
the CHM group had more prominent symptom relief on day 56 (the weekly urticaria
activity score, UAS7, as 9.9 + 9.2 vs. 15.6 + 10.8, p = 0.038). In the CHM group,
participants’ symptom severity reduced progressively (trend analysis, p < 0.001) while
the decreasing trend was less favored in the control group (trend analysis, p = 0.056). The
life quality improved gradually in both groups, while the differences between CHM and
control groups were statistically insignificant. For urticaria-related cytokines, interferon-y
seemed to decrease positively in the CHM group (about 30.8% reduction from baseline,

trend analysis p = 0.013). For safety issue, the CHM prescription was well-tolerated with
no noticeable long-term side effects when compared to the control group. At 6-month
follow-up of symptom changes after the end of the trial, the CHM group participants
reported positive results in no recurrence or >50% improvement (36.3% in CHM group
vs. 20% in Control group, p = 0.108).

Conclusions: The combination of XFS and QSFFT tended to be feasible and tolerable
adjuvant therapy for urticaria in addition to standard therapy. However, larger study
population with longer follow-up duration may be still needed.

INTRODUCTION

Urticaria is one of the most prevalent dermatological diseases,
which is diagnosed with clinical manifestations of severe itching
and recurrent wheals with central pallor (Bossi et al., 2011). The
lifetime prevalence can be as high as 20% with any urticaria
among general populations, and hence, it carries a heavy burden
to the whole health system and patients’ life (Ferrer, 2009;
Zuberbier et al., 2009). The pathophysiology of urticaria is
complicated, and thus, a long-term use of a combination of
medications may be needed to control refractory symptoms
(Fine and Bernstein, 2016; Kulthanan et al., 2016; Rimoldi et al.,
2016). The candidate medications include non-sedating antihistamines, glucocorticosteroids, cyclosporine, and leukotrienes
antagonists (Cassano et al., 2006; Bossi et al., 2011; Takeda
et al., 2011). Omalizumab, an anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE)
antibody, is another potential therapy for urticaria, but its use
is still limited because of high medication costs and possible
symptom recurrence after discontinuation (Vichyanond, 2011;
Maurer et al., 2013). Additionally, its side effects, such as systemic
immunosuppression and endocrine disorders, and medication
dependence remain as concerns to patients (Kaplan, 2012).
Therefore, even under multiple Western medicine treatments,
there are still unmet medical demands for symptom control in
urticaria, and therefore, alternative treatments have been sought
urgently (Magerl et al., 2010; Zazzali et al., 2012).

Accordingly, complementary and alternative medicine
(CAM) becomes a possible option in addition to commonly
used Western medication therapies. In the US, about 37%
patients referred to the dermatology department of a tertiary
care center have used at least one kind of herb supplement for
their dermatologic problems (Kalaaji et al., 2012). In Taiwan,
traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is the most commonly
used CAM, and Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is the most

commonly used modality of TCM. Other modalities include
acupuncture, massage, and moxibustion (Chang et al., 2008;
Chen et al., 2012). Among the more than 600 kinds of CHM used
for urticaria in Taiwan, the core herbal formula is Xiao-Feng-San
(XFS), which was identified by our previous published work
based on the nationwide prescription database (Lin et al., 2013;
Chen et al., 2015). XFS has anti-allergy, anti-oxidation, and antiinflammation effects, and it can also recover the adequate balance
between Th1 and Th2 immune systems (Akamatsu et al., 1998;
Nose et al., 1999; Gao et al., 2005). About 50% of all prescriptions
for urticaria contained XFS; however, the combinations of XFS
with other CHMs with anti-inflammatory effects seem necessary
in the whole CHM pharmacologic network for urticaria, in
which nearly all CHMs used with XFS have an anti-inflammation
effect (Chen et al., 2015). For this reason, the Qing-Shang-FangFeng-Tang (QSFFT), a famous CHM formula commonly used
for inflammatory skin diseases, may become an ideal candidate
medication for urticaria when combined with XFS. However,
this combination is not as common as others and its effectiveness
has not been proven yet (Chen et al., 2015, 2016).

This study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of
combining XFS and QSFFT for treating urticaria as an adjuvant
therapy to standard anti-histamine medication by conducting
a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
Since CHM is often used as the complementary therapy in
the clinical setting, the evaluation of symptoms and changes
of serum markers are crucial for understanding the role of the
fixed combination of XFS and QSFFT in urticaria. Moreover,
the potential unwanted effects are also assessed for increasing
concerns of CHM (Werner, 2014; Teschke and Eickhoff, 2015).

 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design

A two-arm randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind
clinical trial of 78 participants with urticaria was conducted at
Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH) in Taiwan (Figure 1).
The subjects were recruited through advertisements and clinical
visits and enrolled by dermatologists, rheumatologists, and
TCM doctors, after considering the inclusion and exclusion
criteria (Appendix A). All participants had written informed

consent, and the trial was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was approved by
the Institutional Review Board of the Chang-Gung Memorial
Foundation (No. 101-2270A3) and carried out in accordance
with the recommendation of the guideline for clinical trials of
the same committee.

To closely resemble the clinical setting in the real world,
in which combining CHM and Western medicine therapy
is favored, we try to examine the benefit of add-on CHM
therapy for urticaria. After screening for symptom severity
and completeness of informed consent, all enrolled participants
were given levocetirizine 5 mg once daily with either CHM or
placebo medication for the first 4 weeks and then levocetirizine
5mg alone once daily for the following 4 weeks. The first
4 weeks were referred to as the treatment phase (for shortterm effect), while the following 4 weeks were the follow-up
phase (for long-term effect). Levocetirizine was chosen as the
comparative and baseline therapy in this study because of the
recommendation from the dermatologist and rheumatologist in
our research team. A total of three in-person visits was arranged
for each participant for 8 weeks with the following schedule:
day 0 (baseline), day 28 (end of CHM/control medication),
and day 56 (end of trial). Two dates were also set to record
symptom severity (days 7 and 35). Satisfaction surveillance
through telephone contact was done for all participants 6 months
after the trial finished. Outcome assessments were recorded
using a self-assessed questionnaire, while blood samplings were
done three times (days 0, 28, and 56) for urticaria-related
cytokine assessment, differential blood count, and biochemical
profiles of the renal and liver functions. Any adverse events,
medication compliances, and concomitant other medications,
including Western medicine, folk medicine, and herbal medicine,
were recorded routinely by project staff. Baseline characteristic
data, such as gender, birthday, comorbidities, food/drug allergy,
and history of urticaria, were acquired at the first visit
(day 0).

 

Randomization and Allocation

Concealment

Randomization was done by a trial administrator who was
not involved in the clinical intervention or evaluation using a
computer-generated random sequence before medications were
administered. The random sequences evenly distributed
all participants to two study arms. Medication bottles
with opaque and identical appearance were filled by the
medication manufacturer and were then labeled according
to the generated random sequences. The pharmacy of
CGMH was then provided with these medication bottles in
consecutive number randomized as active and placebo. The
enrolled participants were then given their interventions
with the sequential number on the medication bottles. The
randomization and allocation processes were adequately
concealed and stored in a security box. All doctors, pharmacists,
project managers, statisticians, and participants in this research
were blinded to the allocation sequence throughout the entire
trial phase.

Chinese Herbal Medicine Formulation and
Dosage

The CHM used in this study was a mixture of two wellknown classical formulas, XFS and QSFFT, and each formula
was produced at the same time by the Chuang Song
Zong Pharmaceutical Company, which is a licensed good
manufactured practice pharmaceutical factory in Kaohsiung,
Taiwan. On the TCM’s viewpoint, XFS is regarded as the
important CHM formula to dispel exterior wind and heat,
and this makes XFS become one of the most commonly used
CHM for allergic skin diseases (Lin et al., 2013; Chen et al.,
2015). On the other hand, QSFFT is used to enhance the
efficacy of XFS on eliminating exterior heat. Both exterior
heat and wind are thought to be the primary pathogenesis
in urticaria. Wind represents that urticaria is a dermatologic
(exterior) disease and the clinical course is often changing
rapidly, while heat indicates the reddish and itching skin lesions
of urticaria. For this reason, we combined XFS and QSFFT as
the CHM treatment in this study as we treat urticaria patients
in clinical practice. These two formulas were premade from
raw ingredients according to the preparation methods recorded
in the classics. In detail, an aqueous extract was obtained
from the raw ingredients with a fixed proportion listed in
Table 1, and the essential oil of QSFFT was recovered during
the extraction process. Then, the concentrated powder of each
formula was made separately by adding the extract to starch
particles as excipients. No raw ingredients were added into
the powder. Standard analytic methods were used to validate
the composition of CHM (Appendix B), and the pesticide,
microbiology contaminants, and heavy metal were all carefully
examined according to the regulation in Taiwan. Similar to
treating urticaria in daily clinical practice, we merely combined
these two kinds of concentrated powder for the subjects in
the CHM group. Additionally, the placebo was made from
microcrystalline cellulose (49.7%), corn starch (49.7%), sodium
carboxyl methylcellulose (0.6%), and food colorings (caramel,
yellow #5, and yellow #6) to produce a similar taste, smell, and
appearance of the pharmaceutically made CHM mixture. Both
CHM and placebo were given in opaque capsules, weighing
500 mg per capsule. They were taken four times a day, eight
capsules each time.

 

Outcome Assessment

Primary Outcome

The symptom severity of urticaria was designed as the primary
outcome of this study and was obtained using self-administered,
well-validated questionnaires, the weekly urticaria activity score
(UAS7) and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), on
every visit (days 0, 7, 28, 35, and 56 for UAS7 and days 0, 28,
and 56 for DLQI). Both questionnaires were commonly used for
symptom assessment by clinicians and had been well-validated
(Finlay and Khan, 1994; Khalil et al., 2015). These measurements
were in high agreement with symptom severity and therefore
were excellent to be used to assess symptom relief as the primary
endpoint in this study.

Secondary Outcomes

mprovements in sleep disturbance were used as one of the
secondary outcomes for patients with chronic urticaria since
sleep disturbance is thought to be one of the commonest
complications of urticaria in Taiwan, and one important
ingredient of XFS is beneficial to insomnia (Yang et al., 2005;
Lin et al., 2013). The validated Athens Insomnia Scale in Chinese
version (CAIS-8), which is an eight-question questionnaire
rated on a 0-3 scale, was used to evaluate insomnia with a
great agreement with sleep disorders. People who score higher
than six were considered to have sleep disorders (Soldatos
et al., 2003; Chung et al., 2011). Furthermore, to understand
the possible effects of the treatments on the immune system,
examinations on urticaria-related cytokine changes in serum
were studied, including IgE, eosinophil, C-reactive protein,
interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, tumor necrosis
factor-a, interferon-y, and histamine. Also, trial medication
compliances, other medications or healthy food intake, and
concomitant other treatments for urticaria were required to
be reported spontaneously, and all these events were recorded
routinely during the whole trial period.

 

Safety and Adverse Events Monitoring

All adverse events were requested to be reported to the project
manager at any time they happened, and all suspicious events
were closely monitored during the treatment and follow-up
phases of the trial. The participants were encouraged to report
any symptoms and discomforts, even unusual ones. Additionally,
after giving proper information and explanation, blood tests were
taken on days 0, 28, and 56. The complete blood count, aspartate
aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen,
and creatinine were also checked before and after the trial was
completed.

Statistical Analysis

Sample Size Estimation

There are few clinical trials on the effects of CHM on urticaria.
On the basis of one similar clinical trial, although the symptom
severity measurement system was quite different, 41 participants
per arm were needed to detect about 30% improvement in
the active treatment group (Long et al., 2010). Under such
circumstance, the 80% power at the significance of 0.05 can be
achieved. For an expected dropout rate of <20%, a total of 100

enrollments in 1:1 ratio between the control and CHM arms were
designed before the beginning of the clinical trial.

Statistical Methods

Counts and percentage were used to present categorical data,
while mean with standard deviation to describe numerical
data. To compare the initial status and outcomes between the
CHM and control groups, x? statistics were used to examine
the differences of categorical data, while independent t-tests
to check the numerical data, including symptom scores and
cytokine concentrations. Additionally, trend analysis for changes
in symptom severity and cytokine concentration was carried
out by one-way analysis of variances and paired t-test were
used to examine the within-group differences before and after
the CHM/placebo treatments. Finally, the self-report followup was conducted by phone contact at 6 months after the
end of the trial. The symptom severity and recurrence were
categorized as follows: no recurrence, > 50% improvement,
<50% improvement, and no improvement. In this case, x2
statistics were used to examine the differences between the
CHM and control groups. The sample size estimation before
and after the study was carried out using G*Power (version

3.1), and the statistic tests were processed using SPSS (version
15.0, Chicago, IL, USA) with a per-protocol analysis. Any
events that did not conform to the requirements of this trial
design, such as missing data, poor medication compliance,
and trial withdrawals, were reported in detail. In the case of
missing values, the last value would be used. P < 0.05 or
less than the p-value modified by the Bonferroni's method
for multiple comparisons were thought to be statistically
significant.

RESULTS

Patients Recruitment

A total of 78 volunteer candidates underwent screening between
November 2012 and August 2015, and four were excluded
because they did not sign the informed consent and did not want
to participate in the trial even after a detailed explanation. In
August 2015, this trial was terminated because of fund shortage
even though the preset goal of 100 participants was not achieved.
Subsequently, a total of 74 patients underwent randomization
and were allocated to either the CHM group or control group.
Figure 1 shows the enrollment flow diagram in detail. In the

treatment phase, levocetirizine with either CHM or placebo was
taken from days 0 to 28. Four participants were excluded from
the CHM group: three had too mild urticaria (with a UAS7 lower
than 10 when the trial was initiated), and one refused to fill
in the questionnaire. On the other hand, five participants were
excluded from the control group: two only had a mild symptom,
and three refused to fill in the questionnaire. Furthermore, in the
follow-up phase, five participants were excluded from the CHM
group (two had poor medication compliance, and three had
unknown medication) and three participants from the control
group (two for poor medication compliance and one quitted for
no reason). Finally, the per-protocol analysis was done in 56
participants, with 28 members in each group, who completed the
entire trial.

Baseline Characteristics

The baseline characteristics of the CHM and control groups
are summarized in Table 2. There were no statistical differences
between the CHM and control groups, including patient
age, gender, comorbidities, food/drug allergy history, previous
duration of urticaria, past medication history for urticaria, initial
UAS7, and biochemical profiles. Hemoglobin (Hb) levels between
the CHM and control groups have a statistical difference, but
both their Hb levels were within the normal range.

Primary Outcomes

Figure 2 summarizes the changes in symptom severity of
urticaria as the primary outcome. The trend analysis showed that
symptom severity decreased progressively in the CHM group
(p < 0.001) than in the control group (p = 0.056). An effective
symptom relief could be found both in the CHM and control
groups, and the symptom severity tended to be lower in the CHM
group. The mean UAS7 in the CHM group was 22.80 at baseline
and decreased to 13.2 at 28 days and 9.9 at 56 days. On the other
hand, the mean score in the control group decreased from 22.1 at
baseline to 14.7 at 28 days, and it slightly increased to 15.6 on 56
days. However, the differences in symptom severity between the
CHM and control groups only achieved borderline significance
when corrected by the Bonferroni’s method (p = 0.038).
The improvements in life quality had a similar trend with that
of the relief of symptom severity of urticaria. Nonetheless, both
groups tended to improve gradually in life quality (both have
Pp < 0.001 for trend analysis). On day 28, about 50% improvement
can be observed in both groups, while the improvement became
slightly better in the CHM group (Table 3). On day 56, DLQI
continually decreased in the CHM group and slightly increased
in the control group.

 

 

 

 

Secondary Outcomes

Sleep Disturbance

Table 3 shows that the improvements in sleep disturbances were
not different between the CHM and control groups, and the trend
analysis showed that both groups had no positive tendency to
improve insomnia.

The changes in serum cytokines are summarized in Table 3. The
changes in serum IL-13 in the CHM group were prominently
different from the control group. Serum IL-13 in the CHM
group declined from 4.26 pg/mL at baseline to 2.58 pg/mL at
day 28 and returned to 4.31 pg/mL at day 56. In the control
group, serum IL-13 continually decreased from 3.39 pg/mL
at baseline to 2.39 pg/mL and 2.30 pg/mL at days 28 and
56, respectively (p = 0.047). Besides, the downward trend
of serum IFN-y could be seen in the CHM group, and the
differences between days 0 and 56 were larger in the CHM

group (39.65 and 41.85 pg/mL, respectively; trend analysis,

Safety Evaluation

All adverse events during the study period were reported and
well-followed-up (Table 4). No significant difference in the
incidence of adverse events between the CHM and control
groups was seen (p = 0.252). Although the incidence seemed
higher in the CHM group (21.4%), the causal relations were
not definite. No deaths, anaphylactic shock episodes, or other
major imbalances in any system organ affected by adverse events
were reported during the study period. Adverse events reported
included sweating, constipation, chest tightness, dizziness, herpes
zoster, common cold, and sneeze. Additionally, the evaluations
on the liver and kidney function profiles were all within the
normal range before and after the trials (data not shown).

Follow-up Satisfaction

As a subjective outcome, the 6-month follow-up satisfaction was
also assessed by phone contact with 42 available participants: 22
in the CHM group and 20 in the control group. The higher 6month response rate was found in the CHM group (36.4% vs.
20%) with “no recurrence” or “improvement > 50%.” However,
the difference between both groups had no statistical significance
(p = 0.054; Table 5).

QSFFT, with levocetirizine through a standard randomized,
placebo-controlled, and double-blind clinical trial design. The
ey findings were that the CHM formula might reduce symptom
severity during the treatment phase and the effect might
expand through the follow-up phase. The decreasing trend in
UAS7 implied that the symptoms of urticaria, including flareup area, frequency, and itching severity, could be controlled
in a better manner than levocetirizine alone. Additionally,
the decreasing trend could be seen in the changes in the
DLQI, in which the participants in both groups reported
significant improvement during the treatment and follow-up
phases, and the borderline differences between the CHM and
control groups could also be seen on day 56. Both CHM addon levocetirizine and levocetirizine alone can effectively relieve
symptoms of urticaria after 1 month of treatment. However,
the participants with CHM treatment have longer and better
control of urticaria even though CHM was discontinued for
28 days. Furthermore, although we only had the subjective
assessment on symptom severity 6 months after trial completion
and the statistical significance was not achieved, there was
a tendency that add-on CHM therapy may lead to better
and long-term symptom relief. Using levocetirizine alone
seemed to be only effective during the treatment phase. This
may imply that the add-on CHM therapy has a_ higher
cost-effectiveness value and different molecular pathways are
influenced by CHM other than levocetirizine (Nettis et al.,
2006).

This finding also implies that the use of CHM prescription
may be helpful in reducing the use of levocetirizine since
a 28-day duration of CHM and levocetirizine combination

could improve the symptoms for 2 months or perhaps even 6
months. According to the present clinical consensus, patients’
symptom severity determines the use of levocetirizine and the
need for more advanced therapies, including corticosteroids,
immunosuppressant, and monoclonal antibodies (Beck et al.,
2017). Because of the more severe adverse effects and the higher
costs of the advanced therapies, patients with chronic urticaria
may be reluctant to receive those therapies even though the
levocetirizine-alone therapy has its limitation, as the sustained
symptoms were observed in our study during the second
month. For this reason, the addictive effect of CHM combined
with levocetirizine would become important for patients with
chronic urticaria, so that a higher dose or longer duration
of levocetirizine and the advanced therapies would not be
necessary. However, a more extended treatment period and more
study participants may be needed to make the differences more
substantial.

Furthermore, the changes in serum immunologic markers
may be helpful to recognize the potential mechanisms of CHM.
INF-y tended to decrease more prominently in the CHM
group. INF-y was reported as an indicator of autoreactive
CD4* T cells targeting FceRIa and was found higher among
patients with chronic urticaria (Ying et al., 2002; Auyeung
et al., 2016). Although Th2 was thought to be predominant
in causing urticaria, the suppression on INF-y may also play
an important role in maintaining the balance of the immune
system of patients with urticaria. The possible reason for the
add-on effects of CHM formula maybe related to the plausible
effects of the ingredients in the CHM formula to the antihistamine effect provided by levocetirizine (Nettis et al., 2006).
Although the pharmacologic mechanisms on a human were not
acknowledged, XFS, which is one of the CHM formulas used in
this trial, has the effects of inhibiting histamine release from mast
cells, reducing inflammatory response by inhibiting neutrophil
function, scavenging free radicals, and decreasing IL-4 and INFy in vivo (Akamatsu et al., 1998; Nose et al., 1999; Gao et al.,
2005). Furthermore, the ingredients of another CHM formula,
QSFFT, were reported to have a strong anti-oxidative stress effect
in vivo, and oxidative stress was proven to be one of the crucial
factors of chronic urticaria (Sagdic et al., 2011; Dilek et al.,
2016; Zhang et al., 2016). These “multiple herbs, multiple target”
pharmacologic effects were characteristics of CHM treatments
and can be the potential explanation about add-on effects for
urticaria.

Additionally, the remaining effect of CHM for relieving
urticaria after medication discontinuation may imply that the
4-week washout period for the CHM trials is not enough to
eliminate the entire effect of CHM. Previous clinical trial designs
revealed that a 4-week washout period was thought to be
reasonable for CHM intervention (Fung et al., 1999; Huang et al.,
2014); however, this has not been proven yet. In this trial, the
remaining and even more remarkable effects of CHM can be seen
4 weeks after discontinuation. This may imply that the washout
period should be longer than 1 month to evaluate the efficacy of
CHM in a crossover design.

This study has some limitations. First, the participant
enrollment was not as expected because of insufficient funding.

 

 

Therefore, some of the statistical evaluation between the
CHM and control groups achieved only borderline statistical
significance, even the difference between the two groups seemed
substantial in clinical perspectives. However, we believe that the
statistical significance would be achieved with a larger participant
number under the impression of the marked tendency for CHM
to be a candidate adjuvant therapy for urticaria. As one of
the most crucial implications for further clinical studies, the
optimum subject number should be 74 for each arm (a total of
148), which was calculated by effect size 0.57 (from the differences
on day 56) with an a error of 0.0125 (corrected for four
comparisons) and f error of 0.8 in 1:1 treatment-control design.
Second, the CHM used in this study was premade concentrated
powder, and we used only four important compounds to examine
the composition of CHM instead of authenticating all its herbal
ingredients. Although we did not have detailed data for each
herbal ingredient, the four compounds were good enough to
determine the composition of a CHM formula according to the
regulation for producing CHM in Taiwan. Also, since these two
formulas were premade and were the same as those used in
clinical practice, the repeatability of the study results could be
retained. Third, since this trial was conducted in a single medical
center in Taiwan, the pathogenesis or management of chronic
urticaria may be different from Western countries. Therefore, the
generalizability of using XFS and QSFFT for chronic urticaria
may be limited in the Chinese population, and an examination
of the external validity is still needed.

 

 

 

CONCLUSIONS

In clinical settings, CHM is one of the most commonly used
adjuvant therapies to Western medicine in Taiwan, and this trial
provides the proof that CHM therapy with XFS and QSFFT
could be a potential adjuvant therapy to levocetirizine to control
urticaria in a longer and better manner. Besides, the safety of
CHM was also proven to be similar to levocetirizine alone and
is well-tolerated. This work warrants further larger-scale clinical
trials and also bench studies on XFS and QSFFT as the core and
effective CHM treatments for managing urticaria.
