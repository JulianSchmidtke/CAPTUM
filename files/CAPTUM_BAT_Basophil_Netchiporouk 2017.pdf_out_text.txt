IMPORTANCE Chronic urticaria (CU) affects 0.1% to 0.3% of children. Most cases have no
identifiable trigger and are classified as chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). At least half of
patients with CSU may have an autoimmune etiology that can be determined in vitro using
the basophil activation test (BAT). While 30% to 55% of CU cases resolve spontaneously
within 5 years in adults, the natural history and predictors of resolution in children are
not known.

OBJECTIVE To assess the comorbidities, natural history of CU, and its subtypes in children and
identify predictors of resolution.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We followed a pediatric cohort with chronic urticaria
that presented with hives lasting at least 6 weeks between 2013 and 2015 at a single tertiary
care referral center.

EXPOSURES Data were collected on disease activity, comorbidities, physical triggers, BAT
results, complete blood cell count, C-reactive protein levels, thyroid-stimulating hormone
levels, and thyroid peroxidase antibodies.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Weassessed the rate of resolution (defined as absence of
hives for at least 1 year with no treatment) and the association with clinical and laboratory
markers.

RESULTS The cohort comprised 139 children younger than 18 years old. Thirty-one patients

(20%) had inducible urticaria, most commonly cold induced. Six children had autoimmune

comorbidity, such as thyroiditis and type 1 diabetes. Autoimmune disorders (24 patients

[17%]) and CU (17 patients [12%]) were common in family members. Positive BAT results

(CD63 levels > 1.8%) were found in 58% of patients. Patients with positive BAT results

(CD63 level >1.8%) were twice as likely to resolve after 1 year compared with negative BAT

results (hazard ratio [HR], 2.33; 95% Cl, 1.08-5.05). In contrast, presence of basophils

decreased the likelihood of resolution (HR, 0.40; 95% Cl, 0.20-0.99). No correlation with age

was found. Chronic urticaria resolved in 43 patients, with a rate of resolution of 10.3% per

year. Levels of CD63 higher than 1.8% and absence of basophils were associated with earlier Author Affiliations: Division of

Factors Associated With Chronic Urticaria in Children

hronic urticaria (CU) is defined by the occurrence of
wheals, angioedema, or both lasting more than 6 weeks.
Physical urticaria (PU) occurs when the CU is associated with a specific physical stimulus (eg, cold urticaria, solar
urticaria, delayed pressure urticaria, localized heat urticaria,
dermographic urticaria, or vibration urticaria’). The point
prevalence of CU is 0.5% to 1.0% of the general population,*®
and it affects 0.1% to 0.3% of children.’ Although to our know!ledge, no studies assessing the prevalence of CU in Canadians
had been published so far, assuming a similar 0.3% lifetime
prevalence, it is likely that more than 100 000 Canadian children are affected by CU.®
In 80% of CU cases, hives occur spontaneously, leading to the
diagnosis of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU).° While the exact pathogenesis of CSU remains to be elucidated, patients can
be divided into at least 2 subgroups: those whose disease is truly
idiopathic, and those who have an autoimmune CSU (40%-50%
of adults and children).!°"? The presence of autoantibodies that
are capable of inducing mast cell (and basophil) degranulation can
be established either in vivo with the use of the autologous serum skin test or in vitro with various methods, including the basophil activation test (BAT) using CD63 activation marker." Furthermore, studies of adult patients with CSU suggested that in an
additional 15% to 30% of cases of hives could be explained by an
“autoallergic” mast cell activation through thyroid peroxidase IgE
antibody binding the high-affinity IgE receptor."* In children, only
afew prospective studies suggested that autoimmune CSU affects
about half of pediatric CU cases in Europe!©” and Turkey, © while
in Thailand autoimmune CSU affects approximately 40% of
children.’” We recently addressed the use of BAT using CD63 expression for the assessment of CSU severity in Canadian children
and found that 58% of our pediatric CSU cohort had a positive BAT
result (defined as CD63 values >1.8%) suggesting autoimmune
urticaria.'® Furthermore, we demonstrated that BAT was significantly higher in patients with CSU compared with healthy volunteers and correlated positively with disease severity.
Chronic urticaria in adults is considered a self-limited disease, yet it resolves spontaneously within 5 years in only 30% to
55% of adult patients.'®?! However, data on the natural history
of CU and its subtypes in children are scarce. Furthermore, no
prognostic biomarkers have been identified up to this point.
The aim of this study was to establish a registry of pediatric patients with CU to assess clinical characteristics and the
presence of comorbidities associated with CU in children and
to determine the natural history of CU and identify factors associated with resolution.

Patients

The study protocol and consent forms were approved by the institutional review board of the McGill University Health Centre
(protocol No. 12-225) and were in accordance with the guiding
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from children’s parents or legal guardians prior
to conducting any study-related investigations. In addition, patients older than 7 years were requested to sign a consent form.

Key Points

Question What is the resolution rate of chronic urticaria in
children, and are there biomarkers that can predict resolution?

Findings Ina cohort of 139 children younger than 18 years, our
data demonstrated low (10%) yearly resolution rate of chronic
urticaria. Basopenia and positive results from a basophil activation
test (BAT) (CD63 level > 1.8%) were associated with higher
resolution rate

Meaning Biomarkers, including BAT results and basophil counts,
may help to prognosticate the natural history of chronic urticaria in
children.

Participants ages O to 17 years were recruited prospectively from
the urticaria and dermatology clinics at the Montreal Children’s
Hospital from December 2013 to December 2015. Patients were
not compensated for their participation.

Complete medical history was taken and physical examination were performed for each patient at the time of study
entry and during each follow-up visit. We defined CU by the
occurrence of wheals, angioedema, or both lasting more
than 6 weeks. Inducible urticarias were identified by proper
investigations (ie, suggestive history for physical triggers
and appropriate confirmatory provocation testing, as
recommended?”?). Other potential causes of urticaria (ie, food
and drug allergy and parasites) were identified by history and/or
confirmatory testing (a stool sample for ova and parasite identification was obtained at baseline in case of travel to an endemic area in the year prior to presentation with hives, presence of close contact with pets or suggestive symptoms). Data
were collected on personal and family history of comorbid conditions, including atopy (defined as the presence of asthma,
eczema, or food allergy diagnosed by a physician) and autoimmune diseases and history of medications use.

As part of the standard of care, all patients had a complete blood cell count (CBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level
measured at baseline.” In addition, serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and tryptase levels were obtained at baseline. Additional investigations (eg, antinuclear antibody serologic tests,
skin biopsy) were performed only if there were any clinical features suggestive of comorbid autoimmune disease or the diagnosis of CU was not clear. Disease severity was assessed using
weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7) (weekly average for the
previous 12 weeks) at each clinical follow-up visit as previously described.'*?%

Treatment regimen was based on the European Academy
of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Global Allergy and Asthma
European Network, European Dermatology Forum, and World
Allergy Organization recommendations.” All patients were prescribed initially a second-generation, nonsedating antihistamine, such as desloratadine or cetirizine, once daily, according to age recommendation for approximately 2 to 4 weeks,
and the dose was increased up to 4-fold of the recommended
initial dose after 2 to 4 weeks in presence of persistent symptoms. Those with persistent CU despite maximal dosage of antihistamines after 4 weeks were asked to contact the treating

physician to be evaluated and to potentially change or intensify the treatment regimen. Third-line treatment options included omalizumab and ketotifen.?*:?° Antiparasitic medications were given in case of positive stool culture results only.

Assessment of Basophil Activation and Thyroiditis

Basophil activation test using CD63 marker expression was performed. Values higher than 1.8% of basophil activation were
considered elevated, as previously described.'* In addition, levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, and IgG
thyroid peroxidase antibodies were assessed.

Assessment of Natural History of the Disease

Disease resolution was defined as absence of hives for at least
lyear without treatment (the date of resolution being the last
day of active hives) as described in previous studies.’ All patients were followed up prospectively and assessed for disease resolution. In case of loss to follow-up, patients were called
on an annual basis to verify if the disease was still persistent.

Statistical Considerations

Baseline characteristics were summarized using means (SDs)
or proportions as appropriate. Kaplan-Meier curves were used
to depict unadjusted time to resolution from disease onset per
100 patient-years. Multivariable Cox regression models were
used to determine factors associated with resolution (ie, demographic data, including age and sex; UAS7; angioedema; presence of comorbid autoimmune disorders; atopy; family history of hives; presence of inducible urticaria; and laboratory
characteristics, including CRP level, absolute basophil count,
and BAT findings. The latter 2 were characterized as dichotomous variables (absence of basophils vs levels that are detectable and CD63 levels >1.8% vs levels that are <1.8%, respectively). We assessed the effect of age both as continuous as well
as categorical variables (age ranges, 0-4 years old, 4-12 years
old, and 12-18 years old). We used SAS statistical software (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc) and R software (version 2.12.0;
R Foundation ) to conduct all statistical analyses.

Results

 

Demographic Data

A total of 139 consecutive children with CU were recruited
(Table 1). Our cohort did not include patients with recurrent angioedema and without wheals. There were no cases of refusal to
participate. The sex distribution was equal. Almost 70% of children (95) were white (non-Hispanic, non-Middle Eastern white).
The mean (SD) ageat disease onset was 6.7 (4.7) years [range, 0-17
years]. The mean duration of CU was 2.0 (1.8) years [range, 0.38.7 years]. The most common type of CU was CSU (108 [78.0%)]).
Twenty-two percent of patients (31) had inducible urticaria; of
those, approximately a third (11 patients) had CSU as well. The
most common subtype of inducible urticaria was cold-induced
urticaria (22 patients [15.8%]) followed by a cholinergic (9 [6.5%]),
sun-induced (3 [2.2%]), and delayed pressure (1 [0.7%]) urticarias. A quarter of patients had concomitant angioedema symptoms
(28% of patients with CSU). Almost all patients (132 [95%]) re

quired a treatment for their symptoms consisting of secondgeneration antihistamines alone or in resistant cases, in combination with ketotifen (13%) and/or antileukotriene (1.4%)
and/or omalizumab (5%).

Regarding comorbidities, the most common was atopy (39
patients [28.0%]) (mainly asthma or atopic dermatitis). Six patients were diagnosed as having a comorbid autoimmune disease: 2 with type 1 diabetes, 3 with autoimmune hypothyroidism, and 1 child with systemic lupus erythematosus. Five
children were known to have other, not related, chronic health
conditions (Table 1). Interestingly, in 24 children (17%) with CU
there was a familial history of autoimmune disease, with autoimmune thyroiditis being the most common (14 patients
[10%]). In 17 children (12%), 1 or more immediate family members had a history of CU.

Investigation Results

Most patients (126) had their blood drawn. In most patients,
the results were within normal limits (Table 2). Thyroid peroxidase antibodies were positive in 4 patients. Of those, 3 were
diagnosed as having Hashimoto thyroiditis and were treated
with thyroid replacement therapy. Thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were normal in all patients. A BAT analysis on this
cohort of patients was previously described and showed that
59 (57%) of them had positive findings suggesting autoimmune urticaria.’© Basophils were undetectable in 73 children
(60%). C-reactive protein levels were elevated in 10 patients
(8%), while 8 patients (6%) had peripheral blood eosinophilia
(none had met the criteria for hypereosinophilic syndrome).
In one of those patients, stool parasites were found, but urticaria recurred despite the antiparasitic treatment. Immunoglobulin E levels were high in 49 patients (40%), with amean
(SD) of 552.0 (1522.3) pg/L. (To convert IgE to milligrams per
liter, multiply by 0.001.) Serum tryptase was within normal
limits in all patients.

Natural History

There were 43 cases of resolution over 419 patient-years of follow-up since disease onset giving a resolution rate of 10.3 per
100 patient-years (Figure). Four patients were lost to followup, and their disease resolution could not be assessed. KaplanMeier curves display time to resolution by higher and lower
CD63 levels (Figure, A), and by lower and higher basophil
counts (Figure, B). In Cox regression models adjusted for age,
sex, and the presence of inducible forms, higher BAT scores,
and absence of basophiles were associated with earlier resolution of disease. Patients with positive BAT results (CD63 level
>1.8%) were twice as likely to resolve after 1 year compared with
negative BAT results (hazard ratio [HR], 2.33; 95% CI, 1.085.05). In contrast, presence of basophils decreased the likelihood of resolution (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.20-0.99). No correlation with age was found.

severity. However, most of our patients were treated with antihistamines and had a mild disease.

We assessed for possible predictors of resolution, including
clinical and laboratory parameters. Surprisingly, high BAT scores
and absence of basophils were associated with earlier spontaneous resolution of urticaria. Interestingly, those 2 parameters were
previously biologically linked; basopenia was observed mainly
in autoimmune subset of CSU and hypothesized to bea result of
recruitment of circulating basophils into the skin during disease
activity.?” To our knowledge, there is a paucity of studies assessing this associations in adult CSU and none in pediatric population to our knowledge. Kulthanan et al?* performed a retrospective medical record review of 337 adult patients with CSU, and
autoimmunity was assessed using the autologous serum skin test.
In their study, 56.5% of autoimmune CU cases resolved after 1.2
years (only 15 patients) compared with 34.5% of idiopathic forms
in 1 year.?° The reported trend seems in favor of earlier resolution in autoimmune cases; however, the small sample size and

different time denominators limit its interpretation. Another
study in an adult population with CU reported no association between autoimmune urticaria and probability of resolution.*° If
our findings are confirmed in further studies, it is possible that
the favorable prognosis associated with autoimmunity and CD63
level higher than 1.8% is related to the presence of transient viraland bacterial infections that induce autoantibody production.
Infections, especially viruses, are common in children and are
well accepted pathogenic players in up to 80% of cases of acute
urticaria.*!*3 Furthermore, acute viral infections in children and
adults have been proposed to be able to induce transient autoantibodies against self, owing to (1) mimicry between the virus
and self or (2) virus-induced cell apoptosis revealing a self neoantigen. Antibodies produced in such cases are usually low
titer and transient, but can be high titer, disease specific, and
pathogenic.** Clinical disease can occur when autoantibodies
bind and alter the function on a self-antigen or generate immune
complexes that lead to tissue damage. Clinical examples of such
interactions include but are not limited to Epstein-Barr virus and
systemic lupus erythematosus, hepatitis C virus and cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, mycoplasma, and cold agglutinins. Infectioninduced autoimmunity often resolves within months but can also
trigger a chronic disease.°>

Given that the cost of the BAT is approximately Can$2600
for 50 samples and an additional Can$150 for processing and
analyzing these samples (over an estimated time of 2 hours),
the cost per sample is estimated to be Can$55. Our findings suggest that such a cost may be justified to predict the risk of a
more chronic course.

Limitations

Our study has potential limitations. The CU resolution rate was
10.3 per 100 patient-years. Similar rates were reported in adult
and pediatric literature.7!3°” However, our center is a referral
center for CU and hence might represent pediatric populations
with more severe CU and not be applicable for CU cases seen in

more self-limited cases were likely missed. Hence, it is possible

that the 10% annual resolution rate found in our study could underestimate the natural history of CU cases in the general population. In addition, 4 patients were lost to follow-up and in almost
a third of cases laboratory data was missing. We did not assess
the presence of specific auto antibodies, and hence it is not clear
if specific autoantibodies may have an effect on prognosis.

Jay Frank Schamberg, MD—Beyond the Eponymous Disease

Kishore L. Jayakumar, BS; Sara S. Samimi, MD

Jay Frank Schamberg, MD (1870-1934), was an American dermatologist who made remarkable contributions as a clinician, scientist, and public health advocate. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania
School of Medicine in 1892. After studying dermatology in Europe, he
returned to Philadelphia, where he would live for the rest of his life.’

In 1901, Schamberg described 2 new conditions, one of which still
bears his name.’ The first was characterized ina case report of a 15-yearold boy with irregular patches resembling “cayenne pepper,” introducing a food analogy still used to describe the pigmented purpuric dermatosis now called Schamberg disease. The second was a seasonal pruritic
eruption. In 1909, this mysterious disease became an epidemic, affecting a yacht crew before spreading to other boats and buildings. Alarmed,
Philadelphia officials consulted Schamberg, who immediately recognized the condition as the one he had described 8 years earlier. Joseph
Goldberger, MD, of the US Public Health Service, collaborating with
Schamberg, skillfully identified the causative agent as an acarine mite
that had infested the straw mattresses of affected individuals.’ Although Goldberger named the condition Dermatitis schambergi, the label did not stick, and it is now typically known as grain itch.

In 1910, Schamberg became a professor of dermatology at Temple
University.’ One of his patients was the owner of the mite-ridden yacht,
P. A. B. Widener, who had psoriasis. In 1912, Widener contributed funding for Schamberg to establish a cutaneous research institute: Dermatological Research Laboratories (DRL). The DRL initially focused on psoriasis, but the outbreak of World War | in 1914 altered its course. Supply
of arsphenamine, the first effective antisyphilitic, from Germany to the
United States was drastically reduced.? Responding to the shortage,
Schamberg led his team to synthesize arsphenamine within a year, although a German patent limited its distribution. At his urging, various

JAMA Dermatology December 2017 Volume 153, Number 12

medical associations expressed support for the DRL's right to distribute
arsphenamine, and in 1917, Congress granted the Federal Trade Commission authority to license American citizens to operate foreignowned patents. With a license, Schamberg generously priced arsphenamine at only about one-fourth of its initial value, and funded additional
cutaneous research with the profits.?

Besides his clinical and scientific accomplishments, Schamberg was
active in public health. His experiences in treating patients with smallpox led him to coauthor the treatise Acute Contagious Diseases (1905)
and to advocate staunchly for mandatory vaccination, earning him the
ire of many antivaccinationists.?

In1918, he received professorships at Jefferson Medical College and
his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania. From 1920 to 1921, he
served as president of the American Dermatological Association.? Although today Schamberg is likely best known for his 1901 case report,
his humanitarianism and commitment to advancing dermatology should
continue to inspire us.
