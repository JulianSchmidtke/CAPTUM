Abstract

 

 

Background: Omalizumab is approved in the UK as add-on treatment for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in
patients with inadequate response to H,-antihistamines. Ciclosporin is an established but unlicensed 3rd line option
for CSU. Two parallel retrospective observational studies were conducted to describe outcomes of treatment and
adverse events with omalizumab or ciclosporin for CSU treatment.

Methods: Data from UK specialist centres prescribing omalizumab (five centres) or ciclosporin (three centres) in CSU
patients were collected from hospital records by clinical staff and pooled for analysis.

Results: Forty-six patients prescribed omalizumab and 72 patients prescribed ciclosporin were included. Twenty-two
(48%) omalizumab-treated patients had paired Urticaria Activity Scores (UAS7), showing a 25.4 point improvement
during treatment (P < 0.0001). Paired Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) was available in 28 (61%) omalizumabtreated and 17 (24%) ciclosporin-treated patients. At least a 75% improvement in DLQI score was observed in 79% of
omalizumab-treated and 41% of ciclosporin-treated patients, and 65% of omalizumab-treated patients had complete
resolution of their quality-of-life impairment (DLQ| 0-1) versus 21% of ciclosporin-treated patients. Clinician comments reported symptom clearance in 15/36 (42%) omalizumab-treated and 10/60 (17%) ciclosporin-treated patients.
Proportions of patients with adverse events were similar but those for omalizumab resembled CSU symptoms, making causality assignment difficult, whereas those for ciclosporin were consistent with its known adverse effect profile.

Conclusions: Validated patient-reported measures of disease severity and quality of life should be used routinely
in CSU management. Based on clinician comments and DLQI scores, symptoms and quality of life showed a greater
improvement in the omalizumab-treated cohort than in the ciclosporin-treated cohort.

Background

In chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), non-sedating
H,-antihistamines are the treatment of first choice, aiming for complete symptom resolution [1, 2]. However,

treatment with licensed doses relieves symptoms effectively in fewer than 50% of patients [3]. In cases of
non-response, recent European guidelines recommend
increasing H,-antihistamine dose up to four times the
licensed dose [1], but approximately one-third of patients
remain antihistamine resistant [4]. The recommended
treatment options in patients unresponsive to highdose H,-antihistamines are ciclosporin, omalizumab

or montelukast [1]. Other strategies adopted in clinical practice include a change of H,-antihistamine, using
a combination of H,- and H,-antihistamines, or addition of dapsone or methotrexate [1]. Although supported by clinical guidelines and some clinical studies,
all second and third-line options, with the exception of
omalizumab, are unlicensed for CSU. Omalizumab is a
recombinant humanized monoclonal anti-IgE antibody
which binds to the Fc region of IgE. By sequestering free
IgE, it may also indirectly downregulate FcRI receptors
on mast cells and basophils, reducing histamine release
potential and hence CSU symptoms [5], however the
specific mode of action of omalizumab in CSU is currently unknown. In 2014 omalizumab (300 mg by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks) was licensed as add-on
therapy for the treatment of CSU in adult and adolescent
(12 years and above) patients with inadequate response
to H,-antihistamine treatment [6], following studies
which demonstrated its efficacy and safety in this group
of patients [7-9].

The aim of this investigation was to gather UK real
world evidence of third-line treatment options for CSU
to facilitate clinical treatment decision making. We conducted two parallel multicentre retrospective case note
review studies. In the first study we reviewed patients
treated with omalizumab for CSU and in the second, parallel study, we reviewed patients treated with ciclosporin
for CSU. We report here the results of both studies,
describing the characteristics of patients treated, and the
dosing patterns, outcomes and adverse events associated
with these treatments.

Methods

Study sites were identified through clinicians with a specialist interest in CSU, treating patients in dermatology
or immunology services. The omalizumab study was
conducted in five UK specialist tertiary centres (4 Dermatology, 1 Immunology). The ciclosporin study was
conducted in 3 of these 5 centres (2 Dermatology, 1
Immunology).

Patients’ clinical records were reviewed retrospectively by the responsible clinicians and ethical approval
for both studies was covered by UK regulations for retrospective medical records review [10]. Research governance approval was obtained for study conduct at each
participating centre.

For the present investigation, the omalizumab study
comprised consecutive eligible patients first prescribed
omalizumab for any form of CU (n = 55) between
19/10/09 and 14/02/14 without selective sampling and
we present here those with CSU (n = 46). The eligibility
period was pre-licence and omalizumab was accessed via
individual funding requests (IFR). The ciclosporin study

Page 2 of 11

included consecutive adult patients who received ciclosporin for CSU treatment between 8/08/08 and 31/12/12.
Patients with co-existing asthma or atopic eczema were
excluded to avoid uncertainty over the indication for prescribing ciclosporin.

All clinical staff were trained in the study requirements
and a standardised data collection form and data collection guidelines were used to ensure consistency of methodology across all centres for each study.

The dataset for each study was collected by members of
the clinical team from patients’ clinical records, including paper case-notes and electronic hospital databases.
Patient and disease baseline characteristics [age, sex,
symptoms and severity of CSU, weekly Urticaria Activity
Score (UAS7), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)
score, presence of angioedema and severity score, weight,
symptom onset and diagnosis dates, co-morbidities and
previous CSU medications] were collected from the time
of omalizumab/ciclosporin initiation.

The UAS7 is a validated patient reported scoring system [1], which assesses intensity of pruritus (0 = none;
1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = intense) and number of
wheals (0 = none; 1 = 1-20 wheals; 2 = 20-50 wheals;
3 = 50+ wheals or large confluent areas of wheals)
over 24 h. Daily UAS scores (range 0-6 points/day) are
summed over 7 days to create the weekly UAS7 (range
0-42), with higher scores reflecting higher disease
activity. The DLQI is a patient-reported validated questionnaire [11] which measures the health-related quality of life (QoL) of adults suffering from a skin disease
(range 0-30), with higher scores meaning greater QoL
impairment.

Dosing patterns of omalizumab/ciclosporin, outcomes
(routinely-administered UAS7, DLQI scores, clinician’s
assessments of symptom resolution and adverse events)
were collected from the date of omalizumab/ciclosporin
initiation to the date of data collection, irrespective of the
treatment duration. Disease response according to clinician’s assessment documented in the medical record was
classified as either ‘clear of symptoms, ‘improved symptoms’ or ‘non-responder’ (including patients with no
change or worsening of CSU); the best response documented during treatment was recorded as the study outcome measure. Adverse events were extracted from the
hospital case notes and patient correspondence (primary
care notes were not available). The date, severity, seriousness and assessment of causality of each adverse event
were recorded using a consistent set of coded response
options.

Analyses were conducted with the available data and
the number available for each analysis is stated where
data were absent from the clinical record; no imputation
of missing data was undertaken.

Results

Patients

The baseline characteristics of the patients included in
the omalizumab and ciclosporin studies are presented
in Table 1. In the omalizumab study, of the 46 patients
with CSU (mean age 43.3 years; SD 13.1), 36 (78%) were
female. Thirty-six (78%) patients had CSU and 10 (22%)
had CSU concurrent with chronic inducible urticaria
(CIndU; 7 pressure urticaria, 3 dermographism); four
also had documented features of urticarial vasculitis
(UV). Angioedema was recorded for 38 (83%) patients;
31 (86%) of those with CSU only and 7 (70%) of those
with CSU + CIndU (see Table 1). The ciclosporin study
included 72 patients with CSU (mean age 40.5 years;
SD 12.8), of whom 61 (85%) were female. Among these,
66 (92%) had a diagnosis of CSU only, while 6 (8%) had
CSU + ClIndU (three dermographism, two delayed
pressure urticaria, one symptomatic dermographism/
delayed pressure urticaria and aquagenic pruritus). Fifty
patients (69%) had a recorded history of angioedema
(see Table 1).

Dosing

Twenty-four (52%) omalizumab-treated patients were
initiated on 150 mg and 20 (43%) on 300 mg omalizumab.
Eight (17%) patients increased the dose from 150 mg to
a maximum of 300 mg and 4 (9%) patients reduced the
dose from 300 mg. Dosing frequency was 4 weekly in 32
patients, 3 weekly in one patient, 2 weekly in six patients
and >4 weekly in six patients (one patient received only
one dose). Omalizumab treatment had been discontinued in 20 patients (43%) at the time of data collection; the
reasons for withdrawal were not documented.

The median (range) duration of ciclosporin treatment
was 4.8 (0.2—67.1) months overall, 4.4 (0.2—67.1) months
for complete courses and 28.1 (17.3-38.6) months for
ongoing courses at data collection. The mean daily dose
of ciclosporin was 174 mg (SD 85.6). The dose in mg/
kg could be calculated for 37 patients; 3 mg/kg was the
most common starting dose [8/37 patients (22%)] and
4 mg/kg was the most common maximum dose [10/37
patients (27%)]. During ciclosporin therapy, 27 (38%)
patients remained on a constant dose, 15 (21%) increased
dose, 13 (18%) decreased dose, 7 (10%) increased then
decreased dose, 4 (6%) decreased then increased dose
and 6 (8%) had other patterns of dose changes. Ciclosporin had been discontinued in 67 (93%) patients at the
time of data collection, with 25 (35%) stopping within
3 months of initiation. Reasons for ciclosporin withdrawal were given for 49/67 (73%) patients, indicating
lack of benefit in 23/49 patients (46%), intolerance in
13/49 (26%), successful treatment in 11/49 (22%) and
other reasons in 3 (6%).

Treatment response

Omalizumab study

Clinician-documented comments on the best response
to omalizumab treatment were available for 36 (78%)
patients, of whom 15 (42%) were clear of symptoms,
12 (33%) had some improvement and 9 (25%) had not
responded.

The UAS7 score was available for 27 patients at baseline [mean weekly UAS7 27.5 (SD 10.4)]. UAS7 was available for 28 patients at some time following omalizumab
initiation [mean UAS7 3.1 (SD 6.3)], and of these 19
(68%) achieved a score of 0 (itch/hives free). The mean
weekly UAS7 score for 19 patients with UAS7 recorded
at 3 months (+1 month) following omalizumab initiation was 5.8 (SD 9.8). In the 22 patients with paired UAS7
scores, the mean weekly score decreased by 25.4 (SD
12.5) points (P < 0.0001, paired t test) following omalizumab initiation, as shown in Figure 1. The mean of the
patients’ percentage improvements was 85%. A reduction
in UAS7 score of at least 75% from baseline was observed
in 17/22 (77%) patients and a reduction of at least 90% in
15/22 (68%), see Figure 2.

The impact of CSU on QoL was measured using the
DLQI in 32 patients at baseline [mean score 19.5 (SD
5.2)]. DLQI was available in 31 patients at some time
during omalizumab treatment [mean score 3.2 (SD 5.2)],
and of these 20 (65%) achieved a DLQI score of 0-1 (no
impact of disease on QoL). In the 28 patients with paired
scores, the mean DLQI score decreased by 16.4 (SD 9.1)
points (P < 0.0001, paired t test) following omalizumab
initiation, as shown in Figure 3. The mean of the patients’
percentage improvements was 80%. An improvement
of at least 75% in DLQI was observed in 22/28 (79%)
patients and an improvement of at least 90% in 18/28
(64%; see Figure 2).

 

Ciclosporin study

The best response to ciclosporin according to cliniciandocumented comments [available for 60 (83%) patients]
was clear of symptoms in 10 (17%), improved in 33 (55%)
and no response in 17 (28%) patients. The UAS7 score
was not used to assess response to ciclosporin.

DLQI was measured in 20 patients at baseline [mean
score 17.4 (SD 6.6)]. DLQI score was available at some
time during ciclosporin treatment in 19 patients [mean
score 8.5 (SD 7.3)], and of these 4 (21%) achieved a
DLQI score of 0-1. In the 17 patients with paired DLQI
scores, mean score decreased by 8.9 (SD 9.2) points
(P = 0.0005, paired t test), as shown in Figure 4. The
mean of the patients’ percentage improvements was 45%.
An improvement in DLQI of at least 75% was observed in
7/17 (41%) patients and an improvement of at least 90%
in 3/17 (18%; see Figure 2).

Adverse events

Omalizumab study

Potential adverse events were documented during omalizumab treatment for 17 (37%) patients, with a total of
36 events (Table 2). The most common adverse events
recorded were skin reactions (eight reports from four

patients), angioedema (six reports from three patients),
and ‘anaphylaxis’ (three reports from two patients).
Overall 35 events were clinician-assessed for severity and
causal relationship with omalizumab and judged to be
mild in 10 (29%), moderate in 19 (54%) severe in 4 (11%)

relationship with omalizumab was recorded in 20 (57%),
with 6 (17%) unrelated and 9 (26%) unknown. Episodes
of anaphylaxis were reviewed in detail. One episode of
‘anaphylaxis’ was clinician-rated as ‘moderate’ in severity, and ‘possibly related’ to omalizumab. The episode
occurred 2.5 h after omalizumab administration and
involved shortness of breath, tongue angioedema and
urticaria (blood pressure and pulse were normal, tryptase
was not measured), which responded to oxygen, antihistamine, hydrocortisone and self-administered adrenaline
in 15 min and the patient was not admitted to hospital.
A second episode in the same patient also occurred on
the day of omalizumab dosing and was clinician-rated
as ‘severe’ and ‘possibly related’ to omalizumab. On this

occasion the patient was admitted to hospital overnight;
tryptase was slightly raised at 15.5 ng/ml acutely (normal < 11.4 ng/ml) and 13.4 ng/ml the next day. Although
both episodes in this patient were documented as ‘possibly related’ to omalizumab, the patient had a history of
complex and severe CSU, including recurrent ‘anaphylaxis’ prior to omalizumab, which was incompletely controlled by the therapy. In our opinion the two episodes
of ‘anaphylaxis’ in this patient were most likely to have
been an exacerbation of the underlying CSU. The third
episode of reported anaphylaxis, in a different patient,
also occurred on the day of omalizumab injection, and
was clinician-rated as ‘severe: However, we consider this
episode not to be consistent with anaphylaxis, although

ossibly related to omalizumab, based on reviewing the
case in detail (symptoms: sharp joint pains and nausea,
without severe shortness of breath, hypotension, hives or
angioedema; treated by hospital admission for fluids and
ydrocortisone). Omalizumab treatment was continued
in all three cases.

 

Ciclosporin study

Potential adverse events were documented during ciclosporin treatment for 28 (39%) patients, with 49 episodes
(Table 2). The most commonly reported adverse events
were hypertension (eight reports), fatigue/tiredness (six

reports), gastrointestinal problems (four reports) and
headache (four reports). Of the 49 events, 45 were clinician-assessed for severity, with 24 (53%) rated mild, 16
(36%) moderate, 3 (7%) severe and 2 (4%) not applicable
(pregnancy). Thirty (61%) were judged ‘possibly related’
to ciclosporin, 4 (8%) unrelated and 15 (31%) unknown.

Discussion

These two real world multicentre retrospective observational studies of the treatment of CSU, with either ciclosporin or omalizumab, were carried out in patients for
whom early treatment options had failed. The patients

were similar in the two studies with respect to age and
gender distributions and consistent with the wider population of patients with CSU [12] and patients included
in clinical trials of omalizumab [7-9]. The recorded
prevalence of unsolicited psychiatric co-morbidities was
much lower in both studies than the 30-50% reported
elsewhere in patients with CSU [13, 14]. This disparity is
possibly due to incomplete recording of psychiatric morbidity and could suggest that this co-morbidity is underassessed in CSU care in routine practice.

There was considerable variability in initial ciclosporin
dosing in the present study and reasons for dose changes
were not recorded. Guidelines do not recommend a dose
of ciclosporin in CSU but initiating patients on a low
dose and up-titrating is an approach that has been advocated to minimise adverse effects while preserving efficacy [15]. Alternatively, studies have used doses of up to
4 mg/kg [16], with 3 mg/kg commonly reported as being
effective and tolerable [17] even for long periods [18].
Staged dose reductions from starting doses of 3-4 mg/kg
are standard dermatology clinical practice in response to
adverse effects. The approach to ciclosporin dosing in the
present study (either starting high or starting low) varied
between centres rather than between individual patients
and seemed to reflect clinician preference.

Due to the absence of any disease severity scores for
ciclosporin-treated patients the baseline severity of CSU
in the two studies cannot be directly compared, although
DLQI, which has been shown to correlate well with
UAS7 in patients with CSU [19] was similar at baseline
for patients in the two studies. The omalizumab-treated
patients in the present study appeared to be characteristic of a more severe disease group as concurrent CSU and
ClIndU was more prevalent, angioedema more frequent,
and more patients had co-morbidities compared with
the ciclosporin-treated patients. However, we acknowledge that this may reflect more thorough documentation
of medical history in order to obtain omalizumab funding. Omalizumab was also initiated later after initial CSU
diagnosis than ciclosporin and most omalizumab-treated
patients had tried, and were refractory to, third-line
immunosuppressants (Table 1), reflecting the unlicensed
status and restricted funding of omalizumab for CSU in
the studied period. Thus it is likely that a more severe
group was measured in the omalizumab study and as a
consequence, direct comparisons of outcomes between
the studies of omalizumab and ciclosporin are not
possible.

Although formal direct comparison of treatment
outcomes is not possible, we can infer some aspects
of effectiveness based on the similar baseline DLQI
in both groups. The observed improvement in mean
DLQI appeared to be greater in patients treated with

Page 9 of 11

omalizumab compared with ciclosporin-treated patients,
with considerably more omalizumab-treated patients
achieving a 75% reduction in DLQI compared with ciclosporin-treated patients (79 and 41%, respectively). The
difference was even greater (65 and 18% respectively) in
the proportions achieving a 90% reduction in DLQL.

Documented clinicians’ comments were a more widely
available assessment of response to treatment. When
reported responses were evaluated categorised as ‘clear
of symptoms, ‘improved symptoms’ or ‘no response; the
data suggested that the response was more often comlete, meeting the recommended goal of CSU treatment
1] with omalizumab treatment (42% ‘clear of symptoms’)
than with ciclosporin treatment (17% ‘clear of symptoms’). However, caution needs to be exerted in interretation of these comments due to the subjective nature
of the data, and we advocate use of systematic, validated
measures of disease severity for all patients with CSU to
elp clinical teams to monitor optimal disease control
by providing consistent outcomes for each treatment
rescribed.
Further evidence of the effectiveness of omalizumab in
this severely affected cohort was available from patientreported changes in disease severity (UAS7), with over
three quarters (77%) of evaluable omalizumab-treated
patients achieving a 75% reduction in UAS7 score and
68% achieving a UAS7 score of 0 (itch and hives free). As
this retrospective study was dependent on the routine
schedule of clinic visits and clinical practice with respect
to formal disease assessment, the data do not allow analysis of the speed of response to omalizumab as the proportion of patients with UAS7 scores even at 3 months
was small. However, data from Phase III trials [7-9] and
observational studies [20, 21] indicate that responses are
rapid, being seen in 53-57% of cases 1 week after the first
injection of omalizumab. Although UAS7 was not used
to monitor efficacy of ciclosporin treatment, it is notable
that 46% of 50 reasons given for stopping ciclosporin in
49 patients, were related to lack of efficacy.

Tolerability appears similar for both drugs, as the overall proportions of patients with documented adverse
events were similar (37 and 39% for omalizumab and
ciclosporin respectively). There was a broader range of
adverse events associated with ciclosporin than with
omalizumab and the ciclosporin adverse events reflected
its known safety profile. It is notable that many adverse
events recorded during omalizumab treatment closely
resemble the symptoms of CSU itself, exemplified by
the patient with two reported episodes of ‘anaphylaxis’
following omalizumab dosing, which were difficult to
separate from the prior history of ‘anaphylaxis’ which
was a feature of the CSU in that individual. This observation highlights the difficulty in differentiating natural

 
Savic et al. All Asth Clin Immun (2015) 11:21

fluctuations in disease symptoms from adverse events
when retrospectively interpreting medical records
originally made for clinical care rather than for medical
research. As these were small retrospective observational
studies and formal recording of adverse events was not
of the same standard as required by prospective trials,
these data need to be interpreted with caution in association with the broader evidence of tolerability and safety
of both drugs.

Conclusions

It is clear from the present real world data that both
omalizumab and ciclosporin treatment were associated
with a significant improvement in QoL in patients with
CSU. Recently updated European guidelines recommend
both ciclosporin and omalizumab as 3rd line CSU treatment options [1]. However, data from these two small
real world studies indicate a greater proportion of omalizumab-treated patients achieved at least a 75 and 90%
improvement in DLQI compared with ciclosporin-treated
patients, suggesting omalizumab treatment is more effective in improving patient QoL. The clinician-documented
assessment of response to treatment suggested that more
omalizumab-treated than ciclosporin-treated patients
achieved clearance of symptoms. Omalizumab was associated with a significant reduction in disease activity in
line with findings from recently published Phase III studies and case series [7—9, 19, 20]. The results of these two
retrospective observational studies were not directly comparable due to differences between the patient cohorts
and lack of consistently recorded validated measures of
disease. Adoption of a uniform approach to documentation of CSU disease severity at regular time points, using
validated tools, would facilitate comparison of different
treatment options and provide evidence for the optimum
management of patients with CSU. Despite the limitations of the studies reported here, in the absence of larger
prospective studies, these real world data will be beneficial for clinicians in making informed decisions between
third-line treatment options for CSU until stronger evidence becomes available.
