ABSTRACT

Introduction: Omalizumab is indicated for the
treatment of patients affected by chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) refractory to antihistamines. The aim of this study was to assess the
efficacy, safety, and recurrence of symptoms in
a real-life experience of omalizumab as an addon therapy for H)-antihistamine-refractory CSU
patients (refractory CSU).

Methods: A retrospective review of the clinical
records of all refractory CSU treated with omalizumab at our dermatology center from June
2014 to April 2017 was performed. Patients
previously treated with second-generation
antihistamines at a fourfold increased dose
without clinical responses at 4 weeks of treatment were selected. Omalizumab was administered at a single dosage of 300 mg every 4 weeks

for 6months. Disease severity was assessed
using the 7-day Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7).
Results: Eighteen patients (14 women; mean
age 51 years, range 25-74) were enrolled. Mean
UAS7 at baseline was 27.3 (range 15-38).
Symptoms improved in all patients at 4 weeks
(UAS7 = 16.1, range 0-36). Treatment was
completed in 17 patients (94.4%), and among
these, a complete response (UAS7 = 0) was registered in 10 patients (58.8%). Adverse events
included thrombocytopenia in 1 patient (5.6%)
at 16weeks; therapy was suspended after
20 weeks and the complication was resolved,
resulting in a freedom from major adverse
events of 94.4%. Symptom recurrence occurred
in 3 patients (17.6%) at 4, 5, and 7 months from
the end of the primary therapy. Retreatment
with omalizumab was successful without any
adverse effects. Mean follow-up was 9.5 months
(range 1-28).

Conclusion: Add-on omalizumab therapy for
refractory CSU in a real-life setting seems to be
effective and safe with a relatively low incidence
of symptom recurrence. Further research should
investigate personalized omalizumab treatment
dosages and administration intervals, and the
identification of biomarkers for future treatment algorithms.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), also
called chronic idiopathic urticaria, affects
around 0.5-1% of the global population at any
given time [1]. H,-antihistamine-refractory CSU
(refractory CSU) has been previously defined as
uncontrolled symptoms (persisting of pruritus
and wheals) for at least 6 weeks [2]. CSU more
commonly affects women and is characterized
by the spontaneous appearance of itchy hives,
with or without angioedema, persisting for at
least 6 weeks [2]. Generally, this chronic disease
has a duration of 1-5 years, rarely persists for up
to SO years, and it is associated with patient
referred reduced quality of life [1, 2].

The EAACI/GA*LEN/EDF/WAO urticaria
guidelines’ treatment objective is the complete
resolution of signs and relief of symptoms as
quickly as possible, improving patients’ quality
of life in a three-step treatment algorithm [2].
The first choice treatment is second-generation
Hy-antihistamines in a single administration,
and in the cases of inadequate responsive,
guidelines suggest a second-line treatment of
increasing dosages, up to four times the recommended primary dose (currently an off-label
treatment) [2]. The recommended third-line
treatment includes add-on therapy of cyclosporine or montelukast (currently unlicensed for
CSU) [2] or omalizumab, a humanized monoclonal anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody,
which is the only approved add-on therapy for
refractory CSU [3, 4]. In the ASTERIA I, ASTERIA
Il, and GLACIAL pivotal randomized clinical
trials, omalizumab, at various single doses
(ranging from 75 to 300 mg) every 4 weeks for 3
or 6months, demonstrated its efficacy and
safety for the treatment of CSU, with significant
improvements in the Itching Score and 7-day
Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7), compared to
placebo [5-7]. Current EAACI/GA?LEN/EDE/
WAO urticaria guidelines recommend a 300 mg
dose [2].

In clinical settings, the treatment of refractory CSU with omalizumab has been shown to
be similar to, or in some cases even better than,
those reported by the pivotal randomized controlled trials [S-11]. Many previous studies have

4 Adis

Dermatol Ther (Heidelb) (2018) 8:291-301

included CSU with other forms of urticaria,
various dosages, and high variability of evaluation instruments. We present a retrospective
clinical analysis of the effects of omalizumab in
a homogeneous cohort of CSU patients, following a strict protocol of a single dosage of
300 mg every 4 weeks, measured according to
the UAS7.

METHODS

A retrospective analysis selected all consecutive
refractory CSU, subsequently treated with
omalizumab, at our dermatology center from
June 2014 to April 2017. All patients selected in
this study provided written, informed consent
and were previously treated with second-generation antihistamines at a fourfold increased
dose without clinical responses at 4 weeks of
treatment. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, good
clinical practice, and all applicable laws and
regulations. Exclusion criteria included all
patients who tested positive to the FricTest®
(Moxie GmbH, Berlin, Germany) and TempTest® (Khazaka Electronic, K6ln, Germany) for
the evaluation of physical/inducible urticaria.
Data analyzed included patient demographic
and clinical variables. A complete laboratory
investigation including immunologic tests (immunoglobulins, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear
factor, and organ-specific antibodies), IgE,
serum tryptase, p-dimer, and vitamin D was
performed at baseline. Further, autologous
serum skin test (ASST), a simple in vivo clinical
test for the detection of basophil histamine-releasing activity, was also performed at baseline,
following suspension of antihistamine therapy
for at least 7 days.

According to current guidelines, omalizumab was subcutaneously administered at a
single dose of 300 mg (independent of patient
body weight or serum IgE level), and repeated
every 4 weeks for 6 months. Disease severity was
assessed using the UAS7 at baseline (prior to
omalizumab administration) and at 1, 4, 12, 16,
20, and 24 weeks during the treatment cycle,
and every 8weeks after the final therapy
administration. Routine laboratory
Dermatol Ther (Heidelb) (2018) 8:291-301

investigations were also repeated at 4, 12, 16,
20, and 24 weeks after treatment initiation.

The UAS7 is the sum of the average daily
UAS, which is a composite score of itch severity
and hive count, over 7 days (range 0-42) [2, 12].
Response was classified according to UAS7 as
complete (UAS7=0), good (1 < UAS7 < 6),
partial (6 < UAS7 < UAS7 at baseline) , and no
response (UAS7 > UAS7 at baseline) [2, 12].

Patient relapse was considered a new
increase in UAS7 compared to the UAS7 recorded at 24 weeks of treatment with omalizumab.
Patients with relapse were prescribed a second
omalizumab add-on therapy cycle, of a single
administration of 300mg, repeated every
4 weeks for 5 months, according to the national
protocol from the Ministry of Health. UAS7 was
repeated prior to the second therapy cycle at
baseline and 1, 4, 12, 16, and 20 weeks, while
routine laboratory investigations were performed at 4, 12, 16, and 20 weeks.

Statistical analysis was performed using
STATA® software version 14 (StataCorp. 2015.
Stata Statistical Software: Release 14. College
Station, TX: StataCorp LP.). Analysis included
the Student’s ttest to compare continuous
variables. Margin statistics was used to estimate
adjusted predictions and marginal effects after a
linear regression based on a previously fitted
model. The model considered that the values of
UAS7 were fixed among patients during the first
and second cycles of omalizumab administration. For all tests, a p< 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

RESULTS

The study population comprised 18 patients
with refractory CSU. Mean age of our patient
population was 50.9 years (range 25-74) and the
majority were female (14 cases, 77.8%). All
patients had persistence of symptoms for at
least 12 months (in two cases for over 10 years)
and none reported angioedema. One patient
had a history of breast cancer (3 years prior)
treated with total mastectomy and chemotherapy. Demographic data, comorbidities, and
concomitant and previous medications of the
patients are reported in Table 1.

The mean serum levels were IgE 174.2 IU/ml
(range 1-1560), serum tryptase 5.7 g/l (range
2.7-9.4), b-dimer 385.3 ng/ml (range 66-1823),
vitamin D 15.5 ng/ml (range 7-25.7). ASST was
positive in only 2 patients (11.1%) who
achieved the latest and worst partial response,
while anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (anti-Tg)
and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (antiTPO) were detected in 3 patients (16.7%) with
known Hashimoto thyroiditis. The values of all
other laboratory investigations performed at
baseline were within normal ranges.

Almost all patients had improved symptoms
after the first dose of omalizumab at 4 weeks, with
UAS7 16.1 (range 0-36) compared to baseline 27.3
(range 15-38), and orally administered prednisone for symptom management was therefore
not required. The average UAS7 continued to
improve during the first treatment cycle, which
was completed in 17 patients (94.4%) with UAS7
8.3 (range 0-35) at 24 weeks. Among these
patients, a complete response was registered in 10
(58.8%), a good response in 1 patient (5.9%), a
partial response in 4 patients (23.5%), and no
response in 2 patients (11.8%) (Fig. 1).

A major adverse event was registered: the
routine laboratory investigations revealed at
16 weeks the progressive onset of thrombocytopenia in 1 patient (5.6%) with a history of
breast cancer. A complete response to CSU was
registered at 20 weeks, and omalizumab drug
administration was interrupted. The thrombocytopenia resolved and the patient dropped out
of the study. Freedom from major adverse
events was 94.4%. During the treatment period,
three minor adverse events were registered in
three patients: asthenia, slight arthralgia, and
mild hypertransaminasemia. These events did
not provoke omalizumab therapy interruption.

Symptom recurrence was registered in 3
patients (17.6%) at 4, 5, and 7 months following
initial omalizumab therapy, respectively.
Retreatment was successful with a complete
response for all patients without any reported
adverse effects or laboratory alterations (Fig. 2).

The average follow-up was 9.5 months
(range 1-28).

DISCUSSION

Omalizumab has an established safety profile,
approved for treatment of asthma in the USA
(2003) and in the European Union (2005), and for
the treatment of CSU in 2014 in both continents
[3, 4]. Large multicenter, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled phase III trials (ASTERIA
I, ASTERIA II, and GLACIAL) have shown that
omalizumab significantly improved urticaria outcomes compared with placebo in patients with
CSU [5-7]. However, none of the currently theoties, alone or in combination, fully account for the
pattern of symptom improvement seen with
omalizumab [13] and, therefore, additional
research seems justified in order to understand its
definitive mechanism of action and to further
clarify its involvement in relieving CSU symptoms.

The licensed dosage for omalizumab for
refractory CSU in Europe is 300mg _ every
4 weeks [3], while in the USA is either 150 or

300mg every 4weeks [4]. In the case of
angioedema, only the dosage of 300 mg every
4 weeks has been proven to be effective [6].
Currently, the licensed dosage in Italy is 300 mg
every 4 weeks over a 6-month period, and in the
case of disease recurrence, a minimum of
8 weeks suspension from omalizumab is obligatory, and then it can be prescribed again for a
further 5 months only. This schedule (6 months
treatment, 8 weeks suspension, and 5 months
therapy) can be repeated for eventual relapses;
however, this de novo treatment is considered
off-label.

Response patterns following omalizumab
treatment of CSU patients in the three clinical
trials (ASTERIA I, ASTERIA II, and GLACIAL)
were investigated in a retrospective analysis,
which demonstrated earlier and more sustained
response in patients receiving 300mg dose
compared to patients receiving 75 or 150mg
doses or placebo [14]. Some CSU patients
respond to treatment more quickly than others
and for this reason two different categories of
“omalizumab responders” have been described
[14]. Proposed classifications included “fast
responders” for those who responded within
4-6 weeks, while “slow responders” are those
who respond more gradually, from 12 to
16 weeks of treatment. However, an analysis of
response patterns revealed that “slow responders” may still respond even after 24 weeks,

while some “fast responders” may respond even
within 1 week of treatment [14]. In a retrospective analysis of patients treated in a clinical
setting, a complete response was reported in
57% of patients within 1 week, escalating to
86% of patients within 4 weeks [8]. We suggest
that the response patterns of patients to omalizumab therapy may contribute to the understanding of the actions and pathophysiological
mechanisms of the disease, providing essential
information for future personalized therapeutic
approaches. Currently, there are no established
biomarkers available to predict the extent and
course of changes in urticaria disease activity in
response to therapy.

The current study reports a complete and
good response (UAS7 < 6) in 64.7%, which
compares well with the values from the

ASTERIA I and II studies of 58.8% and GLACIAL
of 52.4% [5-7]. Complete response achieved in
58.8% in the current study was considerably
higher than the ASTERIA I and II 40% rates, and
the GLACIAL 33.7% [5-7]. A study of 110
patients also provided strong evidence for the
efficacy of omalizumab, reporting outstanding
results of a complete or significant response in
81.8%, with 60% interrupting concomitant
medications, and recurrence in 80.9% [11].
However, different doses and administration
protocols were used in this study.

Song et al. reported a similar complete
response rate (62.5%) to the current study in their
study of 16 patients [15]. Comparison with other
retrospective studies is difficult given the use of
subjective methods of evaluation to show categorical responses to omalizumab [9, 11, 16], many

physicians rely on their own experience and
clinical judgment to assess disease activity [16],
and differing outcome presentations [12]. Despite

4 Adis

the EAACI/GA7LEN/EDF/WAO urticaria guideline recommendation of UAS7 for disease assessment [2], a systematic review referenced the use of
UAS7 in only 6 of the included 26 randomized
controlled trials dedicated to CSU [17]. The most
common tools used by physicians to assess treatment response include the UAS7 [2], Angioedema
Activity Score (AAS) [18], the Urticaria Control
Test (UCT) [19], and specific disease quality of life
questionnaires [Chronic Urticaria-Quality of Life
Questionnaire (CU-Q,0L) and AngioedemaQuality of Life Questionnaire (AE-QoL)] [12]. We
suggest that future guidelines should propose
UAS7 for the assessment of CSU patients with
wheals, AAS for CSU patients with angioedema,
and both scores for CSU patients with wheals and
angioedema. Further, in many CSU patients disease activity and quality of life impairment are
poorly correlated [12]. Therefore, UAS7 and/or
AAS should be used together with specific disease
quality of life questionnaires.

Successful alternative dosages of omalizumab have also been reported in small case
Dermatol Ther (Heidelb) (2018) 8:291-301

series: low dosages of omalizumab (150mg
every 4 weeks) for long-term management of
refractory CSU following initial therapy [20],
and high dosages (450 or 600 mg every 4 weeks)
for partial or non-responders [12, 21, 22].
Moreover, some authors suggest that long-term
omalizumab treatment may not alter the natural history of the disease and could increase the
chance of spontaneous remission [22, 23].

The omalizumab clinical trials were all
designed with a standard interval of treatment
of 4 weeks, irrespective of serum immunoglobulin E level or body weight [5-7]. Some studies
have experimented with personalized dosage
intervals, concluding that some patients may
tolerate dosage intervals longer than 4 weeks,
while others may require reduced dose intervals
in order to avoid relapse of the disease
[20, 21, 23, 24]. We suggest that future patient
therapies should consider both individualized
dosages and optimal intervals.

Evidence suggests that following successful
omalizumab treatment, eventual relapse can be
again successfully treated with omalizumab
[24]. In one study, all patients reported a rapid
and complete response within the first 4 weeks
of retreatment with omalizumab, and often
even during the first week, without relevant
adverse events [24]. Our study confirmed the
data of literature showing a complete response,
without adverse effects, in the three patients
with relapse. Moreover, a good response was
obtained in all these patients within the first
week of retreatment.

Interestingly, in all responding patients in
the current study, until they achieved a complete response, we observed a slight enhancement of daily UAS a few days prior to the next
administration of omalizumab. This phenomenon may be due to the biological half-life
of omalizumab, which is about 26 days, or may
be due to a psychological effort of upcoming
treatment.

Currently, there is only limited evidence for
the long-term use of omalizumab for CSU, as
completed clinical trials only provide data up to
6 months [5-7]. Some ongoing trials are investigating treatment for up to 1 year (XTENDCIU; NCT02392624) and retreatment effectiveness (OPTIMA; NCT02161562) [12]. In our

299

study, at a relatively long follow-up, only one
major adverse event (thrombocytopenia) was
reported, confirming the safety profile into the
long term of omalizumab for CSU patients.

It still remains unknown for how long omalizumab may be administered continuously and
if longer treatment duration or retreatment will
induce earlier remission. Moreover, it is not
known whether an immediate effective treatment will contribute to quick, complete, and
permanent disease control.

The limitations of our retrospective study
include the small number of enrolled patients
and the absence of history of angioedema
among this selected population.

CONCLUSIONS

Add-on omalizumab therapy for homogeneous
refractory CSU in a real-life setting following a
strict protocol of a single dosage of 300 mg
every 4 weeks seems to be effective and safe. We
propose that further research should investigate
personalized omalizumab treatment dosages
and administration intervals, based on UAS7
results, and the identification of biomarkers
able to predict changes in disease activity in
response to therapy for the development of
treatment algorithms for use in clinical practice.
