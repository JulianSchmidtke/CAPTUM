Serum-induced basophil CD63 expression by means of a tricolour
flow cytometric method for the in vitro diagnosis of chronic

urticaria

Background: Functional autoantibodies against the o-chain of the high-affinity
IgE receptor (FceRI«) identify a subset of patients with chronic urticaria (CU)
due to autoreactivity, as assessed by an in vivo positive response to autologous
serum skin test (ASST). We performed a study to standardize the serum-induced
basophil activation assay by flow cytometry (FCM) using a new tricolour
method, assessing the diagnostic performance of this test in discriminating beween ASST + and ASST- CU patients.

Methods: Sera of 64 CU patients (22 ASST+ CU and 42 ASST- CU) and 10
healthy subjects were tested for their ability to induce basophil CD63 expression
when incubated with whole blood of both atopic (Da) and non-atopic donors
(Dna). Using a triple-labelled strategy with anti-CD123, anti- HLA-DR and
anti-CD63 antibodies, CD63+ basophils were identified on a selected populaion of CD123+ HLA-DR- cells. In 3 ASST+ CU patients who underwent
cyclosporine therapy, the assay was performed before and after treatment.
Results: The ASST+ CU sera resulted in a significant higher induction of
basophil CD63 expression compared with ASST- CU and healthy donors sera;
when whole blood from Da, was used, sensitivity and specificity of the assay were
95.5% and 90.5% respectively. ASST + CU serum activity was significantly
decreased during cyclosporine A treatment, in parallel with clinical remission.
Conclusions: Chronic urticaria serum-induced CD63 expression assay performed
on Da whole blood by means of our tricolour FCM method could be the most
useful tool for identification of a subset of patients with autoimmune CU and
may become a promising tool also for monitoring treatment efficacy.

Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), defined as the occurrence of daily pruritic wheals for at least 6 weeks, is a
common skin disorder in which pathophysiological
mechanism often remains unknown, despite extensive
laboratory investigations (1, 2). A subset of patients with
Chronic urticaria (CU) may have an autoimmune basis
for their condition, suggested by a positive skin test
response to intradermal injection of autologous serum
[autologous serum skin test (ASST)] (3, 4). It is now well
accepted that up to half of patients with CIU (35-55%)
have functional circulating IgG autoantibodies directed
against the o-chain of the high-affinity IgE receptor
(FceRIa) or, less commonly, against IgE itself, which are
able to induce in vitro histamine release from basophils
and mast cells via a direct cross-linking of adjacent IgE or
IgE receptors (5-7). Although several attempts have been
made to develop specific and sensitive in vitro tests for the
detection of anti-FcsRIa autoantibodies in sera of

patients with autoimmune chronic urticaria (AICU), no
routine laboratory test is yet available for in vitro
diagnosis of AICU and time-consuming functional assays
(histamine release from healthy donor basophils and mast
cells) are required (8-11). As regard, basophil activation
can induce the release of several soluble mediators
(histamine, leucotrienes, cytokines and chemokines) as
well as the expression of membrane bound activation
markers (12, 13). CD63, a surface molecule (glycoprotein53) member of the tetraspan family, is the only marker
expressed de novo with a high density on activated
basophils (14) and its up-regulation have been shown to
well correlate with histamine release from basophils after
stimulation with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), anti-IgE antibody or allergens (15-17). Thus,
CD63 expression has been proposed as a reliable tool to
monitor basophil activation and several literature data
account for the application of flow cytometric analysis of

1071
Frezzolini et al.

in vitro activated basophils assessed by CD63 in allergy
diagnosis (16, 17). Recently, two independent studies
performed by Wedi et al. (18) and Gyimesi et al. (19)
investigated a flow cytometric basophil activation test for
the detection of AICU. The authors, using different
methods of basophil isolation and activation, demonstrated that sera from patients with CU and positive ASST
are able to induce in vitro CD63 expression on atopic
donor basophils identified by flow cytometry (FCM)
using monoclonal antibody (MoAb) directed against IgE.

In order to confirm the relationship between the in vivo
response to ASST and in vitro serum-induced basophil
CD63 expression we performed a study in a large series of
CU patients using a novel tricolour flow cytometric
method based on CD63, CD123 and HLA-DR expression. It is well documented that, by means of FCM,
peripheral blood basophils can be selectively identified as
a distinctive single cell population using MoAbs directed
against the alpha chain of interleukin-3 receptor (antiIL-3Roa/CD123), staining predominantly basophils and
monocyte-derived dendritic cells (20), and the HLA-DR
antigen which is virtually absent on basophils (21-23).
Thus this method allows to accurately quantify CD63 +
activated cells on a selected population of CD123+
HLA-DR- basophils from whole blood. Furthermore we
statistically established a cut-off able to discriminate
ASST+ CU from ASST- CU patients giving the best
values of sensitivity and specificity by means of a
receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Three
patients with severe unremitting CU and a positive ASST
underwent cyclosporine A (CyA) treatment and modulation of serum-induced CD63 expression was evaluated in
response to therapy.

 

Patients and methods
Patients, sera and donors

We enrolled for the study 64 patients (46 females and 18 males
ageing from 32 to 54 years) with diagnosis of CU defined as
recurrent whealing occurring at least twice a week for more than
6 weeks. Physically or drug-induced urticaria, urticaria vasculitis
and allergic (IgE-mediated) urticaria were considered as criteria for
exclusion. When assumed, antihistamine treatment was stopped at
least 1 week before the study and none of the patients was taking
any other drug when serum samples were collected for ASST and
CD63 expression assay.

The severity of urticaria was estimated according to the body
surface area (BSA) affected by wheals at the assessment time and
scored as follows: 0 = no wheals; 1 = <20% BSA; 2 = from 20%
to 50% BSA; 3 = >50% BSA. The severity of itching was graded
from 0 to 3, where 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe.
The wheal and itch scores were added together, so that the maximum urticaria activity score was 6 (Tables | and 2).

Sera from 10 non-atopic healthy subjects served as control samples.
All sera, stored at —20°C until investigations, were thawed to room
temperature (RT) and heat inactivated (30 min at 56°C) before their
use to eliminate IgE and inactive complement. For in vitro seruminduced basophil activation test one non-atopic healthy donor (Dna;

when heparinized whole blood was collected.

Autologous serum skin test

Upon informed consent each subject enrolled in the study underwent
an intradermal test with 0.05 ml of fresh autologous serum performed
as described by Sabroe et al.; autologous serum, sterile saline solution
(0.9% W/v NaCl) as negative control and histamine (1 mg/ml) as
positive control were injected into the volar forearm healthy skin and
the ASST reactions were scored as positive when a red serum-induced
wheal with a diameter of > 1.5 mm than the saline-induced response
at 30 min could be observed. Twenty-two of 64 CU patients (34.3%)

were strongly positive on ASST (ASST + CU) and 42 of 64 (65.6%)
were negative (ASST- CU). ASST performed on the healthy control
group (n = 10) was negative in all subjects.

Flow-cytometric basophil CD63 serum-induced activation assay

Flow-cytometric quantitative expression of CD63 on activated basophils was measured on Dya and Dag cells. Briefly, 100 ul of
heparinized whole blood was directly incubated at 37°C on water
bath for 30 min with 100 wl of heat-inactivated undiluted sera of
CU patients and controls, making a final volume of 200 ul. Degranulation was stopped by adding 10 ul of 20 mM EDTA at RT
for 5 min and cells where then stained with 20 pl of CD63-FITC/
CD123-PE/Anti-HLA-DR-PerCP antibody cocktail (BD FastImmune™ CD63/CD123/Anti-HLA-DR; Becton-Dickinson, San
Jose, CA) and incubated for 15 min at RT. Finally, whole blood
probes were lysed (Ix BD FACS lysing solution; Becton-Dickinson), washed and resuspended in 300 l of 0.5% paraformaldehyde
to be measured on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson
Immunocytometry System, San Jose, CA) within 2 h. Setting a
threshold on FL2 (red fluorescence) to eliminate most of CD123
negative cells, at least 500 CD123+ cells per probe were acquired
and basophils were then identified as low side scatter (SSC),
CD123+ and HLA-DR- cells with a double gating strategy. CD63
basophil surface expression measured on FLI (green fluorescence)
was quantified on the gated CD123 + HLA-DR- cells (Fig. 1). The
addition of wash buffer alone and fMLP (1 pmol/l) to distinct tubes
served to establish respectively baseline values and positive control
of CD63 expression on donors’ basophils in three consecutive
experiments (MV + SD of CD63+ cells at baseline was
7.3% + 1.2% for Dna and 6.4 + 0.2 for Da; MV + SD of
CD63 + cells after fMLP stimulation was 23% + 3% for Dna and
45% + 2.2 for Da, P < 0.001).

Three of 22 ASST+ CU patients with severe relapsing disease,
unresponsive to antihistamines, were selected for short-term CyA
treatment (Sandimmun Neoral® at 3 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, 2 mg/
kg/day for the next 2 weeks and | mg/kg/day for the remaining
2 weeks). Serum samples from these patients were collected to
perform ASST and serum-induced CD63 activation assay before,
after 4 weeks and at the end of the therapy (8 weeks).

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed by a software package (SigmaStat
2.03 for Windows; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) and Student’s
t-test or Mann-Whitney rank sum test were alternatively used to
determine significant differences between groups, depending on the
type of distribution. In ASST+ CU patients treated with CyA, a
Paired #-test served to establish the modulation of serum induced
CD63 expression during treatment. A ROC curve analysis was used
to estimate the cut-off of CD63 serum-induced assay able to discriminate ASST + CU from ASST- CU patients, regarding optimal
values of sensitivity and specificity. The area under the ROC curves
(AUC) was calculated by Analyse-it 1.69 program (Analyse-it
software, Ltd, Leeds, UK) to evaluate the discriminatory value of
the test. Unless otherwise stated, all data are shown as mean values + standard deviation (MV + SD) and a probability (P) value
of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

Results
CD63 surface expression on donor basophils in response to sera

As shown in Fig. 2, when heat-inactivated, undiluted
ASST+ CU sera (1 = 22) were used to stimulate donors
whole blood, a significant induction of CD63 on basophils from both Da and Dna with respect to ASST-— CU
(n = 42) and normal sera (n = 10) was documented by
FCM (P < 0.001). However, ASST+ CU sera activity
was about 1.8-fold higher in Da than in Dna, being the
mean percentage of CD63+ basophils significantly higher in Da when compared with Dyna (33.3 + 14 vs
18.9 + 7; P < 0.001).

Diagnostic performance of the serum-induced CD63 expression
assay

A ROC curve was derived to establish the ability of the
serum-induced CD63 expression assay to discriminate
ASST+ CU and ASST- CU patients when whole blood
from Da was used. The AUC for the assay was 0.971,
that means an overall probability (97.1%) that ASST +
CU patients can be correctly identified by FCM measurement of CD63 expression (P < 0.0001). By analysing
the ROC curve, the cut-off value giving the best
sensitivity and specificity (95% and 91% respectively)
was found to be 15% (Fig. 3).

Modification of serum-induced CD63 expression during CyA
therapy

In three ASST+ CU patients treated with oral administration of CyA serum samples were collected before
(TO), after 4 weeks (T1) and at the end of therapy (T2)
and evaluated for CD63 induction on Da whole blood.
When compared with TO, a significant reduction of mean
percentage of CD63+ basophils was detected at T1
(57 + 8.5% vs 14.6 + 6.4; P = 0.02), further decreasing
at T2 below the calculated cut-off (9.3 + 2%; P < 0.01)
(Fig. 4). All treated patients showed an early clinical
response (2 weeks) in terms of itch and wheals reduction,
and a complete clearing of skin lesions was obtained at
4 weeks, still maintaining when CyA was tapered at lower
dosage for further 4 weeks. The ASST performed at T1
and at the end of CyA therapy (T2) was negative in all
patients.

and basophils has been largely documented (2, 5-7) and
the term of AICU now identifies a subset of patients in
which these autoantibodies are the cause of the lesions, as
suggested by a positive in vivo response to intradermal
injection of autologous serum (3, 4). Although numerous
attempts have been made to devise specific and sensitive
in vitro tests for AICU, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and other immunobinding assays (6, 7,
11), the current gold standard laboratory test is the
demonstration and measurement of histamine release
from target basophils or dermal mast cells (4, 9). It is well
known that basophils activation can be detected by flow
cytometric measurement of CD63, a tetraspan granule
protein that appears de novo on basophils membrane after
degranulation (14); in resting basophils, CD63 is anchored in basophilic intracytoplasmic granules and, as a
consequence of cell degranulation, it is expressed with a
high density on activated basophils and mirrors mediators
release (15-17). Two previous studies by Wedi et al. (18)
and Gyimesi et al. (19) based on different laboratory
approach demonstrated that sera of a subset of CU
patients with positive ASST are able to induce CD63
expression on atopic donors basophil when identified with
a two-colour flow cytometric method using anti-IgE and
anti-CD63 MoAbs. On the basis of these interesting data,
the goal of our study was to standardize the CU seruminduced CD63 expression assay on a large series of
patients by means of a new tricolour flow cytometric
method which allows to accurately quantify activated
CD63 + cells on a selected population of CD123+ HLADR- basophils from whole blood, without IL-3 pretreatment (22, 23). Applying this method for the first time in a
large series of CU patients, our results demonstrated that

(i) sera from ASST+ CU patients are able to induce
CD63 expression on donors basophil in a significant
higher manner when compared with ASST- CU patients
and healthy donors sera, (ii) ASST+ CU serum activity
on CD63 expression was significantly enhanced when
basophils from an atopic sensitized donor were used, (iii)
according to the ROC-generated cut-off value of 15%, the
sensitivity and specificity of the serum-induced CD63
expression assay was 95.5% and 90.5% respectively, (iv)
ASST+ CU serum induced CD63+ basophils from Da
are significantly decreased below the cut-off during CyA
treatment, in parallel with the complete clearing of skin
lesions and the reduced ASST response. Wedi et al. (18),
using whole blood primed with IL-3, demonstrated
serum-induced CD63 expression in 70% of ASST + CU
patients, as well as in 45% of ASST- CU and in 35% of
control subjects (both atopic and nonatopic), thus concluding that CU serum activity inducing CD63 expression
cannot be regarded as a diagnostic marker of CU.
Gyimesi et al. proposed a modified protocol of CU
serum-induced CD63 expression assay using dextransedimented washed leucocytes from highly sensitized
atopic donors, thus avoiding preliminary priming with
IL-3. With this method they reported higher values of
sensitivity and specificity in respect to Wedi et al.,
documenting CD63 expression in 91% of ASST+ CU
patients and in 17% of ASST- CU patients, with no
induction of CD63 in both healthy and disease control
groups (19). On one hand, our results confirm, in
agreement with Gyimesi et al., that ASST+ CU sera are
able to significantly induce CD63 expression on basophils,
in contrast to ASST-— CU and healthy donors sera. On the
other hand, using a model consisting of whole blood
without IL-3 pretreatment and a different strategy of
basophils identification, we statistically found values of
sensitivity and specificity of the serum-induced CD63
assay higher than those observed in the previous studies.
We believe that the improved diagnostic performance may
be due especially to the new tricolour flow cytometric
method used in our study which allows an high basophil
recovery even in whole blood. Indeed, the identification of
basophils using prior protocols relied on a single IgElabelling, although it is known that FceRI expression can
vary considerably on cell surfaces from one subject to
another (24). CD123, costitutively expressed at high
density on basophils, is known to be a useful marker for
basophil identification, as its expression is less variable
than surface IgE and is independent of the allergy status
of the donor (20, 23). With a double gating strategy of
basophil phenotyping which isolate low side scatter,
CD123+ HLA-DR- cells, the expression of CD63 can
be easily and accurately quantify in this selected population. The higher sensitivity of this method could also
explain the ASST+ CU serum activity in inducing CD63
expression also on Dna basophils, although the use of Da
whole blood is highly recommended to obtain a better
results in terms of the magnitude of the serum challenge.

Taking in mind the crucial need for inter-laboratory
standardization in clinical decision-making, we suggest
that the easy recognition of basophils in whole blood
and the reliable assessment of their activation by means
of this tricolour FCM protocol could be the most useful
tool for in vitro identification of a subset of patients with
CU of possible autoimmune origin in which a third line
therapy with immunomodulatory drugs could be contemplated (1, 2, 4). As regard, cyclosporine has been
successfully employed in randomized controlled trials
involving severe, unremitting AICU (25, 26) and its
effectiveness may be attributed to the ability to inhibit
basophil and mast cell degranulation as well as T-cell
dependent antibody formation by B cells (25, 27-29). In
our study we provide the first evidence that, in severe
ASST+ CU patients who underwent short-term CyA
treatment, serum-induced CD63 expression is signifi
cantly reduced during therapy, in accordance to clinical
remission and ASST response, suggesting that the assay
may also become a promising tool for monitoring the
effectiveness of immunomodulatory drugs in AICU.
Recently, the presence of a histamine-releasing factor
specific for mast cells and not active on basophils, other
than an anti-FceRI or anti-IgE autoantibody, has been
documented by Sabroe et al. (6) in a small subset of CU
patients with positive ASST (about 9%) and, in these
cases, a negative serum-induced basophil activation test
result should be expected. Furthermore, although many
functional and structural similarities between basophils
and mast cells exist, a FCM detection system using mast
cell lines and/or chimeric cell lines expressing the human
FceRI may be validated in the future for a larger
screening of CU sera with both basophil and mast cells
activating properties.
