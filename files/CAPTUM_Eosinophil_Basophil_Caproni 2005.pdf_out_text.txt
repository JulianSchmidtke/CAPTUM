Abstract

The term chronic autoimmune urticaria (CAIU) is used for chronic urticaria in subjects who present a whealing response to the
intradermal injection of autologous serum, suggesting the presence of pathogenic antibody activities.

In this study, we examined 28 chronic urticaria subjects with positive autologous serum skin test (ASST), all of whom presented
autologous serum-induced lesions at different evolutive stages. Punch biopsies were taken from lesional skin of six subjects at 10’, eight
subjects at 30’, six subjects at 60’, and four subjects each at 24 and 48 h. Immunological studies focussed on infiltrating cell
immunophenotype and related cytokines, chemokines and chemokine receptors, adhesion molecules. Immunohistochemical staining was
performed to measure expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, tryptase, eosinophil cationic protein, myeloperoxidase, basophil granular protein, IL-4,
IL-5, IL-8, CCR3 and CXCR3, ICAM-1, VCAM and ELAM. Control staining was done on unaffected skin from the patients and normal
skin from four healthy donors.

The main infiltrating population was represented by neutrophils, seen focally in both unaffected skin (P = 0.001) and healthy controls
(P = 0.003). IFN-y and IL-5 were expressed focally in autologous wheals. Significant staining for IL-4 was seen at 30’. CCR3 and
CXCR3 were expressed less in autologous wheals than in uninvolved skin (P < 0.0001; P = 0.002). Cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs)
reached their highest expression at 30’ and 60’ in induced lesions, and they showed strong expression also in unaffected skin (ICAM-1: P <
0.0001).

Our data show that the immunoinflammatory features of ASST-induced wheals involve a prevalent role of lymphocytes (with a mixed
Th1/Th2 response), with strong neutrophil infiltration and activity and involvement of the chemokine pathway. We interpreted the finding of
inflammatory cells and mediator up-regulation in uninvolved CIU skin as a sign of prolonged and widespread “urticarial status”.

Introduction Previous studies have clarified that chronic idiopathic

urticaria (CIU) includes a heterogeneous subset (up to 46%

Chronic urticaria (CU) is currently defined as the daily or
almost daily occurrence of wheals for at least 6 weeks, and
the term “idiopathic” urticaria (CIU) is used for CU cases in
which neither signs of vasculitis nor causative drugs, foods,
and/or physical factors can be individuated [1,2].

of cases) [2] that presents a previously unidentified serum
factor, later discovered to be an antibody that most probably
plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CIU. This
antibody belongs to the IgG isotype and it reacts against the
a-chain of the high affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) of
basophils and mast cells, or alternatively against IgE itself
[3]. Functional properties of antibodies are evidenced in
vivo by the intradermal injection of autologous serum
M. Caproni et al. / Clinical Immunology 114 (2005) 284-292 285

(autologous serum skin test, ASST) [4], that is able to
induce a wheal-and-flare response in patients with CIU;
further evidence is seen in vitro with the release of histamine
from basophils and mast cells elicited by addition of CIU
patient serum [5-7].

Since CIU has been hypothesized to have an autoimmune
pathogenesis, the term chronic autoimmune urticaria
(CAIU) has been proposed for CIU patients with positive
ASST and in vitro assays. These subjects frequently present
an increased incidence of autoimmune disorders (e.g.,
thyroiditis) and more severe urticarial clinical features than
normal CU patients [8].

The literature includes several reports that contribute to
better understanding the pathogenesis and effector mechanisms of CIU, focussed in turn on the different cellular
populations that infiltrate urticarial lesions. Comprehensive
review of the molecular immunopathology of CIU seems to
indicate early activation of mast cells [9-11], followed by a
lymphocyte and granulocyte cell-mediated hypersensitivity
reaction with a ThO (or, alternatively, a mixed Th1/Th2)
cytokine profile [12-19].

However, the real advances in this field came with
studies on the temporal evolution and changes of the wheal
infiltrating cells. In particular, Grattan et al. [20] in 1990
performed the first serial biopsies of autologous seruminduced wheals in CIU patients. Then, confirming mast cell
degranulation by electron microscopy in early wheals, he
demonstrated that, like T lymphocytes, perivascular neutrophils and eosinophils showed a tendency to increase from
30 min to 2 h. At 24 h, CD4+ T cells significantly outnumbered CD8+ cells; at 48 h, the neutrophils were clearing, but
the eosinophils and lymphocytes persisted.

Also Sabroe et al. [2] sought to determine the timing of
the inflammatory infiltrate in the wheals of CIU patients and
to detect differences between patients with and without
antibodies. These investigators found that eosinophil,
neutrophil, and lymphocyte infiltration was more extensive
in both “recent” and “established” wheals (less than 4 h and
more than 12 h, respectively) than in uninvolved skin of
CIU subjects with positive ASST. CIU subjects without
antibodies had greater numbers of eosinophils in established
wheals than those with antibodies, but the two groups
presented no other significant difference, suggesting that
eosinophil activation may occur later or be more persistent
in urticaria subjects without antibodies [2].

Similarly, in a previous study [21], we tried to find more
specific information on the function of the inflammatory
response in spontaneous wheals of CAIU subjects. We
found similar tryptase staining in both CAIU subjects and
healthy controls. Moreover, the lack of any significant
differences between lesional and unaffected skin of CAIU
subjects in the expression of T lymphocytes, adhesion
molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1), and chemokines (CChemokine Receptor 3, CCR3) seemed to indicate widespread immunological activation, involving not only
lesional tissues, but possibly the entire skin immune system

[21]. These findings recapitulate Natbony’s previously published conclusions [22].

In the present study, we examined autologous seruminduced lesions at different evolutive stages to find further
information about the pathological mechanisms of CAIU.
We carried out thorough investigations of immunophenotype of infiltrating cells, related cytokines, chemokines and
chemokine receptors, and adhesion molecules.

Methods
Patients

The study comprised twenty eight patients (15 M, 13 F;
age range 23-68; median age 42,08 years) diagnosed with
chronic urticaria. All subjects had a disease duration of more
than 3 months, with recurrent whealing at least twice a
week. All the subjects presented a positive autologous
serum skin test (ASST), as defined by Grattan et al. [23] and
positive in vitro serum-evoked histamine release assays
(HRA). HRA was performed on basophils of healthy donors
as previously described [24]. Antihistamines were discontinued 1 week before skin testing in all cases and none of the
subjects was taking other drugs. The exclusion criteria were
negative response to ASST, predominant physical urticaria,
allergic urticaria (IgE-mediated), urticaria-vasculitis, C,esterase inhibitor deficiency, drug or alcohol abuse, pregnancy, and lactation. Four age- and sex-matched healthy
subjects were recruited as controls. Baseline investigations
included search for circulating immunocomplexes (CIC)
and organ and non-organ specific antibodies to evidence any
autoimmune stigmata in our patients.

Biopsies

Six of the 28 patients with CIU and positive ASST were
subjected to 4 mm punch biopsies taken from an autologous
serum-induced wheal 10 min after development, the established baseline time. Bioptic specimens were taken from
eight subjects at 30 min, from six at 60 min, and from four
each at 24 and 48 h. Additional biopsies were taken from
apparently uninvolved skin of four of the above subjects
before the ASST was performed (¢ = 0). Finally, four control
specimens were obtained from the healthy donors.

The biopsies were performed under local ring anesthesia
(without adrenaline) and covered in cryoprotectant (TissueTek, Miles INC, USA) before storage at —80°C.

Immunohistochemistry

Tissue specimens were cut into 5-um sections that were
then stained with hematoxylin—eosin for routine immunohistochemical examination.

The various types and titers of monoclonal antibodies
(Mo Abs) used included MoAbs against tryptase at 1:50
286 M. Caproni et al. / Clinical Immunology 114 (2005) 284-292

(Dako Ltd., High Wycombe, UK) to detect mast cells. For
the detection of human T lymphocytes, we used CD3 at
1:20 pan-specific for T cells, CD4 at 1:50 specific for Thelper cells, CD8 at 1:20 specific for cytotoxic/suppressor T
cells (Dako). Neutrophils stained with Mo Abs against
myeloperoxidase (MPO) at 1:100 (Dako). Eosinophils were
labeled with anti-EG1 at 1:150 and anti-EG2 at 1:300
(Pharmacia and Upjon Diagnostics Ab, Uppsala, Sweden)
that bind to the epitope of eosinophilic cation protein (ECP)
in the non-secreted and secreted forms. BB1 at 1:10, a novel
Mo Ab (the kind gift of Dr A.F. Walls, University of
Southampton, United Kingdom) was used to find human
basophil granular protein.

We studied the cytokines in tissue specimens using Mo
Abs anti-IL4 at 1:20, anti-IL-5 at 1:50, anti-IL8 at 1:100,
anti-IFN-y at 1:100 (R&D Systems, Europe Ltd. Abingdon,
UK). The Mo Abs for integrins used were ICAM-1 at 1:50
(Immunotech, Marseille, France), V-CAM at 1:50 (R&D
Systems), ELAM at 1:100 (Novocastra Laboratories Ltd.,
Newcastle upon Tyne, UK). We also studied two chemokine
receptors using antibodies against CCR3 at 1:50 and antiCXCR3 at 1:50 (R&D Systems).

Frozen sections were air-dried and fixed in acetone
(5 min) before staining. Immunolabeling was performed
using rabbit anti-mouse bridging antibodies conjugated with
alkaline phosphatase (1:10 dilution, 30 min) (Dako)
followed by incubation with murine alkaline phosphatase
anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) complexes (1:30 dilution, 30 min) (Dako). Two independent observers did
“blind” assessments of the histological sections. For
quantitative analysis, we used the mean of the stained cells
counted in three adjacent microscopic fields (250) of each
section.

Statistical analysis

Results were expressed as mean + standard deviation
(SD) of the mean. The first step consisted in comparing the
mean of stained cells in autologous wheal sections and then
calculating statistical differences between the mean numbers
observed at different times. Later, we compared results from
lesional, uninvolved and healthy skin. Statistical significance (P < 0.05) was assessed by Student’s f¢ test.

Results
Immunological profile

Circulating anti-thyroid autoantibodies were detected in
15 CIU subjects (7 had anti-thyreoglobulin and 10 antiperoxidase autoantibodies). Eight subjects had anti-nuclear
autoantibodies with a titer of 1:40. Two CIU subjects had
anti-gastric parietal cell antibodies, one anti-pancreatic
islet, none had CIC, and 7 had anti-Helicobacter pylori
antibodies.

Histologic examination

All biopsies from affected skin showed interstitial dermal
edema, dilated venules with endothelial swelling and a
perivascular and interstitial mixed-cell infiltrate in agreement with the original diagnosis of urticaria. We did not
observe any signs of vasculitis-like endothelial degeneration, vessel necrosis, leukocytoclasia, fibrin deposition or
erythrocyte extravasation.

Cellular infiltrate

In autologous wheals, lymphocytes (CD3+, CD4+,
CD8+) were located mainly in the perivascular upper- and
mid-dermis. No significant variations in mean numbers
were evidenced at different time checks (Table 1, Fig. 1).
The CD4/CD8 ratio was about 2:1 at all times.

CIU subjects with positive ASST showed more numerous CD4- and CD8-positive cells in apparently uninvolved
skin than in lesional skin. Induced lesions and unaffected
skin showed significant differences in CD4 cells up to 60’
and CD8 cells up to 24 h.

On the other hand, skin from healthy donors showed
lower T lymphocyte counts (Table 1). Statistical difference
was always significant for CD4, and only at 48 h for CD8.

In skin biopsies from autologous wheals, tryptasepositive (+) mast cells were detected in the upper- and
mid-dermis with a prevalent perivascular and periadnexal
pattern. The intensity of staining did not change remarkably
in autologous serum-induced wheals at subsequent times of
observation (Table 1). Mast cell mean counts were similar to
those of unaffected skin of the same patients and normal
control specimens (Table 1). Statistical analyses did not
evidence any significant differences within a group at different times or between uninvolved patient skin and healthy
controls.

In autologous wheals, MPO+ neutrophil granulocytes,
located in the upper perivascular dermis, increased progressively, representing at 60’ the major cellular population
infiltrating autologous wheals (Fig. 1). The mean of MPO+
cells at 60’ significantly outnumbered those at both 10’ and
48 h (Table 1). Neutrophil infiltration was significantly
lower in both unaffected CIU skin and specimens from
healthy controls than in autologous wheals (Table 1).

In lesional skin, eosinophils were located mainly in
perivascular dermal sites. Eosinophil functional activity was
studied by immunohistochemical markers EG1 and EG2
that detect the intra- and extracellular isoform of ECP,
respectively. We observed a progressive increase in EG1+
cells from 10! to 60’ followed by decreases at 24 and 48 h,
but this trend was not statistically significant (Table 1).
EG1+ cells were poorly represented in uninvolved skin of
urticaria subjects as well as in healthy donor specimens
(Table 1).

EG2 expression increased up to 48 h, but this increase
was significant only after 24 h. EG2 staining was weak in

samples of both uninvolved skin from CIU subjects and
healthy controls.

In autologous wheals, basophils were located predominantly in intra- and perivascular sites in the superficial
dermis and showed prevalently intracellular staining. A
statistically significant increase for BB1 was evident at 30’
(Fig. 1), followed by a trend to slow decrease. Interestingly,
we detected relevant amount of these cells also in unaffected
skin of CIU subjects, but they were poorly represented in
the skin of healthy controls.

Cytokines, chemokines, and chemokine receptors

In autologous wheals, IFN-y-positive cells showed
focal dermal staining with constant mean counts at
subsequent observations (Table 2). Staining in wheal
specimens at 24 h was significantly different from that
observed in uninvolved skin of urticaria subjects. Skin
specimens from healthy controls did not show any IFN-y
expression (Table 2).

IL-4 staining, possibly attributable to activated T
lymphocytes, mast cells, and basophils, increased in
lesional skin within the first 30’ (Fig. 2), when it showed
the highest expression, and then it started to decrease from
the peak. However, this trend was not statistically
significant (Table 2). Skin of healthy controls was negative
for IL-4 expression, whereas uninvolved skin specimens
from CIU subjects showed a low mean value that differed
significantly from that of the autologous wheal at 10’
(Table 2).

In autologous wheals, focal perivascular staining for IL-5
was detectable in the dermis from the time of 30’ (Fig. 2)
and it started decreasing in the first hour thereafter (Table 2).
In uninvolved skin, IL-5 was assessed at a mean value of
3.6 + 4.0, significantly different from the 60’ count in
lesional skin (Table 2). No reactivity for IL-5 protein was
found in skin of healthy controls.

IL-8, a monocyte-, neutrophil-, eosinophil-, and mast
cell-related chemokine, was moderately expressed in epidermis and dermis with constant intensity in autologous
wheals (Table 2). There was moderate IL-8 staining in
uninvolved skin of affected subjects, but none in the skin
sections of healthy controls. (Table 2).

Chemokine receptor expression of lesional skin at
different times (particularly CXCR3) was very similar to
that of healthy control skin, except at 30’ when CXCR3
showed a higher cell count in lesional skin. However, no
significant difference was found between the 10’ and 30!
values (Table 2), and when compared to uninvolved CIU
skin, the difference was significant only at 10’. Otherwise,
CCR3 staining was slighter than that in CXCR3 at the
different times, but without significant variation (Table 2).
Uninvolved skin showed a mean CCR3 expression of 14.1 +
6.6 significantly different from that of the autologous wheal
at 10’. No significant differences were observed between
lesional skin and that of healthy controls.

Cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs)

In autologous wheals, ELAM expression was slightly but
not significantly increased at 60/ (Table 2).

In uninvolved CIU skin ELAM expression was assessed
at a mean of 6.7 + 4.6, a value not significantly different
from that of autologous wheals.

The highest expression of ICAM-1 was reached at 30/
but overall there was no significant difference in expression
between autologous wheals and skin of healthy controls
(Table 2). VCAM showed the highest expression at 48 h
with statistically relevant increase compared to the 10’ value
(Table 2). These CAMs were intensely expressed in
uninvolved skin of urticaria subjects (Table 2).

Discussion

In this study, ASST-induced wheals of CIU subjects were
sequentially biopsied at different times after their appearance and specimens were subjected to investigation of
immunophenotype of infiltrating cells and related molecules. Our data describe evolutive stages of the wheal-andflare skin process and are compared to findings from both
uninvolved skin of the same urticaria subjects and skin
specimens from healthy donors. The aim of the study was to
glean information about the pathogenesis and effector
mechanisms of CIU, considered a model of dynamic
inflammation.

We note that ASST alone is not sufficient to define CIU
as an autoimmune disease. However, ASST has often been
chosen as an experimental model (2,20) because it has an
effect very similar to that of the physiological stimulus that
causes whealing in urticaria. Moreover, it is performed in
vivo and in the very serum-donor subjects affected with
CIU, which allows one to avoid the many biases involved in
in vitro procedures.

One must also consider that in the large population of skin
test-positive subjects, different subsets can be distinguished
on the basis of whealing persistence. In fact, in our series,
only a minority of CIU subjects had long-lasting lesions (up
to 24 and 48 h). We can suppose that several individual
factors influence the duration of “idiopathic” urticaria
wheals, for instance, the nature and functional properties of
the “serum factor’ contained in CIU sera (anti-FceRI
antibodies, anti-IgE antibodies, other histamine-releasing
activities with different molecular characteristics). Other
variables that may influence wheal duration are basophil
releasability that varies largely from one subject [25] to
another, and/or basophil concentration in lesional tissue.

We detected in our specimens early participation of T
lymphocytes, already present at 30’ and persisting until 48 h,
which emphasizes their role in inflammatory response. As
mentioned above, this finding reproduces that of Grattan,
who also found a progressive increase in numbers of T cells
after the first determination (30') up to 24 h. Since T cell
numbers were significantly higher in uninvolved than in
affected skin of CAIU subjects, one might suggest that a
“latent” skin inflammation [26] extends to the entire surface
of the skin and mucosae, lowering the reactive threshold to
triggering stimuli. This “urticarial status” [25—28] could also
explain the extreme spreading characteristic of CIU wheals.
The principal difference between our investigation and that
of Grattan regards the CD4/CD8 ratio, that was about 2:1 in
our series, whereas in Grattan’s study CD8 cells outnumbered CD4 cells at all times, except at 24 h.

In regard to mast cells, we did not observe significantly
different numbers of these cells in autologous wheals,
unaffected skin of the same subjects and healthy controls,
contrary to the findings of increases in mast cell in CIU
lesions reported in the literature [11,27]. Moreover, in our
specimens, mast cell counts were constant at different times
in autologous wheals, deduced from the lack of significant
fluctuations in tryptase staining from 30’ to 48 h. This
observation, however, is not incompatible with the predominant role of tryptase+ mast cells and related mediators in
hive formation, but merely suggests that we should consider
their activation to occur very early, as previously proposed
[11,12]. We might speculate that involvement of mast cells,
in particular their activation and degranulation, is predominant at the very onset of the induced lesion (when they
would prime the immediate phase of inflammation), and that
afterwards, they play a less important role as revealed by the
lack of substantial differences in their numbers at different
times.

MPO staining, performed to quantify neutrophils, closely
resembled the findings reported in the previous literature
[20]. Neutrophils represented the main component of the
cellular infiltrate, the most diffuse dermal neutrophilia
appearing at 60’, with lower detectable staining at the other
times. The hypothesis that neutrophil granulocytes might
play an important role in the development of wheals,
through the release of inflammatory mediators, is supported
by the very weak MPO expression observed in both
uninvolved skin of CIU subjects and healthy control skin.
These cells, recruited only in those sites where a lymphocytic activation is already started, might leave blood vessels
and accumulate exclusively in whealing skin.

The reasons for the high chemoattraction of neutrophils
in CIU lesional skin remain to be clarified, and may entail

simultaneous involvement of various mechanisms. Some of
these mechanisms involve IL-8 that is important in chemotaxis, as well as in inducing shape change and degranulation
of cells [28]. However, it seems unlikely that it is the only
chemotactic molecule, especially since we found a similar
expression of this chemokine also in unaffected CIU skin,
where neutrophils are significantly less numerous. Thus,
some other granulocyte chemoattractant and/or activating
system might be sustained by other cytokines, such as IL-4
(that acts by enhancing the respiratory burst and phagocytic
properties [29]), mast cell-derived TNF-a and GM-CSF
[30], complement fragment C5a [31], and by CXCR3.

An effector role in the development of wheals can also be
suggested for eosinophils, shown in lesional skin by EG1
staining; this was remarkably similar to the neutrophil trend
in both ASST-induced lesions and hive-spared skin.
Eosinophil chemotaxis to lesional sites would be followed
by secretion of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), confirmed
by the progressive increase of EG2.

We have also demonstrated, using the well-defined
phenotype marker BB1, that basophils are present, indeed,
in autologous wheal biopsies at all times. Since basophils
express their FceRI, it seems likely anti-FceRI autoantibodies can directly interact with these cells to activate them
in situ. Moreover, the persistent staining for BB1 at 48 h
might explain the prolongation of wheals characterizing the
“autoimmune” subset of CIU patients.

The cellular infiltration pattern has already been investigated by other authors, and the novelty of the present study
consists in the immunohistochemical detection of cytokines
and chemokines. To date, few studies [12,32,33] have been
carried out to define the cytokine profile of the sera and/or
tissues of CIU patients. The only available data consist in
the serum increase of TNF-a and IL-10 in CIU subjects
compared to healthy controls, despite similar IL-4 levels in
the two groups, suggesting that an IgE-dependent mechanism might not be primarily involved in the etiopathogenesis of CIU.

IL-4 plays a role in cutaneous mast cell degranulation
and regulates the synthesis of IgE [34], and IL-5 is reported
to exercise specific chemotactic activity on eosinophils and
can induce the full pathway of eosinophil differentiation
[35]. Moreover, as shown by Ying et al. [12], in addition to
the prominent role of IL-4 and IL-5, also IFN-y is detected
in skin biopsies from CIU subjects (although not in allergeninduced late-phase reactions). This finding suggests that
there is a balance between Thl and Th2 cytokines in
urticarial inflammation, with early involvement of Th2-like
molecules (possibly derived from T helper lymphocytes,
basophils and mast cells) and later participation of Thl
activity, demonstrated by the significant increase of IFN-y at
24h.

We investigated CXCR3 and CCR3 expression as
prototypes of a and B-chemokine families.

Activated Th lymphocytes are the cellular source of these
molecules that in turn exert a chemoattractant function on
M. Caproni et al. / Clinical Immunology 114 (2005) 284-292 291

the very leukocytes. Alpha-chemokines (CXC-) promote
neutrophil attraction towards tissues, whereas B-chemokines
(CC-) recall monocytes, lymphocytes, basophils, and
eosinophils with variable selectivity [36,37]. Both CXCR3
and CCR3 showed a peak at 30’ in autologous wheals,
followed by a progressive decrease, suggesting that in early
whealing such recruiting mechanisms might work to attract
neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. CXCR3 receptor is
involved in classical Thl responses, while CCR3 is
primarily (although not exclusively) associated with Th2
pattern. These findings further confirm the combined
lymphocyte response. Moreover, the overlapping trend of
IL-4 and CCR3 in autologous wheals would further support
the proposed pathogenic role of basophils.

In addition to chemokines, other key players in tissue
localization of leukocytes are represented by cellular
adhesion molecules (CAMs). CAMs are cell surface
proteins that are important as mediators of close cell-cell
and cell—matrix interaction. They possess unique specificity
that allows them to interact selectively with ligands that may
be other adhesion molecules or matrix proteins [35].

Cassano et al. [27] have recently detected increased
expression of ELAM and VCAM in unaffected skin of
CIU patients compared to that of healthy controls. This
finding indicates that non-lesional skin presents signs of
latent inflammation, in agreement with previous [21,38]
and present studies showing high levels of adhesion
molecules in the uninvolved skin of patients with chronic
urticaria.

However, in addition to CAMs, also T cells, eosinophils, basophils, and chemokine receptors were often
overexpressed in unaffected CIU skin compared to
controls and lesional skin specimens. The observed upregulation of inflammatory cells, soluble mediators and
adhesion molecules in uninvolved CIU skin could reinforce the hypothesis of minimal persistent inflammation in
the apparently unaffected tissues. We suppose that,
analogously to what has been demonstrated in pathologic
atopy-related conditions like asthma and atopic dermatitis
[39,40], in CIU, the repeated whealing episodes would
modify the cutaneous microenvironment and the communication signals between the skin and the immune system.
This, in turn, would lead to an inflammatory cell influx
towards the entire skin surface to support chronic cycles of
injury and inflammation.

To conclude, our data all indicate the importance of
neutrophil and basophil infiltration and activity in ASSTinduced wheals. However, the quantitatively limited eosinophilic infiltration suggests that these cells have less
influence on autologous wheal than spontaneous lesions
[21]. Despite CAM expression in uninvolved and possibly
lesional CIU skin, it seems worth remarking that ASSTinduced wheals do not present higher levels of ELAM than
unaffected CIU skin does: this finding seems to indicate the
possible existence in CAIU of other “serum factors” whose
main function is neutrophil recruitment.

Altogether, our data on ASST-induced lesions evidence a
specific kinetics of cellular infiltration, mostly sustained by
T helper lymphocytes and neutrophils, with a mixed Th1/
Th2 response. While there is no significant difference in the
numbers of mast cells found in autologous wheals and
healthy skin at any of the time points evaluated, we noticed
that increased numbers of basophils are present at baseline
(10’) in wheals compared to healthy skin, with additional
recruitment at 30’.

Finally, as reported previously [12], even uninvolved
skin of CIU subjects presents an apparently latent inflammatory state characterized by a lymphocytic and granulocytic cellular infiltrate.
