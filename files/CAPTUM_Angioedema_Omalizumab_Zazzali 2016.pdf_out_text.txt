Background: Angioedema, present in some patients with chronic idiopathic/spontaneous urticaria (CIU/
CSU), may have a negative effect on patient quality of life.
Objective: To describe patient-reported angioedema and its management in the pivotal omalizumab studies
(ASTERIA I, ASTERIA II, GLACIAL).
Methods: Enrolled patients with CIU/CSU remained symptomatic despite treatment with histamine; (H1)antihistamines at licensed doses (ASTERIA I, ASTERIA II) or Hj-antihistamines at up to 4 times the approved
dose plus H>-antihistamines and/or a leukotriene receptor antagonist (GLACIAL). All studies administered
omalizumab (75, 150, or 300 mg in ASTERIA I and ASTERIA II; 300 mg in GLACIAL) or placebo subcutaneously
every 4 weeks for at least 12 weeks. Urticaria Patient Daily Diary entries were completed by patients and
summarized.
Results: At baseline, angioedema prevalence was higher in GLACIAL (53.1%) than in ASTERIA I (47.5%) or
ASTERIA II (40.7%). The mean proportion of angioedema-free days during weeks 4 to 12 was greater for
patients treated with 300 mg of omalizumab than placebo in ASTERIA I (96.1% vs 88.2%, P <.001), ASTERIA II
(95.5% vs 89.2%, P < .001), and GLACIAL (91.0% vs 88.7%, P = .006). Most patient-reported angioedema was
managed by low-intensity interventions (doing nothing or taking medication).
Conclusion: Treatment with 300 mg of omalizumab was efficacious in reducing patient-reported angioedema. Low-intensity interventions were generally used to manage angioedema episodes.

Jersey) is a humanized anti-IgE monoclonal antibody that has been
approved in Europe as add-on therapy for the treatment of CSU in
adults and adolescents at least 12 years of age with inadequate
response to Hj-antihistamines and in the United States for the
treatment of CIU in adults and adolescents at least 12 years of
age who remain symptomatic despite H-antihistamine treatment.2'° The omalizumab phase 3 clinical trials included
patients with CIU/CSU who remained symptomatic despite Hiantihistamine treatment at licensed doses (ASTERIA I, ASTERIA II)
or Hj-antihistamine treatment at up to 4 times the approved dose
in combination with Hp-antihistamines and/or a leukotriene
receptor antagonist (LTRA; GLACIAL).''"'? In these populations,
treatment with omalizumab significantly improved CIU/CSU
symptoms. Updated treatment guidelines and practice parameters
now include a recommendation for omalizumab as add-on therapy
to second-generation H,-antihistamines for the treatment of CIU/
csu2"4

In all the omalizumab phase 3 studies in CIU/CSU, the presence
of angioedema and its management were reported by patients via
an electronic daily diary. This article describes patient-reported
angioedema and its management from baseline to week 12 in
ASTERIA | and II as well as GLACIAL. Data from ASTERIA I and
GLACIAL from weeks 12 to 24 also are reported.

Methods
Omalizumab Phase 3 Studies

A summary of key pivotal study details is given in Table 1.
ASTERIA I and ASTERIA II were phase 3, global, randomized,
multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials
designed to assess the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in patients
with CIU/CSU. In ASTERIA I, patients who remained symptomatic
despite treatment with H;-antihistamines at licensed doses were
randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive omalizumab (75, 150, or 300 mg) or
placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 24 weeks (6 doses) with
16 weeks of additional observational follow-up. In ASTERIA II,
patients who remained symptomatic despite treatment with Hiantihistamines at licensed doses were randomized 1:1:1:1 to
receive omalizumab (75, 150, or 300 mg) or placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 12 weeks (3 doses) followed by an additional 16 weeks of observation. The primary end point in both
studies was change in the weekly itch severity score from baseline
to week 12. Further study details can be found elsewhere.'*"?

GLACIAL also was a phase 3, global, randomized, multicenter,
double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that assessed the
safety and efficacy of omalizumab in patients with CIU/CSU. In
contrast to ASTERIA I and II, patients were included in GLACIAL
after combination therapy failed (H;-antihistamines at up to 4
times the recommended dose plus Hp-antihistamines and/or
LTRAs). Enrolled patients were randomized 3:1 to receive 300 mg of
omalizumab or placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 24 weeks
(6 doses) with 16 weeks of follow-up. The primary objective of this

 

Table 1
Key study design features of ASTERIA I, ASTERIA II, and GLACIAL

study was to evaluate the safety of 300 mg of omalizumab vs placebo. The key efficacy end point was change in the weekly itch
severity score from baseline to week 12. Further study details can
be found elsewhere.!!

All studies were conducted in compliance with the ethical
principles originating in or derived from the Declaration of Helsinki
and in compliance with all International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines and all local regulatory
requirements. This was a secondary analysis of clinical trials;
detailed institutional review board approval and informed consent
were not applicable.

Data Collection

In all 3 studies, patients were given an electronic handheld
device (eDiary) at day —14 and completed the components of the
Urticaria Patient Daily Diary (UPDD)!""® twice per day for the study
duration. The UPDD questions included itch severity, number of
hives, largest hive size, sleep interference, daily activities interference, diphenhydramine (rescue medication) use, angioedema episodes and management, and health care professional contact for
CIU/CSU. The clinical trials collected angioedema status 2 weeks
before randomization. Baseline angioedema status was defined as
reporting angioedema 7 days before the randomization date and
was obtained from patient-reported data in the eDiary (yes/no,
rapid swelling [angioedema] of the face, mouth, or elsewhere in the
last 24 hours). If they answered this question positively, they were
further questioned about what they did in response to angioedema:
(1) did nothing; (2) took medication; (3) called the health care
professional; (4) went to see the health care professional; or (5)
went to the emergency department (ED) at the hospital. Patients
were able to select all responses that applied.

Angioedema End Points

The proportion of angioedema-free days from weeks 4 to 12 of
therapy was a prespecified secondary end point for all 3 studies.
The proportion of angioedema-free days from weeks 4 to 12 was
calculated as a ratio. The numerator comprised the number
of days for which the patient indicated a no response to a UPDD
angioedema question described above. The denominator
comprised the total number of patient days with a nonmissing
diary entry, starting at the week 4 visit date and ending the day
before the week 12 visit date. Patients who withdrew before the
week 4 visit or who had missing responses for more than 40% of the
daily diary entries between the week 4 and 12 study visits were not
included in this analysis. No imputations were performed for
missing data. Exploratory analyses in these 3 phase 3 studies
included the proportion of patients reporting angioedema by study
week and, for those patients reporting angioedema during a
particular week, the number of days that angioedema was present
in that week and how the angioedema was managed. We present
data obtained during the full study period: active treatment (12

Statistical Analysis

The proportion of angioedema-free days from weeks 4 to 12 was
evaluated using a stratified Wilcoxon rank-sum test (van Elteren
test) with the presence of angioedema at baseline (yes/no) and
patient weight (<80 or >80 kg) as stratification variables in all 3
studies. Descriptive analysis of angioedema and angioedema management by study week from baseline to week 12 was performed on
the data from ASTERIA II; for ASTERIA I and GLACIAL, data from
baseline to week 24 were included. Data were summarized by
proportion of reports of angioedema by study week, the number of
days per week patients with angioedema reported angioedema,
angioedema-free days, and reports of angioedema management (all
prespecified in the statistical analysis plan for each study). The
number of angioedema days were analyzed using Poisson regression. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical
software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina).

Results

A total of 975 patients were randomized and received at least 1
dose of study drug in the 3 phase 3 studies: ASTERIA I (75 mg of
omalizumab [n = 77], 150 mg of omalizumab [n = 80], 300 mg
of omalizumab [n = 81], placebo [n = 80]), ASTERIA II (75 mg of
omalizumab [n = 82], 150 mg of omalizumab [n = 82], 300 mg
of omalizumab [n=79], placebo [n =79]), and GLACIAL (300 mg of
omalizumab [n = 252], placebo [n = 83]). Patients had similar
baseline characteristics and were more likely to be female (72.6%
[ASTERIA I], 75.8% [ASTERIA II], and 71.9% [GLACIAL]) than male;
most were white (82.7% [ASTERIA I], 84.5% [ASTERIA II], 89.0%
[GLACIAL]), and the mean age was 41.2 years (ASTERIA I), 42.5 years
(ASTERIA II), and 43.1 years (GLACIAL) (Table 2). At baseline, disease
activity, as assessed by the weekly Urticaria Activity Score during 7
days (composite of itch severity and number of hives), was high in

all 3 studies (Table 2). Angioedema prevalence rates at baseline
were 40.7% (ASTERIA II), 47.5% (ASTERIA I), and 53.1% (GLACIAL).
Use of previous CIU/CSU medications was higher in GLACIAL than in
ASTERIA I or II (Table 2).

Angioedema-Free Days on Weeks 4 to 12 (Prespecified Secondary
End Point)

A significantly greater mean proportion of angioedema-free days
from weeks 4 to 12 was observed with 300 mg of omalizumab vs
placebo in ASTERIA I (96.1% vs 88.2%, P <.001), ASTERIA II (95.5% vs
89.2%, P <.001), and GLACIAL (91.0% vs 88.1%, P < .001) (Fig 1).

Proportion of Patients Reporting Angioedema During Active
Treatment and Treatment Discontinuation

In all the phase 3 studies, for all treatment arms, the proportion
of patients reporting angioedema decreased from baseline to week
12 (Fig 2). The number of patients reporting angioedema was
lowest for 300 mg of omalizumab, evident after the first injection,
and sustained through week 12. In ASTERIA I (Fig 2A) and GLACIAL
(Fig 2C), fewer omalizumab-treated patients reported angioedema
than placebo-treated patients throughout the entire active treatment period (to week 24). Figure 2 suggests that patients treated
with 75 and 150 mg of omalizumab in ASTERIA I experienced an
increase in angioedema events a week before the next treatment
administration; however, further analyses revealed no clear trend
such nature in other arms in the reported studies (data not shown).
After treatment discontinuation (week 12, ASTERIA II; week 24,
ASTERIA I and GLACIAL), the number of patients reporting
angioedema increased in all treatment groups but did not return to
the rates reported at baseline (Fig 2).

Number of Days With Angioedema

In patients with angioedema, the number of patient-reported
days with angioedema remained constant or numerically
decreased during the initial 12-week study period; this effect was
observed in all study arms but was greatest for 300 mg of omalizumab (Fig 3). In ASTERIA I and II, a significant difference (P <.001)
for 300 mg of omalizumab vs placebo beginning in weeks 1 to 4 and
sustained through active treatment (weeks 21—24, ASTERIA I;
weeks 9—12, ASTERIA II) was observed. A statistically significant
difference was demonstrated in GLACIAL with the exception of
weeks 5 to 8 (P = .055). In all 3 studies, after the active treatment
periods were completed, there was a general trend of an increase in
days with angioedema.

Angioedema Management

Overall, when angioedema occurred, there was generally no
intervention or angioedema was managed by a low-intensity
intervention, such as taking medication (eg, antihistamine). Patients reported few instances of calling or visiting their health care
professional. There were no reports of visits to the ED or hospital
because of angioedema during the first 12-week study period in
ASTERIA I (Fig 4) or II (data not shown). During the first 12 weeks of
GLACIAL (Fig 5), patients reported 2 visits to the ED to manage
angioedema at weeks 1 (300 mg of omalizumab) and 7 (placebo
and 300 mg of omalizumab) and 1 visit to the ED to manage
angioedema at week 12 (300 mg of omalizumab). In addition, patients reported hospitalization for angioedema at weeks 3 and 6
(300 mg of omalizumab).

Similar to the initial 12-week period, management of
angioedema generally required no intervention or a low-intensity
intervention during weeks 13 to 24 of ASTERIA | and GLACIAL.
During weeks 13 to 24 of ASTERIA I, 2 patients reported ED visits for
angioedema: at weeks 21 (75 mg of omalizumab) and 24 (placebo).

Figure 5. Number of patients reporting interventions used to manage angioedema during weeks 0 to 24 in GLACIAL. Study drug was given at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks in
GLACIAL. In the GLACIAL trial, patients were randomized 3:1 to receive omalizumab or placebo. Graphs displaying angioedema management also follow the 3:1 ratio to allow
for comparison of the number of interventions across treatment arms. ED indicates emergency department; HCP, health care professional.

In GLACIAL, during weeks 13 to 24, there were no visits to the ED
and only 1 hospitalization (placebo).

Discussion

Angioedema was a prevalent symptom in patients with CIU/CSU
in the phase 3 studies of omalizumab and occurred in 44% to 53% of
patients at baseline. These rates are slightly higher than the 40% of
patients with CIU/CSU who have been reported to have angioedema.’ Approximately 40% to 50% of patients reported angioedema
at baseline. Disease activity at baseline was similar in all 3 studies.
However, previous CIU/CSU medication use was higher in patients
in GLACIAL, as expected based on the enrollment criteria, than that
in ASTERIA I or Il. During the active treatment period, use of 300 mg
of omalizumab resulted in a reduction in the percentage of patients
with angioedema and a reduction in overall angioedema days.
Results from ASTERIA I and GLACIAL provide evidence that reductions in the occurrence of angioedema with 300 mg of omalizumab were sustained with continued treatment to week 24.

Although phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trials remain the gold standard for establishing efficacy, the results

of this study should be interpreted in light of its limitations.
Angioedema and angioedema management were patient reported
rather than physician assessed, and severity was not assessed. The
etiology of self-reported angioedema was not investigated, and it is
possible that the angioedema was not related to CIU/CSU. However,
patients with diseases who may have symptoms of urticaria or
angioedema, such as urticarial vasculitis, urticaria pigmentosa,
erythema multiforme, mastocytosis, hereditary or acquired
angioedema, lymphoma, leukemia, or generalized cancer, were
excluded.''"'? We did not control for rescue medication use
because the omalizumab and placebo arms had the same baseline
and background treatment allowed. However, even with the same
allowed background therapy, patients receiving placebo might have
used more rescue medications than their counterparts in the active
treatment arms. Had this happened, this fact would have contributed to narrowing the gap between the active treatment and placebo arms. Patients tended to choose low-intensity (ie, did nothing
or took medication, such as an antihistamine) interventions to
manage their angioedema. These experienced patients (median
duration of CIU/CSU, 3—4 years) may have knowledge about
angioedema that nonexperienced patients may not possess, and
8 JL. Zazzali et al. / Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol xxx (2016) 1-8

the intensity of intervention in a nonexperienced population might
differ from what was observed in these 3 trials. In addition, patients
with CIU/CSU and angioedema but without hives were not included
in these trials. Further evaluation of this subpopulation of patients
with CIU/CSU is needed to determine whether their responses
parallel what was observed in these phase 3 trials. These trials
should include recently developed angioedema-specific tools for
measuring disease activity and effect.'”'®

Treatment with 300 mg of omalizumab was efficacious in
reducing patient-reported angioedema in patients with CIU/CSU
who were symptomatic despite a variety of treatments. Most
patients reported that they did nothing or took H,-antihistamine
medication to manage their angioedema. There were only a few
reports of high-intensity interventions (ie, calling a health care
professional or going to the ED or hospital) for angioedema
management. In summary, treatment with 300 mg of omalizumab
can help patients with CIU/CSU with angioedema in whom Hjantihistamine treatment is failing by reducing the number of days
with angioedema they experience.
