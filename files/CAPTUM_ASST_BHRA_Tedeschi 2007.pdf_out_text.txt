Summary

Interleukin (IL)-18 is a pleiotropic cytokine, which may play a role in autoimmune and
allergic disorders. Serum IL-18 levels were measured in 34 patients with chronic
ordinary urticaria (COU) and 17 normal subjects. In vivo and in vitro assays for
histamine-releasing factors, an autologous serum skin test (ASST) and a basophil
histamine release assay were also performed for all patients with COU. Serum IL-18
concentration was not significantly different between patients with COU and normal
subjects (mean + standard error of the mean 246.47 + 18.40 pg/mL vs. 213.88 +
22.24 pg/mL), and no significant difference was found between ASST-positive and
ASST-negative patients. However, in ASST-positive patients, IL-18 levels paralleled
clinical severity scores and showed a tendency to correlate with in vitro histamine
release. The increased IL-18 levels in the ASST-positive patients with most active
chronic urticaria may reflect stronger immune system activation and possibly an
involvement of IL-18 as a direct histamine-releasing factor.

 

Interleukin (IL)-18 is a pleiotropic cytokine produced by
monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, keratinocytes,
Langerhans’ cells and B cells, which can activate T cells
and induce either T-helper (Th)1 or Th2 responses,
depending on the cytokine environment.! It has been
suggested that IL-18 may play an important role either
in autoimmune disorders, characterized by a predominant Th1 response, or in allergic diseases, characterized
by a Th2 response.” In recent years, chronic ordinary
urticaria (COU), formerly considered an idiopathic
disorder, has been shown to be often an autoimmune
disease due to histamine-releasing autoantibodies directed against the « subunit of the high-affinity IgE
receptor or against IgE.’ The autologous serum skin
test (ASST) is an in vivo screening test for histamine

releasing autoantibodies and other vasoactive factors,
and allows discrimination between chronic autoimmune and chronic idiopathic urticaria.+> However,
the pathomechanism of COU is complex, and T lymphocyte-mediated mast-cell activation has also been
suggested, because a perivascular infiltration of T
lymphocytes, which are predominantly CD4-positive,
together with monocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils,
has been found at sites of urticarial lesions.° The
possible involvement of IL-18 in COU has not yet been
explored. In the present study, we measured serum IL18 levels in patients with COU and evaluated the
possible association of this cytokine with circulating
histamine-releasing factors and clinical severity.

Report

In total, 24 adult patients (6 men, 28 women; mean +
SEM age 45.9 + 2.6 years), diagnosed with COU at the
allergy centres of the Hospital Maggiore Policlinico and
the San Carlo Clinic (both Milan, Italy) during the first
quarter of 2005 were selected for the study. COU was

diagnosed on the basis of the recurrence of hives with or
without angio-oedema for >6 weeks. In all cases,
known causes of chronic or recurrent urticaria were
ruled out by appropriate investigations. Patients with
physical urticaria were also excluded. Two patients had
autoimmune thyroiditis; no other autoimmune or
chronic inflammatory disorders were reported. All
patients had active urticaria at the time of the study
and were being treated with H1 antihistamines. These
drugs (cetirizine, levocetirizine, loratadine, desloratadine
or fexofenadine in all cases) were stopped 5 days before
serum samples for in vivo (ASST) and in vitro [basophil
histamine release (BHR) and IL-18] assays were taken.
Disease activity was graded from 1 to 4 (slight,
moderate, severe and very severe) according to the
number of weals present at the time when blood
samples were collected, as previously described by
Sabroe et al.” Sera from 17 gender-matched and agematched healthy subjects (3 men, 14 women; mean +
SEM age 43.9 + 3.3 years) formed the control group.
All subjects participating in the study gave their
informed consent.

ASST was performed by intradermal injection of
0.05 mL of fresh autologous serum and read at 30 min,
following the method by Sabroe et al.* Intradermal
injection of saline solution (0.9% w/v NaCl) was used as
negative control and skin-prick test with 1 mg/mL
histamine as positive control. Patients showing a weal
with a diameter at least 1.5 mm greater than that
produced by the control saline solution were considered
positive. BHR was performed using leucocyte suspensions obtained from three normal blood donors, showing a 30% net release on challenge with an optimum
dose (10 pg/mL) of goat polyclonal antihuman IgE
(Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA), as described
previously.® Histamine concentration was measured by
an automated fluorometric method, and a 5% net
release cut-off value was used. One assay per serum was
performed to detect histamine-releasing activity. Serum
IL-18 concentration was measured by a sandwich
enzyme immunoassay with a sensitivity of 12.5 pg/mL
(MBL Medical & Biological Laboratories, Nagoya,
Japan).

Results were expressed as mean +SEM. Mann—
Whitney U-test, Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test, Fisher's exact test and Spearman’s rank correlation test were used for statistical
analysis. P-values < 0.05 were considered significant.

Mean + SEM IL-18 concentration was 246.67 +
18.40 pg/mL in COU patients and 213.88 + 22.24
pg/mL in normal subjects (NS; Table 1). In total,
17 patients were positive on ASST (50%) and 17

patients were negative. IL-18 concentration was not
significantly different between ASST-positive and
ASST-negative patients (241.29 + 27.95 pg/mL vs.
251.65 + 24.73 pg/mL, respectively; NS). Two ASSTnegative patients had associated autoimmune thyroiditis, and their IL-18 concentrations were 310 and
220 pg/mL, respectively. BHR was positive in 9 of 17
ASST-positive patients and in 2 of 17 ASST-negative
patients (52.9% vs. 11.1%, P = 0.02) with a mean +
SEM percentage release of 14.24+2.4% and
6.1% + 0.4%, respectively. A trend towards a positive
correlation was found between percentage histamine
release and serum IL-18 concentration in ASST-positive
patients with a positive BHR assay (r = 0.37, NS).
When patients with COU were grouped according to
ASST and BHR results, no difference in serum IL-18
concentration was observed between patients who
tested positive or negative on ASST or BHR (Table 2).
However, when patients were classified according to
disease severity, those with severe disease showed the
highest IL-18 levels. This was very clear in ASSTpositive patients (Fig. 1a), whereas it was not evident in
ASST-negative patients (Fig. 1b).

In conclusion, serum IL-18 concentrations did not
differ significantly between patients with COU and
normal subjects, nor did they differ in patients with
COU according to ASST and BHR assay results. Nevertheless, interestingly, IL-18 levels paralleled disease
severity in the ASST-positive group and showed a
tendency to correlate with in vitro BHR. This suggests
that in ASST-positive patients there may be some role
for IL-18 as a direct histamine-releasing factor, in

agreement with previous observations on its capacity to
stimulate IL-4 production and histamine release by
basophils.’ In contrast, the possible role of IL-18 as a
direct releasing factor is not evident in ASST-negative
patients, suggesting that different disease pathomechanisms may operate in the two patient groups. An
autoantibody-mediated mast cell activation has been
demonstrated in most ASST-positive patients; in the
remaining patients, mast-cell activation might be due to
other mechanisms, perhaps involving T-lymphocytes or
coagulation factors such as thrombin, which might act
as amplifiers/inducers of inflammation.!°
