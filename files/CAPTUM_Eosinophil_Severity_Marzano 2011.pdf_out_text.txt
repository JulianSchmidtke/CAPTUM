Introduction

Summary

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a skin disease caused by autoantibodies to
hemidesmosomal proteins BP180 and BP230, with eosinophils participating
in blister formation. Tissue factor (TF), the initiator of coagulation, is embodied within the eosinophil granules and exposed upon activation. We evaluated
the coagulation activation in patients with BP (63), chronic urticaria (CU; 20),
atopic dermatitis (AD; 14), cutaneous drug reactions (CDRs; six), psoriasis
(20), dermatitis herpetiformis (DH; four) and primary cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL; five), and in 40 healthy controls. Prothrombin fragment F1+2
and p-dimer (coagulation markers) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in all plasma samples and BP blister fluid. Skin TF
expression was evaluated immunohistochemically in the patients and 20
controls. F1+2 and p-dimer levels were higher in BP plasma than in control
plasma (P=0-0001 for both), and dramatically high in blister fluid; both
correlated positively with disease severity, esinophil counts and anti-BP180
antibodies (P = 0-006-0-0001). Plasma F1+2 and p-dimer levels were higher in
the CU, AD and CDR patients than in controls (P = 0-0001 for all), but normal
in the psoriasis, DH and CTCL patients. Skin TF was expressed in the BP
(P =0-0001), CU (P=0-0001), AD (P=0-001) and CDR patients (P= 0-01),
but not in the psoriasis, DH or CTCL patients. Co-localization confocal
microscopy studies confirmed eosinophils as the source of TF in 10 BP
patients. The coagulation cascade is activated in BP and other eosinophilmediated skin disorders, but not in non-eosinophil driven conditions. This
hypercoagulability may contribute to inflammation, tissue damage and, possibly, thrombotic risk.

It has been shown recently that eosinophil granulocytes are
an important source of tissue factor (TF), the initiator of
blood coagulation, in human blood [1]. TF is incorporated
into the specific granules of eosinophils and transferred
rapidly to their cell membranes during activation, thus facilitating transendothelial eosinophil migration [1]. The consequent activation of the coagulation system may have
implications locally (at the site of eosinophil infiltration)
and systemically (in the blood stream) [2].

In patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP), the prototype
of an autoimmune blistering disease due to autoantibodies
directed against two hemidesmosomal antigens (BP180 and

increased in peripheral blood [3-5]. Our preliminary data
showed that the coagulation cascade is activated in BP and
correlates with the severity of the disease and eosinophilia,
thus indicating that eosinophils play a role in coagulation
activation via TK, and contribute to local inflammation,
blister formation and, possibly, thrombotic risk [2,6]. It has
been reported that the risk of thrombosis is increased in
patients with BP [7,8] and in those with a number of other
eosinophil-mediated disorders [9,10].

The aim of this study was to evaluate the plasma
markers of coagulation activation by means of immunoenzymatic methods, and TF expression by means of

eosinophil-mediated or non-eosinophil-mediated inflammatory skin diseases. We also assessed the co-localization of
TF and CD125 (a classic eosinophil marker) in the BP
patients using immunofluorescence and laser scanning confocal microscopy.

Patients and methods

Patients

Bullous pemphigoid. Sixty-three patients with active BP (28
men and 35 women; mean age 75 years, range 43-99) diagnosed on the basis of classical clinical and immunopathological criteria [2] were studied. All patients had generalized
BP without any mucous membrane involvement (mean
disease duration: 1 month, range 0-2 months); the skin
lesions (vesiculobullous and/or erythematous—oedematous
lesions) covered a median of 40% of the total body area
(range 20-60%). Sixteen patients were studied after 2-8
months of systemic immunosuppressive treatment (methylprednisolone 40-80 mg/day at progressively tapering doses),
which led to complete clinical remission (defined as the
absence of any new BP lesions with complete healing of the
previous lesions for a minimum of 4 weeks) or partial remission, defined as incomplete healing of all the previous
lesions. At the time of the re-evaluation sampling, the
patients were receiving low-dose corticosteroids.

 

Chronic urticaria (CU). Twenty patients with severe CU (13
women and seven men; mean age 39 years, range 18-70)
were diagnosed on the basis of the appearance of continuous
or recurrent hives with or without angioedema for more
than 6 weeks. At the time of sampling, the patients had not
received systemic corticosteroids or anti-histamines for at
least 1 week.

Atopic dermatitis (AD). Fourteen adult patients (10 men
and four women; mean age 42 years, range 22-58) with AD
with an erythrodermic presentation were diagnosed on the
basis of typical clinical and histopathological features. At the
time of evaluation, the patients had not received any systemic treatment for at least 1 month.

Cutaneous drug reactions (CDRs). Six patients (two men and
four women; mean age 62 years, range 20-88) with histologically proven CDRs characterized by a widespread, symmetrically distributed maculopapular rash were studied. The
triggering drugs were non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (two cases), cephalosporins (two cases) and anticonvulsants (two cases). All patients were evaluated before
starting any specific treatment.

Psoriasis vulgaris. Twenty patients with severe psoriasis vulgaris (15 men and five women; mean age 47 years, range

19-73 years) were diagnosed on the basis of typical clinical
and histopathological characteristics; their psoriasis area and
severity index (PASI) scores ranged from 30 to 40. At the
time of evaluation, the patients had not received any specific
systemic treatment for at least 1 month.

Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). Four patients (three men
and one woman; mean age 37 years, range 25—44) with newly
diagnosed dermatitis herpetiformis were evaluated. The
diagnosis was established clinically, histologically, immunopathologically [direct immunofluorescence showing granular immunoglobulin (Ig)A deposits at the top of the dermal
papillae] and serologically (IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase
antibodies and IgA endomysial autoantibodies).

Primary cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). Five patients
(two men and three women; mean age 65 years, range 47-76)
with classic mycosis fungoides confirmed by histological,
immunohistochemical and molecular biology findings were
evaluated.

Normal controls. The study also involved 40 healthy subjects
(20 men and 20 women; mean age 50 years, range 32-78) as
a control group.

Blood sampling. Sodium citrate anti-coagulated plasma
samples taken from all patients and normal subjects were
stored in plastic cones at —20°C until in vitro assay, as were
the sodium citrate anti-coagulated blister fluid samples
taken from all BP patients.

The protocol was approved by our Institutional Review
Board, and all subjects gave their informed consent before
participating in the study.

Measurements

Prothrombin fragment 1+2. Prothrombin F1+2 levels were
measured using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) (Enzygnost F1+2; Behring Diagnostic GmbH,
Frankfurt, Germany) whose intra- and interassay coefficients of variation (CV) are, respectively, 5% and 8%.

p-dimer. p-dimer levels were measured using an ELISA
(Zymutest p-dimer; Hyphen BioMed, Neuville-sur-Oise,
France) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
The intra- and interassay CVs were, respectively, 10% and
15%.

Immunohistochemistry

The skin specimens were obtained from early-appearing
lesions and the controls were normal skin tissue specimens
taken from 20 patients undergoing excision of benign skin
tumours The tissue samples were fixed in buffered formalin,

dehydrated, embedded in paraffin wax and sectioned. TF
reactivity was assessed using as primary antibody mouse
anti-human TF (American Diagnostica Inc., Greenwich, CT,
USA), as secondary antibody an anti-rabbit and anti-mouse
immunoglobulin (Dako EnVision™ FLEX/HRP; Dako Cytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) and a peroxidase staining for
revealing. The negative control was a pool of mouse immunoglobulins (IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgM) as primary antibody (negative control; Dako Cytomation, Glostrup,
Denmark). TF immunoreactivity was scored on the basis of
the number of immunoreactive cells per field (x200): 0 = no
immunoreactive cells; 1=1-—5 immunoreactive cells;
2 =6~20 immunoreactive cells; and 3 => 20 immunoreactive cells.

Immunofluorescence studies using laser scanning
confocal microscopy

Sections of frozen unfixed tissue (4 um thick) from 10 BP
patients and five normal controls were flattened over a
gelatin-coated glass slide and fixed with acetone. The sections were then incubated with goat anti-CD125 antibody
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and mouse anti-TF antibody (American Diagnostica, Stamford, CT, USA) and
stained with secondary Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey
anti-goat (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and rhodamineconjugated donkey anti-mouse antibodies (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA, USA). Confocal microscopy was carried out
using a Radiance 2100 laser scanning confocal microscope
(Biorad Laboratories, Hercules CA, USA) equipped with a
krypton/argon laser.

Statistical analyses

As the plasma measurements were positively skewed, they
were log-transformed before analysis. The F1+2 and p-dimer
results are given as anti-log values of mean values with standard deviation (s.d.). Student’s t-test for unpaired data was
used to assess the statistical significance of the differences
between the patients and normal controls. Correlations were
assessed by means of least-squares linear regression. The
differences in the immunoreactivity scores were evaluated
using the Wilcoxon—Mann-Whitney non-parametric test. A
P-value of < 0-05 was considered as indicating a statistically
significant difference or correlation.

(P=0-0001 for both) (Fig. 2). There was a significant correlation between plasma F1+2 levels and the number of blood
eosinophils (r= 0-371, P= 0-006). Plasma F1+2 levels also
correlated positively with disease severity (expressed as the
percentage of body surface area involved) (r=0-555,
P=0-0001) and circulating anti-BP 180 antibodies
(r= 0-431, P=0-0001). The 16 BP patients evaluated before
and after immunosuppressive therapy leading to complete
remission showed a marked reduction in plasma F1+2 levels
(from 502 + 522 pmol/l to 184 + 214 pmol/l; P= 0-001)
(Fig. 2), accompanied by the normalization of circulating
eosinophil and anti-BP180 antibody levels.

Plasma F1+2 levels were higher in the patients with CU
(703 + 394 pmol/l), AD (318 + 170 pmol/l) and CDRs
(432 +560 pmol/l) than in the normal controls
(P=0-0001), but were not statistically different from those
observed in the patients with BP. Conversely, normal F1+2
levels were found in the patients with non-eosinophilmediated cutaneous diseases, including _ psoriasis
(95 + 53 pmol/l), DH (95+27 pmol/l) and CTCL
(146 + 72 pmol/l) (Fig. 1).

(153 + 50 ng/ml) and CTCL (304 + 92 nmol/l) (Fig. 3).

Skin TF expression

Immunohistochemical experiments. The immunohistochemical experiments revealed TF reactivity in the specimens
taken from the BP patients (Fig. 4a,d), whereas the normal
skin samples showed no TF reactivity at all (P = 0-0001). The
results were also negative in the patients with BP when the
anti-TF antibody was replaced by a pool of non-specific
mouse immunoglobulins (Fig. 4c). TF expression was less
intense in specimens taken from the patients with CU
(P=0-0001), AD (P=0-001) and CDRs (P=0-01). The
samples taken from the patients with non-eosinophil-driven
psoriasis (Fig. 4d), DH and CTCL were negative.

indicating that they were eosinophils (Fig. 5). It is also worth
noting that there were a few cells expressing TF or CD 125

other than eosinophils and the latter eosinphils that were
probably insufficiently activated to express TF.

systemically (i.e. in plasma) along with the presence of eosinophil granulocytes expressing TF in the BP inflammatory
infiltrate. Activated coagulation was also found in patients
with other inflammatory skin diseases in which eosinophils
are considered to play a role, but not in those with
eosinophil-unrelated skin diseases.

The prominent infiltrating cells in BP skin lesions are
eosinophils, although there are also various inflammatory
cells, particularly activated CD4* T cells with the functional
features of T helper type 2 (Th2) lymphocytes [11,12].
Patients with BP show increased expression and release of
cytokines and soluble factors involved in chemotaxis and
eosinophil activation, including interleukin (IL)-5, IL-16
and eotaxin [11,13]. Moreover, eosinophil-derived matrix
metalloproteinases, elastase and gelatinase may contribute to
tissue damage and blister formation [14—16]. Our preliminary data [2,6] suggested that eosinophils may act via pathomechanisms other than the release of the proteolytic
enzymes stored in their granules. The immunohistochemical
investigations made in the present study revealed TF expression in the lesional skin of BP patients, and immunofluorescence studies using laser scanning confocal microscopy
showed its localization in eosinophils. The role of TF in
initiating extrinsic blood coagulation leads to the intriguing
hypothesis that the TF-mediated coagulation pathway may
be involved in BP [2,17]. The observed activation of the
extrinsic coagulation pathway generates thrombin, an
enzyme that increases the permeability of blood vessels [18],
and the presence of thrombin may play a role in the pathogenesis of BP by increasing vascular permeability and
favouring the transendothelial migration of inflammatory
cells and their accumulation in the skin. Activated proteases,
in turn, act on protease-activated receptors (PARs) and
induce the expression of various proinflammatory cytokines, and this cross-talk between inflammation and coagulation amplifies and maintains the activation of both systems
[19]. Hypercoagulability may therefore contribute to inflammation, tissue damage and blister formation, although other
pathomechanisms have been suggested to link eosinophils
and hypercoagulability, involving endothelium, platelets and
coagulation itself [20].

Our data also confirm previous observations of coagulation activation in the active phase of CU, particularly in
more severe cases [21-24]. The expression of TF in the
lesional skin of CU patients reflects the degree of eosinophil
infiltration, as confirmed by our previous studies [25].

Our patients with CDRs also showed increased plasma
F1+2 and p-dimer levels, but these are associated with less
intense and variable TF expression in lesional skin, due possibly to the heterogeneity of the clinicopathological patterns
included under the umbrella term of cutaneous drug
reactions.

AD is characterized by coagulation activation and skin
TF expression only in its erythrodermic forms, and is
regarded as a Th2-mediated skin disease [26] in which it is

likely that eosinophils play a relevant role only in extensive
cases.

Similar behaviour may be found in DH, which is considered to be a Th1/Th2 skin disorder in which neutrophils are
thought to be the major effector cells mediating inflammation, with eosinophils playing only an ancillary role [27,28].
In fact, our patients with only mild clinical pictures did not
show any systemic activation of coagulation or skin TF
expression, although it has been suggested that coagulation
activation plays a role in the pathogenesis of DH [29].

Finally, TF was not expressed in the lesional skin of our
patients with psoriasis vulgaris, despite its extensive clinical
presentation and high PASI index. This is in line with the
profile of the effector cells in this disease, which is currently
considered to be a Th1/Th17 condition, with neutrophils but
not eosinophils contributing to its pathogenesis [30]. At systemic level, the inflammation related to psoriasis may be
associated with the activation of coagulation, but we were
not able to demonstrate this as our patients had normal
plasma F1+2 and p-dimer levels. Nevertheless, high levels of
the biomarkers of activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis
have been found previously in patients with psoriasis [31],
which suggests that they may play a role in the increased risk
of cardiovascular events associated with the disease. High
levels of the markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis activation are found in many inflammatory conditions, not only
cutaneous disorders but also systemic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis [32], inflammatory bowel diseases [33] and
sepsis [34]. This means that different diseases share an intermediate stage in their pathophysiology which can occur at
different sites; for example, eosinophils express TF that can
activate coagulation in the skin microenvironment of
patients with BP and CU, with the generation of vascular
permeability mediators.

Our patients with CTCL of the mycosis fungoides type
showed no TF expression in the lesional skin and the levels of
the plasma biomarkers of coagulation and fibrinolysis were
normal, regardless of disease stage. These findings are in line
with the fact that there are usually no or only a few eosinophils in skin biopsy specimens of classic mycosis fungoides.

The systemic involvement of coagulation (potentially
leading to a prothrombotic state) may have important clinical implications in BP, because various data indicate that BP
is characterized by an increased thrombotic risk [7,8]. Conversely, no data are available concerning the incidence of
thrombotic complications in patients with CU and further
studies are needed. Retrospective evaluation of our patients
with BP has shown an increased incidence of venous thrombosis [2,6] and, although most of them are elderly, the incidence seems to be significantly higher than in a population
of otherwise healthy subjects of the same age [2,6]. The
increased incidence of venous thrombosis in BP patients
raises the question as to whether anti-coagulant treatment in
combination with conventional immunosuppressive therapy
is indicated in this disease.
