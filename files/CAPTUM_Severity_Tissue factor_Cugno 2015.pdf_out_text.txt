Abstract

Coagulation activation has been demonstrated in two prototypic autoimmune skin diseases,
chronic autoimmune urticaria and bullous pemphigoid, but only the latter is associated with
increased thrombotic risk. Two markers of coagulation activation (prothrombin fragment F1
+2 and fibrin fragment D-dimer) were measured by immunoenzymatic methods in plasma
samples from 30 patients with active chronic autoimmune urticaria, positive for autologous
serum skin test, 30 patients with active bullous pemphigoid and 30 healthy subjects. In skin
biopsies, tissue factor expression was evaluated by both immunohistochemistry and in situ
hybridization. F1+2 and D-dimer levels were higher in active chronic autoimmune urticaria
(276.5489.8 pmol/L and 5.56+4.40 nmol/L, respectively) than in controls (145.2+38.0 pmol/
Land 1.0640.25 nmol/L; P=0.029 and P=0.011) and were much higher in active bullous
pemphigoid (691.7+318.7 pmol/L and 15.24+9.09 nmol/L, respectively) (P<0.0001). Tissue
factor positivity was evident in skin biopsies of both disorders with higher intensity in bullous
pemphigoid. F1+2 and D-dimer, during remission, were markedly reduced in both disorders.
These findings support the involvement of coagulation activation in the pathophysiology of
both diseases. The strong systemic activation of coagulation in bullous pemphigoid may
contribute to increase the thrombotic risk and provides the rationale for clinical trials on anticoagulant treatments in this disease.

Introduction

Evidence exists on the close link among the immune response, inflammation and coagulation
[1,2]. Proinflammatory mediators induce the expression of tissue factor (TF), the main initiator
of blood coagulation, while activated proteases of coagulation trigger inflammation [3]. Such a
cross-talk amplifies and maintains the activation of both systems, and is potentially involved in
the pathophysiology of autoimmune skin diseases, such as chronic autoimmune urticaria
(CAU) and bullous pemphigoid (BP).

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a skin disorder characterized by the recurrent eruption of shortlived wheals accompanied by redness and itching for at least 6 weeks (Fig 1A) [4]. The disease
can be classified as spontaneous and inducible CU [5]. Considering spontaneous CU, experimental and clinical findings have supported an autoimmune origin in about 40% of cases [6,7].
In these chronic autoimmune urticaria (CAU) patients, circulating histamine-releasing autoantibodies directed against IgE (anti-IgE) or against the a subunit of the high—affinity IgE receptor (anti-FceRI) have been demonstrated in-vitro by immunoblotting, enzyme immunoassay
and basophil histamine-release assay [8-11] and are associated with positivity of autologous
serum skin test (ASST) in-vivo [12]. Mast cells activated primarily by histamine-releasing autoantibodies secrete proinflammatory mediators, including histamine, tryptase, leukotriene C4,
interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-o [13]. Along with autoimmune mechanisms mediated by autoantibodies, inflammation is also involved as supported by increased levels of C reactive protein and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) [14,15]. Recently, evidence of the
possible involvement of the coagulation cascade in the pathogenesis of CU has emerged [1619]. CU patients show elevated plasma levels of prothrombin fragment F1+2, suggesting
thrombin generation [16]. In subsequent studies we found that CU patients show an activation
of the TF pathway of coagulation cascade [17], and that in patients with severe disease such activation can be so pronounced as to produce an elevation of plasma levels of D-dimer, the last
being regarded as a sign of fibrinolysis [18]. The activation of the TF pathway of coagulation results in turn in the generation of thrombin which, in experimental models, has been shown to
induce edema [20,21] and release of inflammatory mediators [15].

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune disease presenting with blisters and urticarialike skin lesions (Fig 1B); it occurs typically in elderly and is burdened with a high risk of death,

Coagulation Activation and Thrombotic Risk in Autoimmune Skin Diseases

 

due mainly to infectious complications and cardiovascular events [22,23]. The pathophysiology
of BP is linked to production of autoantibodies directed against two hemidesmosomal antigens,
BP180 and BP230, with complement activation and leucocyte skin infiltration playing an important role [22,24,25]. Both T cells and B cells with autoreactivity towards BP180/BP230 are
necessary for its pathogenesis [26]. During acute phase of BP, autoreactive T helper (Th) 1 and
Th 2 lymphocytes cooperatively play a role in the development of the disease process [27]. Recently, a focus has been placed on the possible contribution of the newly discovered Th 17 subset to the pathophysiology of BP [28-31]. Moreover, a reduction of T regulatory cells, whose
immunosurveillance action is critical in preventing autoimmunity, has been observed in
lesional skin of BP patients [30]. Finally, also the activation of the coagulation cascade at skin
level seems to be involved in the disease pathophysiology. In fact, an increase in the prothrombotic markers F1 + 2 and D-dimer concentrations has been found in blister fluid samples [25].
The expression of TF in BP skin specimens suggests its role in initiating blood coagulation also
in this disease. Coagulation activation may contribute to tissue damage and blister formation
by the generation of thrombin. In plasma samples from BP patients, Fl + 2 and D-dimer levels
were also increased, although to a lesser extent than in blister fluids [25]. Based on these findings, coagulation activation in BP patients could contribute to inflammation, tissue damage,
blister formation and potentially to thrombosis.

The main aim of this study was to assess and compare the plasma markers of coagulation
activation by means of immunoenzymatic methods, and lesional TF expression by means of
immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, between CAU and BP, two immune-mediated diseases that share the involvement of coagulation in their pathophysiology but differ in
clinical and prognostic features.

Patients and Methods
Patients

Chronic autoimmune urticaria (CAU). Thirty patients with CAU (13 men and 17
women, median age 43 years, range 23-63), admitted to the Dermatology Department from
January 2012 to December 2014, were selected for the study. CAU was diagnosed on the basis
of the recurrence of spontaneous weals with or without angioedema for more than 6 weeks. All
the included patients were characterized by positivity of autologous serum skin test. Patients
with physical urticaria and urticarial vasculitis were excluded. All patients had active urticaria
at the time of the study. Patients had not been given systemic corticosteroids and anti-histamines for at least 1 week. Disease activity was estimated according to the number of weals present at the time when blood samples from these patients were collected, as follows: 1-10 small
(<3 cm in diameter) weals = grade 1 (mild); 10-50 small weals or 1-10 large weals = grade 2
(moderate); and >50 small weals or >10 large weals = grade 3 (severe).

Skin biopsy specimens were taken from wheals lasting from 3 to 12 h.

In 10 patients, blood samples were taken also during disease remission.

Bullous pemphigoid (BP). Thirty patients with previously untreated active BP (14 men
and 16 women, median age 73 years, range 58-88) admitted to the Dermatology Department
from January 2012 to December 2014 were included. The diagnosis of BP was established on
the basis of clinical and immunopathological criteria. All the patients had a clinical picture of
generalized BP without any mucous membrane involvement (median disease duration: 1
month, range 0-2); the skin lesions (vesiculobullous and/or erythematous—oedematous lesions) covered a median 35% of total body area (range 20-50%). Direct immunofluorescence
examinations of the perilesional skin revealed the linear deposition of IgG and/or C3 in the
BMZ in all cases, circulating anti-BP180 autoantibodies were detected by means of an ELISA.

Coagulation Activation and Thrombotic Risk in Autoimmune Skin Diseases

 

Concomitant neoplastic or inflammatory diseases were excluded on the basis of clinical and instrumental examinations. None of the patients had thyroid dysfunction or atrial fibrillation
nor were taking drugs affecting coagulation.

At blood sampling, active BP patients were taking neither immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory agents nor anticoagulant drugs.

Skin specimens were obtained from the early appearing lesions (<24 h) of all patients with
BP. After taking blood and skin samples, patients with active disease were treated with methylprednisolone at an initial dose of 0-5-0-75 mg/kg/day. When either new lesions or pruritic
symptoms have not occurred for at least 2 weeks, the tapering of steroid was started until
reaching the minimal dose of 0-05-0-1 mg/kg/day.

In 10 patients, blood samples were taken during clinical remission. At the time of the reevaluation sampling, the patients were receiving low-dose corticosteroids.

Normal controls. Thirty healthy subjects (15 men and 15 women, median age 55 years,
range 21-83) served as normal controls for plasmatic studies. Specimens of normal skin from 20
patients who underwent excision of benign skin tumors were used as controls for tissue studies.

Blood sampling

Sodium citrate anticoagulated plasma samples taken from all CAU and BP patients and from
normal subjects were stored in plastic cones at -20°C until in vitro assay.

The study was approved by the local Review Board of Internal Medicine, Dermatology, Allergy and Clinical Immunology of the University of Milan, Italy, and all of the subjects gave
their written informed consent.

Methods

Prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2) measurements. F1+2 levels were measured using a
sandwich ELISA (Enzygnost F1+2; Behring Diagnostic GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany), with
intra- and interassay coefficients of variation (CV) of 5% and 8%, respectively.

D-Dimer measurements. D-Dimer levels were measured by means of ELISA (Zymutest
D-dimer; Hyphen BioMed, Neuville-sur-Oise, France) in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions. The intra- and interassay CV were 10% and 15%, respectively.

C-reactive protein (CRP) determination. CRP plasma concentration was measured using
a sandwich enzyme immunoassay (Zymutest CRP, Hyphen BioMed, Neuville-sur-Oise,
France). Intra- and inter-assay variability was lower than 11%.

Blood eosinophil count. The absolute eosinophil number in peripheral blood was measured with a SE 9000 electronic counter (Sysmex Co., Kobe, Japan), and expressed as the number of cells/ul.

Immunohistochemical studies. The tissue samples were fixed in buffered formalin, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin wax and sectioned; no antigen unmasking pretreatment was
needed. After deparaffining and rehydrating, each tissue section was placed on a Dako automated immunostainer (Dako Cytomation, Glostrup, Denmark), and incubated with the specific monoclonal antibody (mouse antihuman TF 1: 100; American Diagnostica Inc., Greenwich,
CT, U.S.A.) at room temperature for 45 min, and then washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS),
pH 7.6, and incubated in biotinylated goat antimouse and antirabbit immunoglobulins (Dako
REAL, code K5005) at room temperature for 30 min. After incubation with the secondary antibody and another washing with TBS, pH 7.6, the sections were incubated with streptavidin
conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Dako REAL, code K5005) at room temperature for 30
min. A red chromogen solution was prepared as indicated by the Dako REAL datasheet and
used as an enzyme substrate, followed by counterstaining with Mayer’s haematoxylin. After air

drying, each section was coverslipped using the VectaMount mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, U.S.A.). A negative control was performed using a pool of mouse immunoglobulins (IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgM) as primary antibody (negative control; Dako
Cytomation). Two independent ‘blinded’ observers evaluated the serial sections. TF immunoreactivity was scored according to the number of immunoreactive cells per field (200x) as follows: 0 = no immunoreactive cells, 1 = 1-5 immunoreactive cells, 2 = 6-20 immunoreactive
cells, 3 = >20 immunoreactive cells.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). To evaluate the tissue factor m-RNA in the
cells of the inflammatory infiltrate, the skin sections were subjected to in situ hybridization
using a RNA probe complementary to the m-RNA of tissue factor conjugated with fluorescein
isothiocyanate. After deparaffinization and rehydration, each section was incubated with a solution containing proteinase K for tissue digestion and placed in the thermal cycler at 37°C for
15 minutes. After washing with TBS, we performed an incubation with hybridization buffer in
the thermal cycler at 30°C for 4 hours, and then with a tissue factor specific probe at 30°C for
18 hours. After washing with stringency buffer at 40°C for 15 minutes, the preparations were
examined with a fluorescence microscope.

Statistics

Following previous studies in which CAU and BP patients were tested separately [18,25], we hypothesized a 30% difference in F1+2 mean plasma levels between CAU and BP. With a SD of
150 pmol/L, a two-tailed alpha error of 0.05 and a 80% power, a theoretical sample of 16 patients
per group was calculated. Taking into account possible technical problems related to sampling
and laboratory testing, the sample was increased up to 30 patients per group. Results are reported as mean values with standard deviation (SD) and were log-transformed before analysis
to approach a normal distribution. To compare mean plasma levels of F1+2, D-dimer and CRP
between the 3 study groups (controls, CAU and BP patients), ANOVA was used with Bonferroni’s post-hoc contrast analysis. Within-group comparisons (acute phase versus remission) was
made with Student’s t-test for paired groups. Differences in the immunohistochemical scores
were assessed using the Wilcoxon—Mann—Whitney nonparametric test. Correlation between
CRP and both F1+2 and D-dimer plasma levels was tested with the Spearman’s rank correlation
test. P < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference or correlation.

Results
Prothrombin fragment 1+2

The prothrombin F1+2 measurements are shown in Fig 2. Plasma F1+2 levels were higher in
active CAU patients (mean + SD: 276.5+89.8 pmol/L) than in normal controls (145.2+38.0
pmol/L) (Bonferroni’s post-hoc contrast: P = 0.029). Plasma F1+2 levels were much higher in
BP patients (691.74318.7 pmol/L, P<0.0001 for comparison with both controls and CAU patients). In the 10 patients observed during CAU remission, plasma levels significantly decreased compared with CAU exacerbation (from 396+100 pmol/l to 213432 pmol/l; P
<0.0001) (Fig 3). The 10 BP patients evaluated before and after immunosuppressive therapy
leading to complete disease remission had a significant reduction in plasma F1+2 levels at remission (from 711+76 pmol/l to 279+42 pmol/l; P<0.0001) (Fig 3).

D-dimer levels were higher in plasma of patients with active CAU (5.58+4.40 nmol/L) than in

the skin from a patient with CAU (panel A) and a patient with BP (panel B).

In situ hybridization. In situ hybridization using a RNA probe complementary to the
m-RNA of TF confirmed the expression of TF by inflammatory cells in the lesional skin of
3 BP patients and 3 CAU patients. Fig 8 reports examples of cells expressing mRNA of TF
which were more numerous in a patient with BP (panel D) than in a patient with CAU
(panel C).

In this study for the first time two autoimmune skin diseases have been compared in terms of

main initiator of blood coagulation, was found in both diseases. The activation of coagulation
was shown to parallel the disease activity in both CAU and BP; in fact, during remission, we
observed its normalization in both CAU and BP. These findings support the role of coagulation
activation in the pathophysiology of CAU and BP in agreement with previous observations
[17,25,31]. The stronger activation found in patients with BP may contribute to increase their
thrombotic risk.

Recently, using co-localization experiments, TF has been found to be expressed by eosinophils present in the inflammatory infiltrate of CAU and BP skin lesions [19,32]. This indicates
that eosinophils play a role as a source of TF, in line with studies showing that eosinophils
store TF and rapidly transfer it to the cell membrane during activation [33]. The strong expression of TF in CAU lesional skin may be due to eosinophil activation, even if patients with CAU
virtually never show peripheral eosinophilia, probably because TF specifically facilitates the
early transendothelial migration of the eosinophils [33]. Eosinophils are also important components of the BP inflammatory infiltrate, which also consists of numerous T lymphocytes and
few other inflammatory cells [34,35]. Notably, the T lymphocytes infiltrating lesional skin of

BP exhibit mainly a T helper type 2 (Th2) phenotype and produce cytokines and chemokines
inducing recruitment and activation of eosinophils, in particular interleukin-5 and eotaxin

36]. Consistent with this, TF-mediated coagulation pathway may be considered as a common
athogenetic event in both CAU and BP disease. The activation of the extrinsic coagulation
athway generates thrombin that may play a role in the pathogenesis of both diseases by increasing vascular permeability [37] and favouring the transendothelial migration of inflammatory cells and their accumulation in the skin [33]. In particular, in CAU, the generation of
thrombin induces edema by a direct effect on endothelial cells and indirectly by a thrombin-reated release of inflammatory mediators [13]. Most effects of thrombin are probably mediated
by histamine (and hence mast cell mediated), as they have been reported to be reduced by antihistamines and mast cell granule depletion in animal models [21]. On the other hand, in BP

 

hypercoagulability may contribute to inflammation, tissue damage and blister formation, al
 

though other pathomechanisms have been suggested to link eosinophils and hypercoagulability, involving endothelium, platelets and coagulation itself [38].

It is noteworthy that in plasma samples from CAU and BP patients included in the present
study, Fl+2 and D-dimer levels were significantly increased compared with normal controls,
indicating that the coagulation cascade is activated also at a systemic level, as previously found

hypercoagulable state related to coagulation activation in CAU and, to a higher extent, in BP

patients is an increased thrombotic risk. Indeed, it has been reported tl
is increased in patients with BP [44,45] and we have found an annual

 

at the risk of thrombosis
incidence of venous

thrombosis of 8% [25], clearly higher than that observed in the general elderly population

Fig 7. Scores of tissue factor immunoreactivity in tissue samples. Immunoreactivity for tissue factor was evaluated in tissue samples from skin lesions
of 20 patients with chronic autoimmune urticaria (CAU) and 20 patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP) compared with normal skin (20 cases). Both CAU and
BP patients showed a marked immunoreactivity for tissue factor (P = 0.0001); the reactivity was significantly higher in BP than in CAU (P = 0.027). Tissue
factor immunoreactivity was scored according to the number of immunoreactive cells per field (200X) as follows: O = No immunoreactive cells; | = 1-5
immunoreactive cells; 2 = 6-20 immunoreactive cells; 3 = >20 immunoreactive cells.

(0-28-0-41% per year) [46]. Interestingly, in the CAU patients evaluated during activity and remission, both Fl + 2 and D-dimer plasma levels significantly decreased during remission. Similarly, prothrombotic marker plasma levels markedly decrease during disease remission
obtained with immunosuppressive treatment in BP patients. Based on these findings, it may be
hypothesized that the reduction in coagulation activation observed after treatment may not
only contribute to the healing of the cutaneous manifestations, but also to the reduction of
thrombotic risk.

The limitation of the present study is the relatively small number of patients included, but
this is counterbalanced by the high mean difference in F1+2 and D-dimer plasma levels between CAU and BP patients, which can be demonstrated with enough power with this sample
size.

In conclusion, in the present study the measurement of biomarkers of coagulation activation
confirmed that the coagulation cascade is systemically activated in the acute phase of such inflammatory cutaneous disorders as CAU and BP. These diseases differ in the strength of coagulation activation at a systemic level, being significantly increased in BP which is burdened with

 

a high thrombotic risk.

Fig 8. Immunohistochemical studies and in situ hybridization. Tissue factor expression was evaluated in lesional skin of chronic autoimmune urticaria
and bullous pemphigoid. Immunohistochemical studies showed tissue factor reactivity in both chronic autoimmune urticaria (panel A) and bullous
pemphigoid (panel B) (original magnification, X 200). In situ hybridization showed m-RNA of tissue factor, confirming a higher expression by inflammatory
cells in bullous pemphigoid (panel D) than in chronic autoimmune urticaria (panel C).
