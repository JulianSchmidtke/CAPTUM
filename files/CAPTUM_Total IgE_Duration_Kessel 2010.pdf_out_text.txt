Chronic urticaria - IgE levels - Autologous serum skin test

Abstract

Background: Elevated IgE levels in patients with chronic urticaria have been noted previously, but the significance of
these findings has not been appreciated. Objective: To measure the IgE levels in such patients and to examine the relationship between these levels and urticarial severity, autologous serum skin test, anti-thyroid antibodies and duration.
Methods: Serum total IgE levels from 203 patients with
chronic urticaria were measured and compared with nonatopic individuals. Additionally, patients were assessed for
urticarial severity, the presence of autologous serum skin
test and anti-thyroid antibodies. Results: Of the chronic urticaria patients, 47 (23.2%) were classified as mild, whereas
67 (33%) were classified as having moderate and 89 (43.8%)
as having severe chronic urticaria. Total IgE levels were elevated, above 175 U/ml, in 69/203 (34%) of patients, compared
with 7/81 (8.6%) of healthy controls (p < 0.001). A significant
association between increased total IgE and chronic urticaria severity was found. Whereas 93% of patients with increased level of total IgE suffered from moderate-to-severe
chronic urticaria, this was observed in only 69% of patients
with normal IgE (p< 0.0001). Autologous serum skin test and
anti-thyroid antibodies were positive in 59/163 (36%) and
28/189 (15%) patients, respectively. A significant association

between increased total IgE levels and the presence of autologous serum skin test, anti-thyroid antibodies and urticarial duration lasting more than 25 months (p < 0.0001, p<
0.0001 and p = 0.021, respectively) was also detected. Conclusions: Total serum IgE levels are frequently elevated in
patients with chronic urticaria and these are associated with
disease severity and duration. Copyright © 2010S. Karger AG, Basel

Introduction

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common disabling disorder occurring in about 0.5-1% of the population at some
time during their life [1]. More than half of those CU cases in which the etiology was initially considered idiopathic are subsequently reclassified as autoimmune. The existence of autoantibodies against both IgE and FceRIa on
cutaneous mast cells, characterized by their ability to
cause a direct mast cell degranulation lends support to
the autoimmune nature of this disorder [2, 3]. It is important to note that the ability of anti-IgE antibodies to degranulate mast cell was previously reported in rheumatoid arthritis synovial mast cells [4]. Sera from patients
with CU released significant amounts of histamine (>15%
of basal levels) upon incubation with basophils (48%) and
mast cells (46%). Moreover, while the presence of antiFceRIa autoantibodies is considered to be the main fac

tor responsible for the 30-40% positivity of the autologous serum skin test (ASST) among CU patients, other
unidentified serum factors are also believed to play a significant role [5, 6]. Subsequent research has characterized
CU in the broader context of an immune-mediated disorder. Our group previously described the polyclonal activation of both B and T lymphocytes as evident by the
increased production of unrelated autoantibodies such as
anti-thyroid antibodies, the increased CD40L expression
on T cells as well as the overexpression of Bcl-2 in both B
and T cells [7]. Confino-Cohen et al. [8] reported aberrant signaling in the P21Ras pathway in lymphocytes of
patients with CU. Finally, we reported that CD4+ T cells
from CU are in an ‘activation state’ and their close proximity to mast cells may trigger extensive mast cell deregulation with subsequent elevations in serum MMP-9, especially among those with severe CU [9].

Our group also reported that total serum IgE levels were
increased in some CU patients, however, this finding was
not attributed to a specific antigen trigger, but rather the
result of the B cell polycloncal activation [10]. Notably,
while elevated IgE levels have been noted in several previous studies, primarily in children, the significance of these
findings has not been appreciated to date and therefore
their measurement does not constitute part of the standard
evaluation of CU patients [11-14]. In this large prospective
study, we demonstrate that CU adult patients not only have
increased levels of total IgE, but that their levels correlate
with disease severity. We interpret these finding to indicate that total IgE may be regarded as a potential marker
of this immune-mediated disorder and also discuss the
role of IgE in the mediation of mast cell degranulation.

Methods

Patients

This prospective study included 217 CU patients who were followed by 5 senior allergists in 3 large secondary referral outpatient
allergy clinics from 1999 until 2008. The follow-up time ranged
from 3 to 9 years, with a mean duration of 24.73 + 29 months.
Patients with pure physical urticaria, food or food additive intolerance were excluded from the study. Patients with presumed
chronic infection were also excluded on the basis of a detailed history, an extensive physical examination as well as laboratory tests
such as stool culture and elevated serum eosinophils.

A detailed past medical history and family history of airborne
or food allergy, including skin prick tests (SPT) for a wide range
of allergens, was also obtained. All patients underwent an immune-related laboratory work-up consisting of: anti-thyroglobulin and thyroid microsomal antibodies (ATA) detected by ELISA
(Orgentec Diagnostika GmbH, Mainz, Germany), total IgE measured by a Ridascreen, ELISA kit (R-Biopharm, Darmstadt, Ger

many). Notably, while the upper normal limit of serum IgE is 100
U/ml, we considered only levels above 175 U/ml to be significantly elevated, thereby excluding ‘borderline’ antibody elevations.

Patient’s IgE levels were compared to an age- and sex-matched
control group comprising 81 healthy volunteers [49 female (60%),
32 male (40%)] with a mean age of 45 + 18 without known atopic disease, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis.
Our control group (companions of the patients, employees of the
clinics) was recruited from all 3 allergy and immunology clinics
over the same time period the study was conducted. The laboratory tests, ASST and SPT were performed during the evaluation
of the patients at the beginning of the follow-up. The local Committee on Human Experimentation approved the study. Oral consent was obtained from the study participants.

Autologous Serum Skin Test

ASST was performed in 173/207 (83.5%) studied patients (after
appropriate antihistamine washout) as previously described [15].
Briefly, 0.05 ml of sterile autologous serum was injected intradermally, and the wheal size recorded at 30 min. Patients were then
followed for an additional hour. Both negative and positive controls were injected with saline and histamine (1 mg/ml), respectively. ASST was considered positive when the wheal size diameter
was at least 1.5 mm greater than the negative control. ASST was
not done in patients who could not stop their antihistamine therapy or refused to undergo this procedure.

Skin Prick Test

Sensitization to food and inhaled allergens was determined
by performing skin prick reactivity, in conjunction with positive
and negative controls, histamine phosphate 2.75 mg/ml (contains glycerin 50% (v/v) and 0.9% w/v saline, respectively (ALK
ABELLO Port Washington, N.Y., USA).

The inhaled allergens panel consisted of house dust mite (Dermatophagoides farine, D. pteronyssinus), mixed weeds (Pigweed,
Lambs quarters, Sagebrush, Plaintain, Nettle, Wall pellitory, Cocklebur), mixed grass (Bermuda, Johnson, Orchard, Timothy) mixed
trees (olive, cypress, pecan, oak, acacia, cottonwood, Casuarina)
mixed molds (Cladosporium, Alternaria, Aspergillus), dog, cat and
cockroach extracts. The food panel included cacao, milk, soya, egg,
goat milk, peanut, sesame, mix fish, mix cereals, peanut, pecan,
coconut, almond, brazil nut, strawberry, banana, grapes, peach,
melon, beef, turkey, chicken, orange, potato, lettuce, tomato, onion, mushroom, pea, cabbage, vanilla, cinnamon, mustard, garlic
and black pepper. Reactions to the allergens were read after 15 min.
Mean diameters were calculated as the mean of the widest diameter and the perpendicular diameter measured at its midpoint.
Wheals with a mean diameter greater or equal to 3 mm than those
of the negative control were considered positive reactions [16].

Urticaria Score

All patients were scored on a 4-point scale as previously described by Breneman et al. [17]. Briefly, this scale takes into consideration the number of lesions, number of separate episodes, average
size of lesions, average duration of lesions and pruritus as follows:
0 =no symptoms; 1 = mild urticaria (1-4 points); 2 = moderate urticaria (5-9 points); 3 = severe urticaria (10 points) [17]. The urticaria score was performed at the begging of the follow-up, while the
patients were taking their usual antihistamine treatment.

Statistical Analysis

The comparison between total IgE levels in CU patients and
the control group was analyzed by Student t test. Associations between categorical variables including increased total IgE, CU severity, the presence of ASST and ATA were evaluated using the x?
test or Fisher’s exact test as needed. Two-tailed p values of 0.05 or
less were considered to be statistically significant.

Results

Two hundred and seventeen patients with CU of at
least 3 months duration were enrolled in the study. SPT
to food and inhaled allergens was performed in 164/217
(75.5%) patients and was positive in 17/164 (10.3%). In 14
of the 17 patients (82.3%) with a positive SPT, IgE levels
were also elevated (369 + 166 U/ml). These patients were
subsequently excluded from the analysis given the strong
possibility that their elevated IgE levels stem from their
atopy. In 53 additional patients, SPT was not performed.
These patients were not thought to be atopic due to the
absence of any relevant medical history or clinical data
and the fact that their IgE levels were normal. The final
analysis, therefore, was conducted on a total of 203 patients, which included 130 females (64%) and 73 males
(36%) with a mean age of 47 + 15 years.

Eighty-seven patients (42.8%) were scored as severe
CU, 69 (34%) as moderate CU and 47 (23.2%) were scored
as suffering from mild CU.

Total IgE levels in the serum of patients with CU was
significantly higher compared to the healthy controls (182
+ 16.12 vs. 65.36 + 5.4, p < 0.0001; fig. 1). In addition,
34% (69/203) of our patients had elevated levels of total IgE
(above 175 U/ml) compared to 8.6% (7/81) in the control
group p < 0.001. Rates of ASST and ATA positivity were
found in 59/163 (36%) and 28/189 (15%), respectively.

The association of increased total IgE with CU severity: whereas 59% (41/69) of patients with increased level
of IgE suffered from severe CU, only 36% (48/134) of patients with normal IgE level had severe CU (p = 0.0001).
Similarly, mild CU was documented in higher percentages of patients with normal IgE compared to patients
with higher levels of IgE: 7% (5/69) vs. 31% (42/134); p =
0.0001 (fig. 2).

The association of increased total IgE with ASST: when
ASST was analyzed in relation to IgE levels, a higher percentage of positive ASST was found in patients with higher levels of IgE compared to patients with normal levels of
IgE: 58% (31/53) vs. 25% (28/110); p = 0.0001 (fig. 3).

The association of increased total IgE with ATA: when
ATA was analyzed in relation to IgE levels, we found sig

The association of increased total IgE with CU duration: when CU duration, lasting more than 25 months,
was analyzed in relation to IgE levels, we found significantly higher percentage of elevated IgE levels in patients

23% (31/132); p = 0.021 (fig. 5).

Additionally, we found an association between CU severity and the presence of ASST, ATA and CU duration.
In patients with mild CU, 3/35 (8.5%) had a positive ASST
compared to 9/50 (18%) patients with moderate CU and
47/78 (60%) patients with severe CU (p < 0.001). In patients with mild CU, 2/39 (5.1%) had positive ATA compared to 26/150 (17.3%) patients with moderate-to-severe
CU (p < 0.001). Furthermore, CU severity was found to
be associated with CU duration. In patients with mild
CU, 4/45 (8.8%) had CU duration lasting more than 25
months compared to 14/67 (20.8%) patients with moderate CU and 40/88 (45.4%) patients with severe CU (p<
0.001).

Discussion

In this study we found that one third of patients with
CU had significantly elevated levels of total IgE compared
with our control group. Moreover, 93% of CU patients
with high-elevated IgE had moderate to severe urticaria.
The IgE levels of the control patients observed in our
study are similar to the levels detected in an earlier study
conducted in Israel where it was reported that only 10%
of normal control had elevated IgE levels, a rate similar to

European and North American countries [18]. In agreement with our previous report, CU severity was found to
be associated with the presence of positive ASST and ATA
as well as CU duration [10]. In this study, patient’s clinical
history and SPT results were used to assess atopy. We
cannot exclude the possibility that measurement of specific IgE to the tested allergens or performing SPT with
additional less common allergens may identify a few additional individuals with atopy. Nevertheless, it should be

noted that while RAST for IgE testing is highly specific,
it is considered less sensitive than percutaneous tests [19].

Our finding of elevated levels of total IgE in patients
with CU and their association with both CU severity and
ASST positivity is notable for several reasons. First, these
findings lend support to the notion that rather than being
a discrete disorder, CU is best regarded as a composite of
a wide range of immune-mediated disorders. Second, the
association between total IgE and CU severity, as well as
its association with the presence of ASST and ATA positivity suggests that total IgE might be used as a marker
for CU severity in patients without atopic diseases. As
such, the testing of IgE levels should be considered to become routine when CU patients are evaluated. Finally, a
noteworthy clinical implication of our findings is that it
may be possible to treat CU patients with an anti-IgE
therapy, namely omalizumab. This drug reduces serum
levels of free IgE and downregulates the expression of IgE
receptors (FceRIa) on mast cells and basophils, thereby
ultimately leading to the reduction of mast cell and subsequent T and B cell activity [20-25].

The link between IgE levels and CU severity may be
explained by the effect of IgE on mast cell activation and
degranulation. While traditionally, IgE binding to
FceRIa was regarded as a passive action of sensitization
before receptor aggregation by an antigen occurred, recent findings, mostly in murine bone marrow-derived
mast cells, have demonstrated that binding of different
monomeric IgE molecules to their receptors (FceRIa)
triggers a spectrum of receptor aggregation and mast cell

 

292 Int Arch Allergy Immunol 2010;153:288-293

activation regardless of the specific antigen. This phenomenon induces upregulation of cell surface expression
of FceRIa, increases mast cell survival and their histamine content and increases histamine as well as leukotriene release. Notably, these non-Ag-specific IgE-mediated events are 2-3 logs stronger than those induced by
Ag-dependent activation [26]. While some of these aforementioned IgEs are highly cytokinergic and their binding was followed by a higher aggregation and production
of cytokines rendering these mast cells resistant to apoptosis in an autocrine fashion, other IgEs have resulted in
a modest cytokinergic effect [27].

Similarly, in a recent study, culture of bone marrow
cells in the presence of monomeric IgEs resulted in an increased number of mast cells, compared with cultures devoid of these antibodies. In this respect, monomeric IgE
both promote mast cell development and modulate the
mast cell phenotype derived from mice [28]. Apparently,
the increased expression and density of FceRIa on mast
cells from patients with CU following the elevation of IgE
renders these cells more sensitive to the binding of autoantibodies against FceRIa. Moreover, in CU patients, the excessive serum IgE antibodies saturate the mast cells thereby resulting in the IgE’s increased binding of IgG autoantibodies. However, we should consider the possibility that
some of the autoantibodies against the high-affinity IgE
receptor are competitive with IgE for the binding to the
IgE receptor. Thus, in summary, total IgE might serve as a
useful tool to assess CU severity and should be considered
to be obtained as part of the standard patient work-up.

The anti-inflammatory effect of omalizumab and its
possible clinical benefit for CU patients emphasizes the
fundamental importance of serum IgE and its association
with urticaria severity. Omalizumab treatment was also
shown to be associated with downregulation of IgE receptors on circulating (precursor) dendritic cells, suggesting that blocking IgE may inhibit some of the more
chronic aspects of inflammation such as the T cell-induced one, so instrumental in severe CU [29]. Preliminary clinical trials have shown that omalizumab was beneficial in CU patients, regardless of their IgE levels [2125]. In line with our finding, we speculate that clinicians
might achieve a better response to omalizumab in those
severe CU patients with elevated IgE levels.

Overall, our findings of elevated IgE levels in CU patients suggest that CU should be regarded as an immunemediated disorder. Finally, IgE levels should be considered to be used as a marker to evaluate CU patients and
assess disease severity as well as duration, thereby potentially affecting patient management.
