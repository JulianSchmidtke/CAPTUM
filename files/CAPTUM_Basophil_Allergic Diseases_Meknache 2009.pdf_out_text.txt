Human Basophils Express the GlycosylphosphatidylinositolAnchored Low-Affinity IgG Receptor FcyRIIIB (CD16B)'

Nihad Meknache,”** Friederike Jénsson,”*' Jéréme Laurent,* Marie-Thérése Guinnepain,*
and Marc Daéron***

Basophils express not only high-affinity IgE receptors, but also low-affinity IgG receptors. Which, among these receptors, are
expressed by human basophils is poorly known. Low-affinity IgG receptors comprise CD32 (FeyRIIA, FeyRIIB, and FeyRIIC)
and CD16 (FeyRIHIA and FeyRIIB). FeyRIA, FeyRIIC, and FeyRIIIA are activating receptors, FeyRIIB are inhibitory receptors, FeyRIIIB are GPI-anchored receptors whose function is poorly understood. Basophils were reported to express FeyRII,
but not FeyRIII. We aimed at further identifying basophil IgG receptors. Basophils from normal donors and from patients
suffering from an allergic skin disease (atopic dermatitis), allergic respiratory diseases (allergic rhinitis and asthma), or a nonallergic skin disease (chronic urticaria) were examined. We found that normal basophils contain FeyRIII transcripts and express
FeyRUIB, but not FeyRIIA, which were detected on 24-81% basophils from normal donors and on 12-100% basophils from
patients. Noticeably, the proportion of FeyRIIIB* basophils was significantly lower in atopic dermatitis patients than in other
subjects. This decreased FcyRIII expression was not correlated with an activated phenotype of basophils in atopic dermatitis
patients, although FeyRIIIB expression was down-regulated upon basophil activation by anti-IgE. Our results challenge the two
dogmas 1) that basophils do not express FeyRIII and 2) that FeyRIIIB is exclusively expressed by neutrophils. They suggest that
a proportion of basophils may be lost during enrichment procedures in which FeyRIII* cells are discarded by negative sorting
using anti-CD16 Abs. They unravel an unexpected complexity of IgG receptors susceptible to modulate basophil activation. They

identify a novel systemic alteration in atopic dermatitis. The Journal of Immunology, 2009, 182: 2542-2550.

asophils are increasingly recognized as critical cells in
B allergy. Like mast cells, they contain and, upon stimula
tion, they release preformed granular vasoactive amines,
they synthesize lipid-derived mediators, and they secrete high
amounts of Th2 cytokines (1). As a consequence, basophils are
thought to play pivotal roles not only as the effectors of acute
reactions such as anaphylaxis but also, by promoting Th2 polarization, as the inducers of an atopic phenotype (2). Additionally,
basophils were recently shown to promote IgE-dependent chronic
allergic inflammation in mice (3).

Basophils can be activated by numerous extracellular stimuli
which engage cell-activating receptors. Among these are receptors
for the Fe portion of Abs (FcRs). Activating FcRs include IgE and
IgG receptors. Basophils express high-affinity IgE receptors
(FceRI), which are well known as the triggers of IgE-dependent

allergic reactions and anaphylaxis (4). The activating properties of
FceRI depend on the presence of ITAMs in the intracytoplasmic
domains of FeRy and FcR, the two FeR common subunits with
which they constitutively associate (5). Mast cells and basophils
also express low-affinity IgG receptors. Mouse, but not human
mast cells express FeyRIIIA, which also associate with FeRy and
FcR® in these cells. FeyRIIA activate mouse mast cells, both in
vitro (6) and in vivo (7). Whether mouse basophils express
FeyRIIA is not known. Basophils were however recently reported
to account for IgG-induced, but not IgE-induced passive systemic
anaphylaxis in mice, whereas mast cells accounted for IgE-induced, but not IgG-induced anaphylaxis (8). Mouse basophils
therefore express functional activating IgG receptors. Whether a
similar situation applies to humans is not known. Human, but not
mouse, mast cells and basophils express Fe yRIIA/C (9), which do
not associate with FcRy or FcRB, but which contain an ITAM in
their own intracytoplasmic domain. FeyRIIA were shown to activate mast cells in RBL-2H3 transfectants (9) and in human skinderived mast cells (10). Whether they can activate human basophils is not known. Finally, although not formally demonstrated,
human basophils probably also express inhibitory IgG receptors
(FeyRIIB). The coengagement of IgG receptors with IgE receptors
on basophils by allergen-IgG Ab complexes was indeed found to
inhibit IgE-induced histamine release (9, 11), as it had been previously shown in mouse mast cells (12). FeyRs are therefore potential positive and/or negative regulators of basophil activation.
The CD nomenclature is often used to designate human FcRs.
Using this nomenclature, basophils were described to express
CD32, but not CD16 (13-15). CD32 refers to FeyRII whereas
CD16 refers to FeyRIUI. CD32 therefore includes FeyRIIA,
FeyRIIB, and FeyRIIC, i-e., one inhibitory and two activating
receptors. One anti-CD32 mAb specifically recognizes FeyRIIA,
another recognizes FeyRIIB and FeyRIIC, and others, such as

mAb FLI8.26 (16), recognize all three FeyRII subtypes. There is
no commercially available FceyRIIB- or FeyRIIC-specific Ab.
Likewise, CD16 includes two FeyRIII isoforms. FeyRIIA
(CD16A) is an FcRy-associated (17) transmembrane receptor (18)
expressed by monocytes (19), NK cells (20), and NKT cells (21).
FeyRIIB (CD16B) is a GPI-anchored receptor which does not
associate with FeRy and has no intracytoplasmic domain (22).
FeyRIIIB is thought to be exclusively expressed by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (23). Several anti-FeyRIII Abs, such as
mAbs 3G8 (24) and LNK16 (25), recognize both FeyRIIA and
FeyRIIB. No FeyRIIA- or FeyRIIB-specific Ab is available.

Studies on basophils have been hampered by the low number of
these cells in peripheral blood and by the lack of reliable in vitro
models of mature basophils. Various methods of basophil enrichment have therefore been developed using centrifugation (e.g., elutriation) and/or sorting procedures based on the differential expression of membrane molecules by basophils. These enrichment
techniques are not without inconvenience. Basophils may be altered (e.g., activated) by positive selection procedures while some
may be discarded by negative selection procedures. Basophils can
be identified among other blood leukocytes by flow cytometry using CD203c. Differing from other membrane molecules, CD203c
is indeed a specific marker of blood basophils (14, 26). It is constitutively expressed and up-regulated upon basophil activation
(26). CD203c is therefore used as a positive criterion for identifying basophils and its increased expression as an indicator of
basophil activation. Using CD203c as a marker, we undertook an
investigation of FcyRs expressed by human basophils in blood
samples from normal and allergic individuals.

We found that blood basophils express not only FeyRII, as
expected, but also FeyRIII. We demonstrate that basophils detectably express FeyRIIIB, but not FeyRIIA, that FeyRIIIB is
detectably expressed by at least one-fourth of basophils in all
normal donors, and that the percentage of FceyRIIIB * basophils

 

 

 

is significantly lower in atopic dermatitis patients than in normal donors.

Materials and Methods
Subjects

Healthy controls. Blood from normal donors was obtained from the Centre Necker-Cabanel of the Etablissement Frangais du Sang, (Paris, France).
Patients. Peripheral blood was collected, within the frame of disease exploration and with informed consent, from 25 patients who visited the
Allergology Outpatient Clinic of the Centre Médical de |’Institut Pasteur
between May and September 2007. These included five patients with atopic
dermatitis, seven patients with rhinitis, six patients with allergic asthma,
and seven patients with chronic urticaria (Table I). Atopic dermatitis fulfilled the clinical criteria of Hanifin and Rajka (27) and Hanifin (28). Its
severity was assessed by the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis Index (29). Rhinitis
and allergic asthma were classified according to the guidelines of the Allergic Rhinitis and Its Impact on Asthma (30) and of the Global Initiative
for Asthma (31). Chronic urticaria was defined as recurrent episodes of
everyday hives for more than 6 mo with no identified trigger. Three among
chronic urticaria patients had an associated autoimmune thyroiditis. All
patients underwent skin prick tests with common aeroallergens. No patient
received systemic immunosuppressive or corticosteroid treatment. The investigation was approved by the Biomedical Research Committee of the
Institut Pasteur.

anti-FceRI was from eBioscience. FITC-conjugated polyclonal goat antihuman IgE was from Sigma-Aldrich and FITC-conjugated normal polyclonal goat IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories.
Nonlabeled Abs. Polyclonal rabbit anti-human IgE was from DakoCytomation. F(ab’), of rabbit anti-mouse IgG (RAM)* were from Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories. 3G8 F(ab’), were prepared by pepsin digestion of 3G8 IgG Abs purified from hybridoma supernatant by affinity
chromatography on protein G-Sepharose.

Reagents. UltraAvidin-FITC was from Leinco Technologies.

Immunofluorescence

Whole blood cells were depleted of RBCs by hypotonic lysis in buffer
containing 77 mM NH, Cl, 3.6 mM K,COs, and 0.4 mM EDTA and were
washed in cold PBS containing 0.5% BSA (PBS-BSA). Cells were incubated with PE-conjugated, FITC-conjugated, and/or allophycocyanin-conjugated Abs for 15 min at 0°C. Cell fluorescence was analyzed by flow
cytometry in gates (see Fig. 2) using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). For
basophil analysis, a constant number of 1000 CD203c* cells was acquired.

Cell sorting

PBMCs were isolated from whole human blood by Ficoll-Paque density
centrifugation. Basophils were identified using allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-FceRI and PE-conjugated anti-CD203c Abs and separated using
a MoFlo sorter (DakoCytomation). To assess the purity of sorted cells,
cytospins were prepared and cells were colored with Giemsa stain (Fluka).
Images were acquired using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped with a
Zeiss Axiovison HRe camera and Axiovision 4.4 software.

RT-PCR

RT-PCR was performed on cDNA prepared with RNA from sorted human
basophils and, as positive and negative controls, on cDNA from blood
leukocytes and from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells or CHO transfectants expressing human FeyRIIA, FeyRIIB, FeyRIIA, or FeyRIIIB
(32). cDNA was produced using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) either with oligo(dT) or random hexamers. The following primers
were used: FeyRIII forward, 5’-TCAAATGTTTGTCTTCACAG-3’;
FeyRIII reverse, 5'-ATTCACCTGAGGTGTCACAG-3’; tubulin forward,
5'-TGTTCGTAGACCTGGAACCCAC-3'; and tubulin reverse, 5’CTCAACCACAGCAGTGGAAACC-3’.

Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC)
digestion

RBC-depleted blood cells were incubated with 0.5 [U/ml PI-PLC (SigmaAldrich) for 30 min at 37°C. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by washing cells in cold PBS-BSA. Cells were stained with fluorescent Abs and
analyzed by flow cytometry. PI-PLC treatment had no effect on CD203c
expression by basophils.

Basophil activation

Anti-IgE induced. Blood cells were incubated with 10 j1g/ml anti-[gE Abs
for 30 min at 37°C before RBCs were depleted by hypotonic lysis. They

were then stained with anti-CD203c-PE and fluorescence was analyzed by
flow cytometry.

Anti-CD16 induced. RBC-depleted cells were incubated with 10 wg/ml
3G8 F(ab’), for 30 min at 37°C, washed, and incubated with 30 pg/ml
RAM F(ab’), for 30 min at 37°C. Stimulation was stopped by washing
cells in cold PBS-BSA. Cells were stained with PE-conjugated antiCD203¢ Abs and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed with the Statistical Analysis System package for
MacIntosh (SAS Institute). A nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was
used to compare normal donors and patients. Correlations were analyzed
using the Pearson’s correlation coefficient.

Results
Human basophils express FcyRIII

CD203c is a specific marker of human basophils (14, 26). Blood
basophils also express FeeRI, a proportion of which is occupied by
IgE. When analyzed by flow cytometry in RBC-depleted blood
cells previously incubated with PE-conjugated anti-CD203c and
FITC-conjugated anti-IgE Abs, IgE" CD203c* cells were found in
a region having a low side scatter (SSC) and an intermediate forward scatter (FSC) (Fig. 1). As expected, IgE" cells included
CD203c* and CD203c™ cells. Cells other than basophils indeed
express IgE receptors. By contrast, all CD203c* cells were IgE.
CD203c alone is therefore sufficient to identify basophils in normal
blood. The percentage of CD203c”* cells was 0.67 + 0.42% (n =
17) in normal donors.

We first examined the expression of the two classes of lowaffinity IgG receptors, FeyRII and FeyRIII, on basophils and, as
positive and negative controls, on other white blood cells. RBCdepleted blood cells from normal donors were doubly labeled with
PE-conjugated cell-type specific Abs and with FITC-conjugated
anti-FeyRII (mAb FLI8.26) or anti-FeyRIII (mAb 3G8) Abs, and
fluorescence was analyzed in gates shown in Fig. 2A. As expected,
neutrophils, identified by anti-CD24 Abs in gate 1, and monocytes,
identified by anti-CD14 Abs in gate 2, expressed both FeyRII and
FeyRIII. NK cells, identified by anti-CD56 Abs in gate 3, ex
 

pressed FcyRIII, but not FeyRII, whereas B cells, identified by
anti-CD19 Abs in gate 3, expressed FeyRII, but not FeyRII. T
cells, identified by anti-CD3 Abs in gate 3, expressed neither
FeyRI nor FeyRIII, except a minor FeyRIT FeyRII* subpopulation, probably corresponding to NKT cells. As expected, basophils, identified by anti-CD203c Abs in gate 4, expressed
FeyRII. Unexpectedly, basophils also expressed low but detectable
levels of FeyRIII (Fig. 2B). Triple labeling with PE-conjugated
anti-CD203c, allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-FeyRIII, and
FITC-conjugated anti-IgE Abs confirmed that CD203c*IgE* cells
were indeed stained by anti-FeyRIII Abs (Fig. 2C).

In another set of experiments, basophils were identified in normal blood with PE-conjugated anti-CD203c and allophycocyaninconjugated anti-FceRI Abs, instead of anti-IgE Abs, and FeyRIII
expression was assessed with another anti-FeyRIII mAb (biotinylated LNK16 and FITC-conjugated avidin, instead of FITC-conjugated 3G8). The whole CD203c*FceRI* basophil population
was also stained with this anti-FeyRIII Ab (Fig. 2D).

To further confirm this finding, normal blood cells stained with
PE-conjugated anti-CD203c and allophycocyanin-conjugated antiFceRI Abs were sorted with a FACSorter (BD Biosciences). The
sorted population contained >90% CD203c*FceRI* cells (Fig.
3A). When stained with Giemsa, sorted cells appeared as a homogenous population of granulated cells with a typical basophil

morphology (Fig. 3B). They were stained with anti-FeyRHI mAb
(Fig. 3C). They contained FeyRIII transcripts as shown by RTPCR analysis with FeyRIII-specific primers (Fig. 3D).

These data altogether demonstrate that basophils from normal
donors express not only FceRI and FeyRII, but also FeyRIII.

Human basophils express FcyRIIB

FeyRIIA and FeyRIIB can be distinguished by their differential
sensitivity to PI-PLC. GPI-anchored FeyRIJIB, but not transmembrane FeyRIIA, are indeed cleaved by PI-PLC (33, 34). To determine which isoform(s) of FeyRIII is(are) expressed by basophils, RBC-depleted blood cells were therefore treated or not
treated with PI-PLC and doubly labeled with PE-conjugated celltype specific Abs and with FITC-conjugated anti-FeyRIII or antiFeyRII Abs. PI-PLC treatment decreased the anti-FeyRIII staining
not only of cp24* neutrophils, as expected, but also of CD203c .
basophils (Fig. 4A). Noticeably, the mean fluorescence intensity
(MFI) of anti-FeyRIII staining was comparably reduced (4-fold) in
both cell types, and it was virtually abrogated in basophils. By
contrast, PI-PLC treatment affected neither the anti-FeyRIII staining of CD14* monocytes and CD56" NK cells (Fig. 3A), which
express FeyRIIA but not FeyRIIIB, nor the anti-FeyRII staining
of CD203c* basophils, CD24* neutrophils, and CD14* monocytes (Fig. 4B). Basophils from normal donors therefore express
FeyRIIB but not FeyRIIIA.

FeyRIIB lack intracytoplasmic domain and do not associate
with FcR y. Whether they can trigger activation signals is unclear.
To determine whether the engagement of Fe yRIIIB could activate
basophils, CD203c expression was monitored on RBC-depleted
blood cells stimulated with F(ab’), of anti-FeyRII Abs and
F(ab’), of RAM Abs. As positive controls, cells were also stimulated with rabbit anti-human IgE Abs. Whereas FceRI aggregation
by anti-IgE markedly up-regulated CD203c expression, no or little
CD203c up-regulation was seen following FcyRIII aggregation
(Fig. 4C). The engagement of FcyRIII therefore does not activate
basophils or poorly, when assessed by CD203c up-regulation. This
observation supports the conclusion that basophils express
FeyRIIB, but not FeyRIIA.

To determine whether FeyRIJIB expression by normal basophils
is arule or an exception, RBC-depleted blood cells from 23 normal
donors were doubly labeled with anti-CD203c and anti-FeyRII
Abs. Due to the low expression of FeyRIIIB by basophils, the

dT hex dT hex dT dT dT dT dT

fluorescence of cells labeled with anti-FeyRIII Abs partially overlaps with the fluorescence of cells labeled with isotype controls. To
compare individual donors and to take into account individual
background variations, FeyRIII expression by basophils was expressed as the percentage of CD203c* blood cells stained with
anti-FeyRIII Abs over the background staining with isotype controls (referred to as FeyRIII* basophils) on cells from the same
donor. Using this criterion, only a fraction of basophils are identified as FeyRUI. This does not imply that FeyRIII is expressed
by a subpopulation of basophils only. As expected, the percentage
of FeyRIII* basophils varied from donor to donor. Between 24
and 81% basophils (median, 44%) were FeyRIII* in the population studied. Noticeably, FeyRIII* basophils were seen in all 23
normal donors tested (Fig. 5A). FeyRIIIB is therefore detectably
expressed by at least one-fourth of blood basophils in normal
individuals.

FcyRIIB expression is decreased on basophils from atopic
dermatitis patients

We next compared FeyRIIIB expression on basophils from normal
donors and from 25 patients with diseases commonly seen in allergy practice. These were 5 patients with an allergic skin disease
(atopic dermatitis), 13 patients with allergic respiratory diseases
(rhinitis and asthma), and 7 patients with a nonallergic skin disease
(chronic urticaria) (Table I). As in normal subjects, FeyRIII* basophils were detected in all 25 patients. The proportion of
FeyRIII* basophils, however, varied more widely in patients than
in normal donors (from 12 to 100%). It did not differ statistically
from normal donors in respiratory allergy patients (median, 57%)
and in chronic urticaria patients (median, 34%), but it was significantly lower (p = 0.0142) in atopic dermatitis patients (median,
22%) (Fig. 5A). Four of the five atopic dermatitis patients were
females. The percentage of FceyRIII* basophils was however not
significantly lower in female than in male patients (Fig. 5B). On
average, dermatitis patients were younger than other patients. The
percentage of FeyRIII* basophils was however not correlated with
the age of the patients (Fig. 5C).

Cell activation having been reported to decrease the expression
of Fe yRIIIB by neutrophils (35), we investigated whether basophil
activation might account for the decreased FeyRIIIB expression
seen in atopic dermatitis patients. FeyRIIIB and CD203c expression were examined first on basophils from eight normal donors

HUMAN BASOPHILS EXPRESS FeyRIIIB (CD16B)

The MFI of anti-CD203c staining was not significantly different in
atopic dermatitis patients, compared with normal donors (Fig. 6B).

A hallmark of atopic dermatitis is a high serum IgE level and,
indeed, the serum concentration of IgE was markedly higher in
atopic dermatitis patients (median, 4273 IU/ml) than in allergic
respiratory disease patients (median, 147 TU/ml) and in chronic
urticaria patients (median, 126 IU/ml; Table I). IgE concentration
was correlated neither with the gender (Fig. 7A) nor with the age
of the patients (Fig. 7B). The percentage of FeyRIII* basophils
was not correlated with serum IgE levels either (Fig. 7C).

Discussion

Results reported here challenge two widely accepted notions. First,
human basophils are considered as CD16-negative cells (13-15).
We show here that blood basophils detectably expressed FeyRIII
in all donors, whether normal individuals or patients. Second, the
GPI-anchored FeyRIIIB is considered to be solely expressed by
human neutrophils (23). We show that FcyRIIIB is also expressed
by basophils. Interestingly, we also show that the percentage of
FeyRIIIB-expressing basophils is lower in atopic dermatitis patients than in normal donors. These findings may have practical,
fundamental, and clinical implications.

FeyRIII are typically expressed by blood neutrophils, monocytes, NK, and NKT cells, but not by B cells, T cells, and basophils. We found that at least 24% and up to 81% basophils from
normal donors and at least 12% and up to 100% basophils from
allergic (and nonallergic) patients were detectably labeled by antiFeyRIII Abs. FeyRIII were detected by direct and indirect immunofluorescence, using two anti-FeyRIII mAbs, on basophils identified in blood from normal donors as CD203c'IgE* or as
CD203c*FeeRI* cells and on CD203c*FceRI* sorted cells that
had a typical basophil morphology. Although 92% sorted cells
only were doubly labeled with anti-CD203c and anti-FceRI Abs,
all had a basophil morphology when stained with Giemsa. A likely
explanation is that altered cells or debris accounted for the 8%
unlabeled cells. FeyRIII sequences were amplified by RT-PCR in
cDNA transcribed from RNA extracted from sorted basophils. The
primers used were FcyRIII specific as they amplified sequences in
cDNA from CHO transfectants expressing FeyRIIA or FeyRIIIB,
but not from transfectants expressing FeyRIA or FeyRIIB.
FcyRIII sequences were amplified both in cDNA transcribed from
total RNA and in cDNA transcribed from poly(A) RNA extracted
from sorted basophils.

Several reasons may explain why FeyRIII was not previously
observed on basophils. One is that studies in which basophils were
first phenotyped were done at a time when human FeyR isoforms
had not yet been all identified and with mAbs whose specificity for
FeyR subtypes was unclear (36-38). Another reason is the much
lower expression of FcRIII by basophils than by other FeyRIII*
blood cells. MFI values of anti-FcyRIII staining were indeed 10to 100-fold lower for basophils than for monocytes, NK cells, or
neutrophils. Techniques with a relatively low sensitivity, which
would be sufficient to brightly label these cells, may not or hardly
label basophils. One may have interpreted a weak basophil labeling as background labeling and have neglected it. Finally, FeyRIII
may not have been seen in negatively sorted basophil preparations
because FeyRIII* basophils were discarded. Basophil enrichment
techniques use magnetic beads and a mixture of mAbs against
membrane molecules that are not expressed by basophils. As basophils were described to express CD13, CD22, CD32, CD33,
CD123 and CD203c, but not CD2, CD3, CD14, CD15, CD16,
CD19, CD21, CD64, and HLA-DR (13-15), negative selection
procedures used to enrich basophils from white blood cells include

The Journal of Immunology

anti-CD16, i.e., anti-FeyRII (13, 39), among other mAbs. Although FceyRIII expression is low on basophils, one cannot exclude
that enrichment procedures in which CD16" cells are discarded
may remove a significant proportion of basophils. This would introduce a bias in sorted basophils. It may also decrease the yield of
these techniques.

No mAb is available that discriminates FeyRIIA from
FeyRIIB. On the basis of the differential sensitivity of FeyRIIIA
and FeyRIIIB to PI-PLC, we however found that basophils express
the GPI-anchored FeyRIIIB but, apparently, not the transmembrane FcRy-associated FeyRIIIA. PI-PLC treatment of blood cells
indeed reduced similarly the staining of basophils and neutrophils,
but not of monocytes or NK cells, by anti-FeyRII, and had no
detectable effect on the staining of any blood cells, including basophils, by anti-FeyRII. The anti-FeyRIII staining of basophils
was reduced below the background level in PI-PLC-treated cells,
suggesting that basophils do not express FeyRIIIA. The expression
of FeyRIIIB is therefore not restricted to neutrophils, as previously
thought. Noticeably, intracellular FeyRIIIB was reported, in one
article (40), in normal eosinophils, suggesting the possibility that
all three types of polymorphonuclear granulocytes may express the
Fegr3b gene.

The biological functions of FeyRIIIB are poorly understood.
When expressed in transfectants and aggregated by appropriate
plurivalent ligands, FeyRIIB did not trigger activation signals
(41). FeyRIIB aggregation was, however, reported to trigger the
production of H,O, and an increased intracellular Ca** concentration in neutrophils (42). Neutrophil FeyRIIIB were also found to
trigger degranulation (43) and to activate Tec (44) and Syk (45)
protein tyrosine kinases. We failed to induce a significant CD203c
up-regulation when aggregating Fc yRIIIB on basophils under similar conditions. CD203c up-regulation is associated with exocytosis (26). Whether the engagement of FeyRIIIB can induce responses of basophils other than degranulation, e.g., cytokine
synthesis/secretion, remains to be investigated. In any case, our
finding that basophils do not degranulate in response to FeyRII
engagement supports the conclusion that basophils do not express
FeyRIIA.

Like other GPI-anchored molecules, FeyRIIIB constitutively resides in cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich plasma membrane microdomains or lipid rafts (45, 46). Signaling molecules, including
Sre family protein tyrosine kinases (47) and the transmembrane
adapter LAT (48), are also located in lipid rafts, and the aggregation of lipid raft-associated gangliosides was reported to trigger
activation signals (49). Besides, FeyRIIIB has been proposed to
synergize with activating FcRs (43) by facilitating the binding of
IgG immune complexes to other FeyRs on the same cell (45, 50).
Alternatively, FeyRUIB could compete with other FeyRs for immune complex binding. Whether FeyRIIIB may enhance or decrease cell signaling by other basophil FeyRs needs to be determined. The expression of several low-affinity IgG receptors with
different signaling properties may indeed explain why no clear-cut
conclusion was drawn regarding the ability of IgG immune complexes to activate basophils (51).

Interestingly, the percentage of FeyRIIIB* basophils was significantly lower in atopic dermatitis patients than in normal donors,
but not in chronic urticaria patients, in allergic rhinitis patients, or
in allergic asthma patients. A decreased expression of FeyRIIIB by
basophils was therefore observed in an allergic skin disease, but
neither in a non-allergic inflammatory skin disease nor in two allergic respiratory diseases. Noticeably, FeyRIIIB expression was
not decreased on neutrophils from atopic dermatitis patients (data
not shown), suggesting that FeyRIIIB down-regulation selectively
affects basophils. The expression of FeyRIIIB was previously re
 

 

2549

ported to be down-regulated on activated neutrophils (35) and
FeyRIIB down-regulation was proposed to result from the cleavage of the receptor by proteases released and/or activated during
neutrophil activation (52). We found that the expression of
FeyRIIB was also down-regulated on activated basophils, and
similar mechanisms may operate in the two cell types. Basophils
may indeed release and/or activate proteases when activated. Although mast cell proteases are well characterized and used as mast
cell type-specific markers (53), basophil proteases are poorly
known. Murine basophils were however described to express
mMCP-8. This protease is related to T cell granzymes and to the
neutrophil cathepsin G, rather than to mast cell tryptases or chymases (54). Fe yRIIIB down-regulation was however not correlated
with CD203c up-regulation on basophils from atopic dermatitis
patients, suggesting that it was not associated with a possible
chronic basophil activation. The percentages of FeyRIIIB* basophils were not correlated either with serum IgE levels which
were markedly elevated in atopic dermatitis patients.
IgE-bearing APCs, T cells, mast cells, eosinophils, and keratinocytes concur to generate atopic dermatitis lesions (55). Interestingly, basophils were observed in skin biopsies after allergen challenge and in skin lesions from atopic dermatitis patients (56). The
biological significance of the decreased frequency of FeyRIII*
basophils in atopic dermatitis patients is not known. Whether it is
a cause or a consequence in this disease and whether it has pathological consequences need to be investigated. It nevertheless supports the idea that, although a skin disease, atopic dermatitis is a
systemic disease rather than a disease of the skin.
