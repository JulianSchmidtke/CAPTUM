Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is considered to be
primarily a mast cell-driven disease. However, recent evidence
suggests that eosinophils may also have an axial role in
symptomology. Histologic studies have demonstrated the
presence of both eosinophils and eosinophil granules, indicative
of activation, in CSU lesions. Although many allergic and
inflammatory conditions are associated with a peripheral blood
eosinophilia, the converse appears to be the case in CSU, with a
peripheral blood eosinopenia being observed in many patients.
Possible mechanisms include the depletion of blood eosinophils
by recruitment into the skin during active disease and
immunologic destruction in the blood. We also address in some
detail the interactions between eosinophils and mast cells,
particularly the cytokine cross-talk of these cells and mediator
release possibly leading to clinical symptoms. Also, activation by
eosinophil proteins of the coagulation pathway leads to the
generation of thrombin and increased mast cell degranulation.
Finally, treatments aimed at reducing eosinophil accumulation

and activation, such as the anti-IL-5 antibodies mepolizumab,
reslizumab, and benralizumab, have been reported to reduce
CSU symptoms. Clearly, a new picture of an important role of
eosinophils in the pathogenesis of CSU is emerging. (J Allergy
Clin Immunol 2020;145:1510-6.)

Key words: Urticaria chronic spontaneous urticaria, mast cell,
eosinophil

Eosinophils and mast cells, both cells of the innate immune
system, have bidirectional communication pathways and important synergistic immunologic functions.’ In parasitic infections,
the mast cell and the eosinophil act in tandem to eliminate the
parasite. The initial response is IgE-dependent activation of
mast cells to induce vasodilatation, itching, and mucus secretion
in mucous membranes. In addition, mast cell cytokines stimulate
a Ty2 inflammation,” resulting in the recruitment of eosinophils.** The role of the eosinophil, which is essentially a secondary effector cell, is to kill parasitic worms, particularly in larval
stages, by secretion of their cytotoxic proteins, major basic protein (MBP), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and the less toxic
eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN ta

Allergy (of the immediate type) can essentially be considered
an inappropriate parasite-killing response whereby the immune
system recognizes common allergens, such as grass and tree
pollens, house dust mites, and peanuts as though they are
parasites.’ Again, IgE-dependent mast cell activation is the
primary stimulus. In allergic rhinitis, for example, mast cell
histamine causes vasodilatation, rhinorrhea, itching, and
sneezing. The release of mast cell cytokines stimulates a Ty2
response with the influx of eosinophils whose cytotoxic proteins
cause sustained allergic inflammation and exacerbate nasal
congestion.°”

Now let us consider chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), a
mast cell—driven skin disease characterized by the recurrence of
transient wheals, angioedema, or both for more than 6 weeks.*
Mast cell degranulation induced via the high-affinity IgE receptor
(FceRI) is considered one of the most frequent initiating factors in
CSU. This is evidenced by the effectiveness of omalizumab
(anti-IgE) in reducing the symptoms of the disease.'° In CSU,
FceRI-dependent mast cell degranulation may occur in either of
2 ways, as shown in Fig |. The first is type 1 autoallergy, in which
a patient’s IgE is directed to autoallergens, such as thyroid peroxidase'' and IL-24.'>'* The second is type 2 autoimmunity, in
which IgG-autoantibodies to IgE or FceRI initiate mast cell activation.'"!” Mast cell cytokines could initiate a local late-phase
response that would be expected to result in eosinophil infiltration
and activation, as in the response to parasites and allergy.

THE BIOLOGY AND FUNCTION OF EOSINOPHILS

Eosinophils are circulating innate immune cells representing
1% to 3 % of the white blood cells. They originate from
multipotent hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow.'°
When eosinophils are terminally differentiated, the presence of
IL-5 is crucial for entering the blood stream,'”'* where they
persist in the circulation for 8 to 12 hours without proliferation.
Chemokines, especially eotaxin-1 (CCLI1), eotaxin-2
(CCL24), monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP3), and
RANTES, which bind to the 8-chemokine receptor CCR3 on eosinophils, have been shown to be responsible for eosinophil
recruitment to sites of allergic inflammation in the airways, '”°°
skin, and other tissues. Once migrated to tissues, eosinophils
are able to survive for additional 8 to 12 days in the absence of
stimulation.”'

Besides contributing to (immune) homeostasis, eosinophils are
commonly known for their role as effector cells in allergies
(especially in asthma and allergic rhinitis), fueling chronic
inflammation and tissue destruction. Together with mast cells,
they represent the key effector cells in allergic inflammation, thus
being termed the allergic effector unit.° Furthermore, they
contribute to autoimmune disorders (eg, bullous pemphigoid, inflammatory bowel disease, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic myocarditis, neuromyelitis optica, primary
biliary cirrhosis),”> cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.”! In patients with CSU, eosinophils are abundant along with mast cells
at sites of skin lesions, and they are also present in nonlesional
skin.”

Here, we review the evidence that supports a contribution of
eosinophils to the pathogenesis of CSU, their role as a biomarker,
and their value as a target of treatment of patients with CSU.

WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE FOR EOSINOPHIL
INVOLVEMENT IN CSU?

The presence of eosinophil infiltration in urticarial skin lesions
of patients with CSU was demonstrated as early as in the 1980s by
Grattan et al in patients with CSU who were injected with
autologous sera.”° Subsequent studies have confirmed eosinophil
infiltration in CSU lesions,’ together with lymphocytes,* and
small numbers of other cells, such as neutrophils and basophils.°°*"*? Interestingly, eosinophils and microvascular changes
persist in uninvolved skin, which together with increased mast
cell numbers, suggests that nonlesional skin is primed for further
whealing.”” Furthermore, reports of mononuclear cell and

 

ALTRICHTER ET AL 1511

eosinophil perivascular infiltration into the areas of wheals have
also been reported in some forms of chronic inducible urticaria
(eg, delayed pressure urticaria and solar urticaria).*°****

Immunocytochemical studies using eosinophil granular
proteins, particularly MBP, have explored eosinophil degranulation in chronic urticaria. In an initial study, Peters et al”
demonstrated the occurrence of eosinophil degranulation in
lesional biopsy specimens from 12 of 28 patients with
chronic urticaria. Subsequent studies have reported large
numbers of extracellular eosinophil granules in the vicinity
of disrupted eosinophils in long-duration wheals (defined
as lasting >24 hours) compared with in  short-duration
wheals.”’*°

HOW ARE EOSINOPHILS RECRUITED INTO THE
SKIN?

Recruitment of eosinophils to sites of allergic inflammation in
the skin and other tissues is driven by IL-5, which is essential
for the expansion and mobilization of eosinophils from the bone
marrow,’! as well as by chemotactic chemokines, especially
eotaxin-1 and eotaxin-2, MCP3, and RANTES. These chemokines bind to the B-chemokine receptor CCR3 on eosinophils,
which drives the eosinophil recruitment to sites of allergic
inflammation in the airways.’ There are essentially 2 critical
steps involved in eosinophil recruitment, beginning with eosinophil adhesion to endothelial cells with the aid of the adhesion
molecules 81 integrin and £2 integrin, as well as selectins expressed’” on the surface of endothelial cells. After the process
of adhesion is complete, migration of eosinophils into tissues
takes place under the influence of the aforementioned chemotactic factors** (Fig 1).

Recruitment of eosinophils to sites of allergic inflammation
usually involves IL-5—producing Ty2 cells,** as well as tissue—
resident type 2 innate lymphoid cells constitutively expressing
IL-5 and thereby supporting their homeostasis under steadystate conditions.” As these cells have not as yet been
described as being pathophysiologically involved in CSU, their
role in eosinophil recruitment in CSU remains elusive. Other
cells that are capable of eosinophil recruitment are dermal fibroblasts, which have been identified as an important source
of eotaxin on stimulation with TNF-a and IL-4."° In addition,
basophils are involved in eosinophil recruitment, as shown in a
model of IgE-dependent skin inflammation in which IgE—
activated basophils produced IL-4 on interaction with endothelial cells. In turn, IL-4 promotes the upregulation of vascular
cell adhesion molecule | on the vascular endothelium, which
is necessary for eosinophil entry.*’ Interestingly, dupilumab,
a mAb against IL-4 and IL-13 receptors, was effective in
CSU in an early study.** Additionally, IgE-activated basophils
expressing FceRI have been demonstrated to play an active
role in eosinophil recruitment through the secretion of IL-4/
IL-13, which leads to STAT6-dependent expression of
CCL24 from endothelial cells and extravasation of eosinophils
into the tissues.“

Mast cells are a source of various mediators. They have been
shown to release IL-5 and eotaxins and could thereby directly
mobilize and recruit eosinophils into the skin”? Furthermore,
they can stimulate dermal fibroblasts via TNF-a! or activate
and recruit basophils via IL-3,’ and they could thereby also
be indirectly involved in eosinophil recruitment. In CSU, these

mechanisms have not been proved as of yet, but they seem
feasible.

ARE HIGHER SKIN NUMBERS OF EOSINOPHILS
LINKED TO HIGHER EOSINOPHIL COUNTS IN THE
BLOOD OF PATIENTS WITH CSU?

In many diseases such as allergic, infectious, inflammatory, and
neoplastic disorders, tissue eosinophilia had been associated with
peripheral blood eosinophilia (2450-550 eosinophils per pL).
In CSU, however, the converse appears to be the case. Eosinopenia (ie, low absolute eosinophil counts in the blood) was first
described in an individual patient with CSU in 1981.°° In the
ensuing years, eosinopenia has been reported in further individual
case reports of patients presenting with urticaria.”°’’* Recently,
we identified eosinopenia to be present in about 10% of patients
with CSU (n = 129 in a cohort of 1259 patients with CSU).
For the definition of eosinopenia/low blood eosinophil counts,
we used a cutoff of less than 0.05 X 10°/L (50 eosinophils per
wL) because it was frequently used in the literature.°°! The
rate of eosinopenia was considerably higher in comparison with
that in the general population, in which when the same cutoff of
50 eosinophils per L was used, eosinopenia was found to be present in about 5% of the general population in the United Kingdom
(44,112 of 775,231 individuals).°! In our population, 3% of patients with CSU had a complete absence of eosinophils in the
blood and 81% patients with eosinopenia also had basopenia,””
which is a well-known clinical feature of high disease activity
and serum autoreactivity.°”

 

HOW DOES EOSINOPENIA DEVELOP IN CSU?
Currently, the mechanisms leading to eosinopenia in CSU are
unknown. There are, however, several hypothetical mechanisms
that have been described.
First, blood eosinophils may be depleted from the blood by
being recruited to the skin during active disease. This is

supported by findings of significantly higher numbers of
eosinophils and basophils in lesional than in nonlesional skin
of patients with CSU and significantly more eosinophils in
nonlesional skin from patients with CSU than in nonlesional
skin from healthy control subjects.°°°’"°"!'°? Fujisawa et al
also observed eosinophil infiltration in urticarial lesions in 7
of 9 severely affected Patients with CSU but not in the skin
from normal subjects.”

Second, eosinophils may be immunologically destroyed in the
blood of patients with CSU. This hypothesis is supported by the
fact that some patients with CSU can have low eosinophil levels in
both blood and skin. For example, in a 71-year-old woman with
chronic urticaria and vitiligo, a lack of eosinophils, basophils, and
IgE was seen in her blood, bone-marrow, and skin.* This phenomenon may be explained by autoimmune antieosinophil and/
or antibasophil serum activity. In another patient with CSU, complete eosinopenia and basopenia were detected along with IgE
and IgG, anti-IgA antibodies, circulating immune complexes,
and IgA deficiency.’’ Interestingly, a complement-dependent
IgG-related activity was observed in the serum of a patient with
urticaria and complete eosinopenia. This patient’s serum cytotoxically degranulated human eosinophils in vitro without
affecting neutrophils. How common this is is currently unclear,
and further studies are needed to confirm this observation and
characterize the prevalence and relevance of eosinophilactivating serum factors in CSU. In in vivo experiments, the
same serum was able to suppress eosinophil counts in monkeys
for up to 12 hours.*° In another study, all eosinophils and basophils of patients with atopic dermatitis and healthy subjects
were degranulated and then destroyed after their blood was mixed
with the plasma from a patient with eosinopenia, basopenia, alopecia, hemolytic anemia, IgA deficiency, and a very low total IgE
level.°°

Third, it is known that immunosuppressive therapy (eg,
corticosteroids and cyclosporine) can lead to eosinophil depletion.°° In some cases of CSU, a complete blood count may have
been performed during or shortly after such treatment with

 

 
J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL
VOLUME 145, NUMBER 6

immunosuppressive drugs, resulting in an iatrogenically induced
low cell number.

Finally, eosinopenia may be associated not with CSU but with
comorbid diseases described in CSU. For example, IgA deficiency, which has been described in some patients with CSU, has
also been associated with eosinopenia.”*°’

MAST CELL-EOSINOPHIL INTERACTIONS

Eosinophils are able to establish physical contact with mast
cells via its surface receptors sialic acid—binding
immunoglobulin-like lectin 7 and sialic acid—binding
immunoglobulin-like lectin 8 (Siglec-7 and Siglec-8),°°”
CD300a, CD48, CD244/2B4, or Nectin2/CD112.”° Additionally,
eosinophils express a variety of surface receptors to bind secreted
mediators (ie, protease-activated receptor 2 [PAR2], ST2, chemokine receptor homologous molecule expressed on Ty 2 [CRTH2],
TNF-aR, IL-5R, GM-CSF-R, IL-4R, CCRR3, histamine receptors [H1-H4], and sphingosine-1-phosphate [S1P] receptors).”°
Thus, various mediators released by mast cells or through an
interaction of mast cells with other cells (eg, eotaxin, IL-5,
GM-CSF, histamine, PGD2, and platelet-activating factor
[PAF]) can lead to eosinophil recruitment into the skin.°° Consequently, activation of infiltrating eosinophils by, for example, IL5, GM-CSF, or PAF may provoke the persistent activation of mast
cells by secreted eosinophil granule proteins such as major basic
protein-1 (MBP1) and major basic protein-2 (MBP2), eosinophil
peroxidase (EPO), the ribonuclease A superfamily members ECP
and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, and the acidic CharcotLeyden crystal protein (CLC [or galectin-10]). Because of their
biochemical properties, these hydrophobic and cationic proteins
are not only highly toxic to parasites and bacteria, but they can
also activate neutrophils and platelets, and they stimulate histamine release from basophils and mast cells.°°7!? In addition,
eosinophil granule proteins are able to persist in the skin for up
to several weeks. In Hartley guinea pigs, skin-injected ECP,
EDN, and EPO persisted for 1 to 2 weeks, whereas MBP was still
detectable after 6 weeks. * This could maintain the persistent state
of inflammation in long-duration wheals (the late-phase reaction).
For example, activation of the low-affinity IgE receptor FceRII/
CD23 on eosinophils by IgG—anti-FceRII/CD23 leads to secretion of MBP by eosinophils, with consequent histamine release
from basophils.”' Alternatively, activation of the coagulation
cascade by tissue factor produced by eosinophils may lead to generation of thrombin.” Thrombin can induce mast cell degranulation”® via action on PARs and may activate C5, generating C5a.”’
C5a may be responsible for the augmented histamine release after
crosslinking of IgE receptor by IgG—anti-FceRI (autoimmunity
type IIb). Specific IgE against tissue factor,’* IL-24,'* and other
autoallergens can mediate the release of mediators by peripheral
basophils and/or mast cells (autoimmunity type I). Finally, MBP
and EPO can induce degranulation of human skin mast cells
through nonimmunologic activation of MAS-related G protein—
coupled receptor X2 (MRGPRX2).”*

EOSINOPHIL FUNCTION AND CHRONIC URTICARIA

Cellular activation of eosinophils occurs during inflammatory
responses and is mainly mediated by GM-CSF, IL-5, IL-3, and IL13, leading to degranulation and consequent mediator production.

degranulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of urticaria by
activation of skin mast cells.** Additionally, it has been observed
that patients with CSU have increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a very potent regulator of angiogenesis
as well as a major mediator in vascular permeability. VEGF was
found to colocalize with ECP, supporting eosinophils being the
main cellular source of VEGF in chronic urticaria lesional skin.””

Eosinophils may enhance chronic urticaria in 3 ways (Fig 2).
First, eosinophil-derived stem cell factor promotes the recruitment and local maturation of mast cells in the tissues.”*""°""! Second, eosinophil proteins, such as MBP, ECP, and EPO, can
provoke mast cell degranulation.°"'’"***° Third, activated eosinophils also express tissue factor, the main initiator of the coagulation cascade leading to thrombin formation." 8* Thrombin in
turn, as demonstrated in experimental models, may directly activate mast cells by interaction with the PARs PARI and PAR2.*”
Not only may eosinophil infiltration contribute to tissue edema
of lesional skin in CSU,”°?’"°*? but the increased persistence
of eosinophils in nonlesional skin and the deposition of their
granule proteins, together with increased mast cells, could prime
the skin for further whealing.”>

  

WHAT IS THE CLINICAL RELEVANCE OF
EOSINOPENIA IN CSU?

The clinical relevance of eosinopenia in CSU is, as yet, unclear.
However, correlation of eosinopenia with clinical parameters in
patients with CSU has revealed that eosinopenia is linked to
higher disease activity and a poor response to treatment.”
Furthermore, overall lower blood eosinophil numbers were identified in patients with evidence of type IIb autoimmune CSU (eg,
patients with CSU with a positive autologous serum skin test
result, a positive basophil histamine release assay result, or high
levels of IgG—anti-thyroid peroxidase). Most importantly, eosinopenia in CSU was significantly associated with a failure to
respond to the guideline-recommended treatment with both
1514 ALTRICHTER ET AL

second-generation antihistamines and omalizumab. Here, the
combination of eosinopenia and basopenia better predicted
nonresponse to second-generation antihistamines than did eosinopenia alone (odds ratio of 9.5 vs 4.8).

EOSINOPHIL-TARGETED TREATMENT CAN
BENEFIT PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC URTICARIA
INCLUDING CSU

Mast cell-targeted therapies, such as H,-antihistamines and
anti-IgE (omalizumab), in the treatment of CSU are now well established.*'°°°"! But can eosinophil-targeted treatments be of
benefit? The first indication that they could was seen in our clinic
in Berlin in 2017 when a woman with severe asthma was prescribed mepolizumab, a humanized mAb directed against IL5.” In addition to her asthma, this patient had longstanding and
recalcitrant CSU. From the day after initiation of treatment with
mepolizumab, the patient noted a dramatic and sustained
improvement of her urticarial symptoms.”* By 4 weeks, her urticaria was well controlled, and by 8 weeks she was symptom-free.
Following discontinuation of mepolizumab, the signs and symptoms of CSU recurred, indicating that mepolizumab controlled
symptoms rather than curing the condition. Later the same year,
another woman with CSU, cold urticaria, and severe nonallergic
refractory eosinophilic asthma was treated with an anti-IL-5 antibody. This time, the antibody was reslizumab.”' Immediately
following reslizumab injection her symptoms of severe CSU
and cold urticaria improved; she was completely symptom-free
and remained so for the duration of reslizumab treatment. The
third patient was an 80-year-old man with severe uncontrolled
eosinophilic asthma for which treatment was initiated with subcutaneous benralizumab, an anti-IL-5 receptor antibody.” He also
had symptomatic dermographism, which was controlled only
with oral prednisolone. His dermographism was markedly
improved after the first injection of benralizumab; the results of
provocation tests for dermographism were negative by 3
months. °

Although the patients in the aforementioned studies ha
concomitant asthma with systemic eosinophilia, the question of
whether anti-IL-5 therapy would be of benefit in all patients with
urticaria arises. To examine this issue, benralizumab an
mepolizumab are currently under evaluation in CSU (in clinical
trials with the identifiers NCT03183024 and NCT03494881,
respectively).

Another eosinophil-targeted drug, antolimab, a humanize:
mAb to Siglec-8, is being evaluated in a phase Ila, open-label
pilot study (NCT03436797) in patients with CSU, cholinergic
urticaria, and symptomatic dermographism. Antolimab inhibits
mast cell activity and depletes eosinophils by targeting Siglec8, an inhibitory receptor and member of the CD33-relate
family that is expressed on mast cells, eosinophils, an
basophils.””

 

UNANSWERED QUESTIONS, STUDIES THAT
SHOULD BE DONE, CONCLUSIONS

Taken together, the data that we have presented are strong
circumstantial evidence that eosinophils contribute to the pathogenesis of CSU, at least in a subgroup of patients.

Eosinopenia is seen in a subpopulation of patients with CSU,
and its rates are likely to be higher than in the general population.

J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL

In CSU, eosinopenia is linked to high disease activity, type IIb

autoimmunity, and poor response to treatment.
Many questions remain to be answered. These include, but are

not limited to How are eosinophils activated in CSU? How are
eosinophils recruited to sites of whealing? Are eosinophils also
recruited to sites of angioedema? Do eosinophils contribute to
mast cell activation? and Does the involvement of eosinophils
make a difference to the course of the disease, the clinical
features, and the response to treatment?

Further studies are needed to address these and other questions,
which may help to advance our understanding of CSU and

improve its treatment.
