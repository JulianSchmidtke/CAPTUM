Abstract: Chronic urticaria (CU) is a mast cell-driven disease characterized by the development
of wheals, angioedema, or both for more than 6 weeks. The two major sub-types are chronic
spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and inducible urticaria. In the last decade different pathophysiological
mechanisms, potentially responsible for the development of the disease, have been described. It is
likely that the activation of mast cells and basophils in CSU can be the results of immune system
dysregulation, activation of the inflammatory cascade, and of the extrinsic coagulation pathway.
Some of the mediators involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms of CSU have recently been
identified as potential biomarkers useful for the diagnosis, follow-up, and management of the
disease, even if they are not yet available in clinical practice. Thus, in this review we discuss new
insights in the mediators involved in the pathogenesis of CSU, highlighting their potential role as
biomarkers in the activity and progression of the disease and response to therapies.

Keywords: chronic urticaria, inflammation, biomarkers, angiogenesis

 

Introduction

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common disease impacting negatively on multiple
aspects of patients’ lives and its management is often problematic for both the
doctor and the patient. According to the recent guidelines, CU is defined as a
disease characterized by the development of recurrent itchy wheals and/or angioedema occurring for more than 6 weeks, and it is divided into two major sub-types:
chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and inducible urticaria.

In the last decade, the research has focused on defining the mechanisms underlying
the development of CSU, identifying those mediators potentially useful as biomarkers
for determining the severity and predicting the evolution of the disease and response to
therapies. Skin mast cells are the main effector cells in the pathogenesis of CSU, but the
underlying causes of their activation are largely unknown.” Autoimmunity seems to be
involved in the pathogenesis of CSU, following the detection in a sizable subgroup of
patients of circulating IgG autoantibodies directed to thyroid antigens and/or to IgE or
to their high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI).** However, the observation that in a large
part of CSU autoantibodies are not detectable suggests that other mechanisms are
probably involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, thus opening the way to the
identification of biomarkers beyond autoantibodies.”

Immunological Biomarkers
It is well known that mast cells are the main effector cells in the pathogenesis of

urticaria trough the release of their pre-formed and newly synthesized mediators.”°

Although the triggers of mast cells activation in CSU are
largely unknown and remain to be identified, several studies
have allowed to identify in subgroups of CSU patients IgG
autoantibodies directed to thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and/or
to IgE or to their high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI).”*
Evidences of the role of autoimmunity in CSU stems from
the observation that patients with CSU often have autoimmune disorders, including autoimmune thyroid disease.”
Levels of IgG anti-TPO antibodies were detected in up to
33% of CSU patients and have also been proposed as
promising biomarkers for the course of CSU, since their
presence is associated to a longer duration of the disease.'°
Besides IgG anti-TPO, high levels of IgE anti-TPO antibodies have been recently detected in a subpopulation of
CSU patients in which they might trigger mast cells and
basophils degranulation binding to circulating antigens
released after autoimmune thyroid damage.*'!-'? However,
the mechanisms whereby autoantibodies are involved in the
development of CSU are still under investigation. So far,
different mechanisms have been proposed.”'> A role of C5a
in augmenting IgG-dependent histamine release from basophils and mast cells in CU has been demonstrated in in-vitro
experiments,'*!° suggesting a role of complement components in mast cells and basophils degranulation in CSU.
Using array analyses, more than 200 IgE autoantigens,
either soluble or membrane-bound, were recently found in
patients with CSU but not detected in control subjects. In
particular, IgE anti-IL-24 were found in all patients with
CSU, and showed an association with more severe disease,
as proven by the urticaria activity score (UAS), and with a
decrease in basophils count.'° While there are several
evidences of the role of IgE anti-TPO in CSU, the role
of total IgE level is still not well defined, even if interesting data support their usefulness as biomarker of response
to anti-IgE therapy with omalizumab.'” In fact, a reduced
efficacy of omalizumab has been reported in those patients
with low level of total IgE.'*!° Furthermore, basal levels
of total IgE seem to correlate with time to relapse of
CSU after discontinuation of omalizumab treatment.
Interestingly, data from a small group of CSU patients
suggest that the number of circulating basophils and their
activity could be related to the clinical features of the
disease. In fact, a negative linear correlation between
basophil numbers and UAS has been observed in untreated
CSU patients,”° probably due to the recruitment from the
circulation to the skin lesions.?!? Furthermore, analysis
of basophil surface receptors demonstrated a link between
the percentage of CD203c-expressing basophils and

severity of the disease.***4 Basophil CD203c expression
turned out to be higher in severe than in non-severe CSU,
suggesting that the quantification of basophil activation by
measuring CD203c may be used as potential predictor of
severe CSU." Interestingly, the lack of basophil CD203cupregulating activity in the serum of patients with CSU
correlates with the clinical response to omalizumab therapy and modulation of the basophil FceRI expression
seems to contribute to the clinical improvement of CSU
patients during omalizumab therapy.”*° Indeed, in CSU
higher levels of basophil FceRI expression have been
observed in those patients with good response to omalizumab and their baseline levels seem to correlate with time
of response to therapy,”’ suggesting its involvement as
predictor of response to omalizumab.?”7*

The involvement of the immune system in the pathogenesis and evolution of CSU depends not only on the
production and activity of autoantibodies, but also on the
activation of the complement system, since their components are able to induce mast cells activation.'*?° In limited studies on the role of the complement system in CSU,
it has been reported that C3 and C4 levels are significantly
increased in CSU patients but not in healthy subjects and
that their levels significantly correlate with C-reactive
protein (CRP) in CU patients, but not in healthy subjects.”?
However, the increase of C3 and C4 levels has been
observed only in a minority of severe disease (up to
5—10%), limiting their clinical usefulness as biomarkers
of disease activity.” Importantly, elevated levels of C3,
similarly to CRP, might strongly predict the cardiometabolic risk in patients with CU, especially in the severe and
long-lasting disease.*? We can also hypothesize that the
increase of C3 and C4 levels is probably due to an augmented liver synthesis in response to pro-inflammatory
cytokines, such as IL-1B, IL-6 or tumor necrosis factor
(TNF).*! Furthermore, the anaphylatoxin C3a, which is
able to stimulate secretion of various pro-inflammatory
cytokines and chemokines, is expressed on different cells
associated with urticarial inflammation, including mast
cells, basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes, and
is able to induce histamine release from skin mast cells
with consequent vasodilatation and increased permeability
of small blood vessels.*7** Parallel to C3a, it seems that
CSa is required for activation of mast cells in CU by an
IgG-dependent mechanism.'* Taken together, these results
support the role of the complement system in the pathogenesis of CSU directly, by inducing mast cell degranulation, or indirectly through amplification of the autoimmune

process. Even if the role of anaphylatoxins in the pathogenesis of CSU has been demonstrated, their usefulness as
biomarkers in CSU still needs to be proven.

According to the recent guidelines of urticaria, the only
generally available tests to screen for autoantibodies
against either IgE for FceRI are the autologous serum
skin test (ASST) and basophil activation test (BAT).' In
particular, the ASST is a non-specific test useful for evaluating the presence of any type of triggers of mast cells
and basophils degranulation, including autoantibodies. In
fact, a correlation between a positive ASST and the presence of IgG anti-FceRI and anti-IgE antibodies was
reported.*435 A positive ASST has been linked to an
active disease and a reduced basophil count;*°*? in addition, it seems that the positivity of ASST might be a good
predictor of well-controlled CU during the 6-month stepwise treatment.*° In parallel, positivity of ASST seems to
predict a slow response to omalizumab.*!

Taken together, all these results suggest that the ASST
may be a useful tool for predicting response to treatment
and monitoring therapeutic response in patients with
cu,*?’ but further studies are required.

Inflammatory Biomarkers

Several independent studies performed in CSU patients
demonstrated an important role of inflammation in the
pathogenesis and clinical features of the disease.
Recently, CRP has been proposed as a biomarker of CSU
activity and/or response to treatment. Several clinical studies showed an increase of CRP in CSU patients, especially in patients with positive ASST with a strong
correlation with other inflammatory markers (ie, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), blood leukocyte/neutrophil
counts and IL-6 serum levels) and with disease activity.23.45.46 Interestingly, in the complex scenario of the personalized medicine, CRP has also been proposed as a
biomarker of response to therapy. According to recent
studies, high levels of CRP may predict poor response to
antihistamines and good response to oral CsA.4°4748
However, we have to take in account that the levels of
CRP in CSU patients are quantitative lower than those
detected in other inflammatory or autoimmune diseases
where it is currently used as disease biomarker. Among
the pro-inflammatory mediators, IL-6 seems to be a promising biomarker in CSU, due to its pivotal role in promoting inflammatory responses via activation of IL-6
receptor. Higher levels of IL-6 were detected in CSU

patients in parallel to CRP, and its concentration seems

quence needs to be clarified. However, a potential use of
this cytokine as a biomarker of disease activity can be
hypothesized. Besides IL-6, other IL-1 family cytokines
such as IL-18 have been proposed to play a role in the
scenario of the pathogenesis of CSU. Most but not all the
studies showed an increase of IL-18 in the circulation of
CSU patients with limited information regarding its role in
the disease activity.°°>? In parallel to IL-1 family cytokines, a pathogenic role of the IL-23/IL-17 axis and TNFa in CSU has also been hypothesized. IL-17A-producing
CD4 T cells (Th17) are crucially involved in the pathogenesis of numerous autoimmune diseases. In particular, these
cells have been identified on the basis of their ability to
produce also IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, IL-6 and TNF-a and
are critically dependent on the pro-inflammatory cytokine
IL-23 for their maintenance and survival. TNF-a is produced by skin mast cells and other inflammatory cells
found at the site of urticarial lesions,** supporting its role

 

in the pathogenesis of the disease. Since increased levels
of IL-17, IL-23 and TNF-a were detected in CSU patients
where they strongly correlate with the disease activity
score, their potential role as biomarkers for disease activity
has been also suggested.** IL-31, produced primarily by
activated Th2 lymphocytes, skin-homing CD45R0 CLA*T
cells and mast cells, plays an important role in the induction of chronic skin inflammation. Higher levels of serum
IL-31 were detected in CSU patients without any correlation with disease activity.°° However, it has been observed
that following treatment with omalizumab their levels significantly decreased, suggesting its potential role as a
biomarker of response to omalizumab.*° In the scenario
of inflammatory mediators involved in the pathogenesis
and clinical setting of CSU, an imbalance between proand anti-inflammatory adipokines has been proposed.
Indeed, an increase in the levels of lipocalin-2 (LCN2),
in parallel to a reduction of adiponectin, was reported in
CU patients.*” Interestingly, further studies demonstrated
that the levels of LCN2 inversely correlated with the
activity of the disease and patients with high LNC2 levels
were those who responded to antihistamine therapy. Taken
together, these results highlight the potential usefulness of
the pro- and anti-inflammatory components of adipokines
as biomarkers not only for disease activity, but also for the
clinical response to specific therapies.

Biomarkers Of Angiogenesis,
Coagulation And Vascular

Dysregulation

Angiogenesis is the growth of new blood vessels from
preexisting ones. It is a multistep and highly orchestrated
process involving vessel sprouting, endothelial cell migration, proliferation and tube formation.°** Under physiologic
conditions, angiogenesis depends on the balance of positive and negative angiogenic mediators within the vascular
microenvironment and requires the functional activities of
several mediators, including angiogenic factors, extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, adhesion molecules, and
proteolytic enzymes.°* Angiogenesis is primarily involved
in physiological processes, but it plays an active role in
several pathological conditions, such as chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and tumor growth.*? Several pro-angiogenic
mediators have been identified. Among them, VEGF is the
most potent pro-angiogenic mediator and its expression is
often increased in chronic inflammatory diseases.
Recently, the presence of new blood vessels in the skin
of CSU patients has been reported.®° The lesional skin
contained significantly more CD31-positive endothelial
cells compared to the normal skin and increased vascularity was also confirmed by confocal imaging, using the
lectin Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1. The formation of new
vessels as well as the increased number of eosinophils,
neutrophils, basophils, and macrophages in the skin suggest a direct contribution of these inflammatory cells in the
formation of blood vessels.°' High levels of VEGF have
been observed in the circulation and in the tissue of CSU
patients,°’ suggesting its direct effect on vascular leakage
as well as on new blood vessels formation. We can also
hypothesize that mast cells and infiltrating eosinophils and
basophils often present in skin lesions of CSU patients
might contribute to the release of VEGF with consequent
increase in vascular permeability. However, mast cells,
eosinophils, and basophils are not only a source of
VEGF, but they might be targets of this pro-angiogenic
mediator, leading to perpetuation and amplification of
inflammatory processes.© The functional activity of
VEGF is tightly regulated by endogenous anti-angiogenic
mediators mainly produced by the degradation of ECM
components such as endostatin (ES) and thrombospondin1 (TSP-1). We have recently reported increased levels of
ES and TSP-1 in the sera of CSU patients, which do not
correlate with the activity of the disease. Thus, these
anti-angiogenic mediators, able to exert multiple activities

during inflammation and angiogenesis, might be involved
in the pathogenesis of CSU. We have to take into account
that besides their anti-angiogenic activities, ES and TSP-1
also exert other important roles in the skin. For example,
TSP-1 destabilizes a contact between endothelial cells due
to its direct effect on the cells, contributing to skin vasodilation and consequent extravasation. ES, a proteolytic
fragment of collagen type XVIII, acts as a vasoactive
mediator due to its direct effect on endothelial cells via
NO synthesis.°+® Therefore, both ES and TSP-1 might
contribute to the vascular leakage in the skin of CSU
patients, leading to the development of its clinical manifestations, such as wheals and flare formation. Since these
mediators, although increased in the serum of CSU
patients, do not correlate with disease activity or other
clinical parameters, they cannot be considered biomarkers
of the disease. Parallel to ECM components, some members of MMPs were observed to be increased in the circulation of CSU patients.2> Among them, MMP-9 is
increased in the peripheral blood of CSU patients, both
adults and children, and it is suggested that its contribution
to CSU pathogenesis is probably due to its direct effect on
tissue remodeling.?**°°*” Furthermore, MMP-9, produced
by several inflammatory cells, including macrophages,
neutrophils, T cells, and mast cells, promotes migration
and activation of immune cells by cleaving pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines and therefore contributing
to the inflammatory processes. However, some but not
all studies showed an association between plasma levels of
MMP-9 and disease activity.>>°””° Therefore, further stu

in the activity and progression of CSU.” During angiogenesis, VEGF also promotes an increased expression of
leukocyte adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1,
VCAM-1, and E-selectin.’' The soluble forms of ICAM1 and VCAM-1 are widely used as biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and their increase in the circulation
and skin biopsies of patients with CSU seems to reflect a
pro-inflammatory endothelium phenotype.?*’”7>_ The
enhanced expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 is involved
in pathogenesis of wheal, since they induce augmented
permeability of vessels. Furthermore, an increase of the
soluble form of endothelial (VE)-cadherin (s VE-cadherin),
an endothelial cell-specific adhesion molecule located at
the junction between endothelial cells, has been reported
in patients with CSU.’ Moreover, serum levels of
sVE-cadherin were closely associated with the severity
of the disease, suggesting that this soluble adhesion

molecule might be useful for evaluating the severity of
CSU.” Since histamine can induce VE-cadherin phosphorylation, increased sVE-cadherin levels might, at least
in part, be a consequence of histamine release and antihistamine therapy might attenuate histamine-induced
VE-cadherin damage.”

Recently, the detection of increased levels of factor
Vila, prothrombin fragment 1+2, and D-dimer in CSU
patients suggests that, following endothelial cell activation, tissue factors are released with consequent activation
of the extrinsic coagulation cascade and secondary
fibrinolysis.*”7>»”° These results are of particular interest
considering that thrombin can increase vascular permeability and is a potent inducer of mast cell degranulation, at
least in experimental models.’’ Furthermore, the levels of
prothrombin fragment 1+2 and D-dimer seem to correlate
with the activity of the disease. In particular, the level of
D-dimer significantly correlates with UAS in CSU as well
as in acute urticaria, suggesting its role as a marker of
disease severity in both forms of urticaria.’**! Evidences
for a possible association between the levels of D-dimer
and CRP and between these mediators and disease activity
are still limited. Thus, it is possible to hypothesize a role
of activation of the coagulation system and inflammation
in CSU pathogenesis,** but it has not yet been demonstrated that the increase in the levels of D-dimer is
restricted to the CSU rather than due to comorbidities
common in patients with CSU, such as chronic infections

and autoimmune disorders.©

Recently, D-dimer has been
proposed as a marker of resistance to antihistamine therapy, response to omalizumab treatment and a useful tool to
monitor clinical response to CsA.374**3-*4 Regarding the
usefulness of the D-dimer detection during omalizumab
therapy, conflicting results have been reported by Marzano
et al who have not confirmed the link between D-dimer
and response to omalizumab treatment in CSU.°°

Since higher mean platelet volume (MPV) is associated
with inflammatory conditions, MPV has been explored as
biomarker of disease activity in CSU.*°*’ In particular, the
severity score of CU was significantly correlated to the MPV
in patients with positive ASST, but not in those with negative
ASST.*? It has been hypothesized that MPV plays a role in
the inflammatory processes underlying CSU and it might be a
marker of disease activity.>” However, these promising
results were not confirmed in other studies.** A higher platelet count was instead found in CSU patients with more severe
disease activity, positively related with serum CRP concentration, suggesting that acute phase response in CSU is

Journal of Asthma and Allergy 2019:12

Puxeddu et al

associated with the increased number of circulating platelets
in patients with more severe symptoms.**

Clinical Biomarkers

Several studies have demonstrated the usefulness of different
clinical markers of disease severity, response to therapies and
remission of the disease in CSU.*? Some data showed how
age could be inversely associated with disease severity and
improvement rates are significantly higher in patients <19
years old as compared to adults.*°°! Furthermore, it seems
that the age of CSU patients significantly predicts the quality
of life impairment assessed with the disease-specific quality
of life instrument CU-Q2oL. In particular, it has been
observed that younger patients were more affected on functioning and itching/embarrassment, whereas older patients
were more severely affected on sleep and swelling/eating.®?
Epidemiological studies showed that most CSU patients are

 

females between 20 and 59 years old and being female seems
to be a predictor of longer time of remission and quality of
life impairment.*°°?°> Although studies are limited, it
appears that sex hormones could play a role as triggers of
the disease in a small subset of patients.”* Most of the women
studied did not experience CU before puberty; worsening
symptoms was observed in a small group of pregnant women
during urticaria, and hormonal contraception was associated
with aggravation of symptoms in a minority of women.”
Furthermore, a decreased serum concentration of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S) was observed in CSU
patients, with levels significantly lower in symptomatic
patients than in disease remission.°>°° Currently, it is not
clear if a neuroendocrine-immune dysfunction, due to psychological stress, contributes directly to CSU pathogenesis or
it is indeed an epiphenomenon: thus, DHEA supplementation
as adjuvant therapy for the disease cannot be recommended.
The duration of the disease has been also proposed as marker
of severity.!°? In particular, the improvement of urticaria
during treatment has been reported in patients with duration
<1 year compared to a longer period.*® The duration of the
disease was also correlated with the presence of angioedema
and the positivity of anti-thyroid antibodies.'° In particular,
the presence of angioedema is identified as a factor strictly
related to a less favorable prognosis since CSU patients who
show concomitant angioedema have longer disease duration
and time to remission.'°*? In around 10-50% of CSU
patients, the association with inducible urticaria leads to a
longer disease duration with remission rates observed only in
21% after 1 year of the disease compared to 47% in patients
without angioedema.*?

Potential markers of CSU have also been investigated
in patients with co-morbidities. Among them, arterial
hypertension has been associated with long duration of
urticaria and patients with CSU are characterized by an
increased risk of development of hypertension.*° Recently,
in Korean patients with CU and concomitant metabolic
syndrome (MS) the levels of eosinophil cationic protein
(ECP), TNFa, and the complement components C3 and C4
were significantly higher than those in CU without MS.””
Prevalence of MS is significantly greater in patients with
CSU than in healthy controls and it seems to be an independent predictor of uncontrolled CSU.* Therefore,
patients with severe and uncontrolled CSU should be
evaluated for a concomitant MS in order to reduce their
cardiovascular risk and to improve the urticaria outcomes.
It is still unclear whether the increase of systemic inflammation is just an epiphenomenon or it might play a role in
the pathogenesis of CU.’ Furthermore, exacerbations of
CU following aspirin or NSAIDs intake have been associated with more severe CU and its duration.*°°*°? As
observed in other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases,
the lack of response to treatment in CSU is a relevant
marker of severity of the disease. Increasing evidences
demonstrate how the failure to respond to high-dose antihistamines, up to four times the usual dose as indicated by
recent guidelines,! is related to more severe disease.”
Those patients not responding to anti-histamine therapy
usually require omalizumab or other immunosuppressive
agents as a second-line treatment. Actually, specific markers that may help to predict a poor response to first-line
therapy have not been identified. Some data suggest that
increased complement CSa fraction, elevated D-dimer
plasma levels, positivity of the ASST or BAT, as well as
other clinical indicators of severity, may be potential markers of response to first-line therapy.“4°*' In patients
under omalizumab treatment, a significant correlation
between response to therapy a positive Basophil
Histamine Release Assay (BHRA) has been observed.'®!
In those patients under CsA therapy, it has been demonstrated a positive correlation between response to therapy
and BAT, BHRA and ASST but a negative correlation with
high levels of D-dimer.**+!°?-!™ In particular, the basal Ddimer levels have been proposed as useful marker for
monitoring the clinical response to CsA treatment.’*

evolution and response to treatments or to monitor the
activity of CSU and the efficacy of treatment.

Recently, the complex role of heat shock proteins (Hsp)
in inflammation and immunity has been objective of attention, due to their ability to promote cytokines production
and adhesion molecules expression and to play modulatory
roles in both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses,
as well as in the complement activation. Among Hsp,
increased circulating levels of Hsp70 and anti-Hsp70 antibodies were detected in CSU patients,'°> however the
mechanism and clinical significance of this observation in
CSU remain to be clarified. Hsp70 seems to exert a protecting role, by promoting anti-inflammatory immunoregulatory
T-cell responses, and in parallel to exert a pro-inflammatory
effect, by activating NF-«B pathway and IL-6 signaling
system. Since Hsp may act as an autoantigen, it has been
hypothesized that Hsp70 triggers both cell-mediated and
humoral immune responses in CSU and anti-Hsp70 antibodies may activate pro-inflammatory processes. In addition,
patients with moderate-severe CSU show higher plasma
Hsp70 concentration and higher anti-Hsp70 antibodies
levels, although no significant difference was identified
between moderate-severe and mild disease activity.'°
Thus, the potential pathogenic role of Hsp70 and antiHsp70 antibodies in CSU and their usefulness as biomar
 

kers remain to be elucidated by further investigations.

It has also been proposed that oxidative stress contributes to CSU pathogenesis by modulating enzymatic function and by inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines release.
Their effects seem to be the results of an imbalance
between ROS production and the effectiveness of antioxidant defense mechanisms. Nettis et al have recently investigated the role of advanced glycation end products
(AGEs)
(AOPPs) as new potential oxidative stress biomarkers in
CSU, reporting levels of AOPPs, but not that of AGEs,

significantly higher in CSU patients.

A fundamental contribution in understanding the
mechanisms of gene modulation comes from epigenetic
studies, conducted recently also in skin diseases, including
urticaria. This field deals in particular with inheritable and
potentially reversible modifications of DNA which can
modulate gene expression without altering DNA sequence
and which may be influenced by environmental factors. In
this context, microRNAs (miRNA) represent an important
class of small non-coding RNAs, that induce gene silencing by binding to target sites of the targeted messenger
RNA. Growing interest has recently been given to the

involvement of miRNA in skin disorders because of their
potential ability to influence regulatory mechanisms of
inflammation. Five miRNAs (2355-3p, 4264, 2355—5p,
29c-5p, and 361-3p) were found to be significantly
increased in CSU. Thus, these five miRNAs, which target
genes associated with several cellular functions such as
cellular motility, regulation of leukocyte migration, and
inflammatory response, have been suggested as biomarkers for chronic autoimmune urticaria.'°”

Furthermore, the expression of upregulated or downregulated miRNA was recently investigated in CSU
patients and the data were then validated by reverse transcription qPCR. The expression of miR-125a-5p and
CCL17 levels were found to be significantly increased in
the sera of these patients and significantly decreased in the
remission phase of the disease, suggesting a potential use

its usefulness as a biomarker of the disease has yet to be

Conclusion

In the last year, several studies have been published in
order to better understand the pathogenic mechanisms
underlying CSU and to identify potential biomarkers of
both disease activity and response to therapies (Table 1).
Several cells of the immune system, soluble mediators,
adhesion molecules, autoantibodies, complement and
coagulation system components contribute to mast cells
and basophil activation and degranulation, leading to the
development of CSU. Many of the above-mentioned
cells and mediators seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, but none of these seems to be
really specific to CSU. Several of these mediators correlate with the UAS, suggesting their potential use as
biomarkers of disease activity. Furthermore, some clinical aspects of CSU and co-morbidities have been proposed as potential biomarkers of duration of the disease
