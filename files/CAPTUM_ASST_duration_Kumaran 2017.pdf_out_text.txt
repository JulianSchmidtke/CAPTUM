Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is
a common disorder with a complicated,
incompletely fathomed  etiopathogenesis.
CSU is defined as daily or almost daily
occurrence of wheals for at least 6 weeks
with or without angioedema. It is commonly
reported between 4" and 6" decades of life
with a female preponderance.'"! Despite the
availability of a broad panel of diagnostic
tests, identification of specific causative
factor in CSU remains elusive.

Circulating mast cell-activating agents
have been identified in blood of CSU
patients; a subgroup of these patients
has autoantibodies directed against the
IgE receptor FceRI or against IgE that
functions as mast cell-activating signals.
These autoantibodies have been shown to
activate blood basophils and cutaneous
mast cells in vitro. The presence of
these autoantibodies may be clinically
important in a group of severely affected,

treatment-resistant patients, where
immunomodulatory treatments may be
valuable. Patients with autoantibodies

have no distinctive diagnostic clinical

features. Autoimmune and non-autoimmune
cases are indistinguishable clinically and
histologically. However, they do tend to
have more severe urticaria.-3)

Autologous serum skin test (ASST) is a
simple in-vivo clinical test for the detection
of basophil histamine-releasing activity.
Sabroe et al. found that ASST has a
sensitivity of approximately 70% and a
specificity of 80%, and it may be used as a
reasonably predictive clinical test to indicate
the presence of functional circulating
autoantibodies.'") A positive ASST has been
associated with prolonged disease that is
poorly responsive to routine therapy. One
important advantage of testing is to promote
a more tailored prognostic counseling and
earlier use of immunosuppressive drugs.""4)
Studies have also demonstrated a significant
relation between chronic idiopathic urticaria
(CIU) diagnosed by ASST and clinical
parameters like frequency of attacks,
duration of individual episodes, duration
of wheals, regional involvement, and being
less responsive to conventional antihistamine
therapy.'*'*! Albeit ASST is commonly used

Kumaran, et a/.: ASST and APST: A reappraisal

30-67% of patients in CSU,'"*) concerns have been raised
regarding its interpretation and specificity.

The basophil histamine release assay is currently the gold
standard for detecting functional autoantibodies in the serum
of patients with chronic urticaria. However, this bioassay is
difficult to standardize because it requires fresh basophils
from healthy donors and it is also time consuming, hence
it remains restricted to scientific research. Hence, ASST is
considered to be a bedside clinical test that can detect the
presence of autoimmunity in patients with CIU. Depending
on the method of antibody detection, various studies have
reported that the prevalence of ASST positivity in patients
of chronic urticaria varies from 35% to 58%."

Asero et al. have reported that the autologous plasma
skin test (APST) is more sensitive than ASST, but cannot
be considered as a screening test for histamine-releasing
autoantibodies.''*] The prevalence of ASST positivity
ranges from 42% to 68% whereas the prevalence of APST
positivity varies from 14% to 97%. APST generates more
positive responses than ASST because plasma contains
coagulation factors and complements, which are consumed
in the formation of clots in ASST, and hence, less positive
results are seen.) The demonstration of autoantibodies
in only some patients with positive ASST and APST
(25-50%) confirms that there are factors other than
autoantibodies that play a role in the etiology of urticaria.

Although the literature includes various results, these
variations depend on multiple factors, including methods
of skin test, interpretation criteria of skin test results,
type of anticoagulant, centrifuging blood specimen,
and methods of serum separation. For example Asero
et al. used ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as an
anticoagulant, and hence the positive results reported to
be 97% of the cases.''”'*! All relevant studies so far have
reported that both the APST and ASST can be used for
diagnostic purposes in patients with chronic autoimmune
urticaria (CAU).""%"! Which of these is more sensitive and
whether or not their positivity correlates with the disease
severity, varies between different studies and cannot be
decisively concluded.

Although many studies have assessed these two
investigations individually, there is scarcity of studies that
have compared the two, and to our knowledge, no study
has investigated the significance of responses in both these
tests. Hence, we wanted to compare the results of ASST
and APST in patients with CSU and correlated the intensity
of response with various clinicoepidemiological parameters.

Materials and Methods

All patients of chronic urticaria attending the urticaria
clinic at our institute were screened for | year; 150 chronic
urticaria patients, aged >18 years, having a disease duration
longer than 6 months were enrolled. CSU was defined as
patients suffering from urticaria for more than 6 weeks

duration. Those with a history of physical urticaria and
pregnant and lactating women were excluded from the
study; 100 age and sex-matched healthy controls were also
studied to observe the distribution of ASST, APST, serum
IgE levels, and thyroid profile among general population.
The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics
Committee, and a written informed consent was obtained
from all patients and volunteers.

Medical history and physical examination was noted on a
predesigned proforma. Laboratory investigations including
complete blood count, metabolic panel, urine and stool
analysis, serum IgE levels, ANA, and thyroid function tests
(TFTs) were performed.

ASST and APST tests were performed as per standard
guidelines."'°"! Patients were advised to stop antihistamines,
doxepin, and steroids 2 days, 1 week, and 3 weeks prior to
the test, respectively.

To obtain serum, venous blood (3 ml) was taken in a sterile
glass tube without clotting accelerator and allowed to clot
at room temperature for 30 minutes. Serum was separated
by centrifugation at 500 g for 15 minutes.

To obtain plasma, 4 ml of venous blood was collected in a
sterile vacutainer containing 0.5 ml of 0.105 mol/l sodium
citrate. These samples were kept at room temperature for
15 minutes, and then centrifuged for 3 min at 1250 g to
obtain plasma.

Histamine diphosphate 10 g/ml and sterile physiological
saline (0.9%) were used as positive and negative controls,
respectively.

Fifty microlitres (two units of 40 units/1 ml insulin syringe)
of each autologous plasma, serum, sterile physiological
saline, and histamine were injected intradermally into the
volar aspect of the left forearm keeping a gap of 3-5 cm.
Areas known to be involved in whealing in previous 24
hours were avoided. Strict aseptic precautions were
followed.

 

Wheal diameter was recorded at 30 minutes as the average

of two maximum perpendicular diameters measured with

the help of a measuring scale. ASST and APST were

considered to be positive if the wheal induced by serum

or plasma, respectively, was >2 mm in diameter than that

induced by saline. The intensity of this positive response

was graded arbitrarily:

e + (low intensity) = <3 mm with no_ peripheral
surrounding erythema

e 2+ (moderate intensity) = 4-6 mm with mild peripheral
erythema

e 3+ (high intensity) = >6 mm with bright red peripheral
erythema.

Statistical analysis

For interpretation of the results, descriptive statistical
methods (mean, standard deviation) as well as unpaired

t-test for comparison of groups, Chi-square test, and odds
ratio for comparing quantitative data were performed.

Results

Among 150 CSU patients screened, 100 were eligible, of
which 48 were males and 52 were females (M:F = 1:1.08),
with a mean age of 34.95 + 11.96 years (mean age of
females: 35.97 years; mean age of males: 33.35 years).
The mean duration of illness was 4.85 + 5.07 years. More
than half of the study cohort had experienced >2 episodes
of urticaria; 65% patients had only urticaria and remaining
had urticaria with angioedema.

Autologous serum skin test vs autologous plasma
skin test

On examining the response to autologous tests, among
100 patients, 68 were ASST (+) and 90 were APST (+).
All ASST (+) patients were also positive for APST, and
remaining 22 were only APST (+). The patients who were
only APST (+) demonstrated a female predominance (F:18,
M:4), <30 years of age, a refractory/resistant disease,
and longer duration of disease (63.6% of them requiring
immunosuppressive treatment methotrexate or cyclosporine
in the past and the remaining patients required more than
one antihistamines for disease controls). Those with only
ASST (+) and both the autologous tests positive did not
have any significant clinicoepidemiological details. Among
controls, only 8% and 4% were found to be ASST (+) and
APST (+), respectively. Comparison between the cohorts
and controls for ASST/APST positivity was statistically
significant, which was higher in patient population than
controls (P < 001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value
(NPV) are summarized in Table 1.

Intensity of response analysis

The positive response on ASST and APST were further
assessed for the intensity of response obtained; it was
observed that in APST 63, 11, and 16 patients and in ASST
48, 16, and 14 patients had + (low), ++ (moderate) and
+++ (high) positive response, respectively [Table 2]. Those
with severe response (3+) complained of increased itching
followed by burning sensation at the tested site, especially
in patients with APST (+).

Additional features observed were:

e 3+ or high intensity response on ASST and APST was
seen in 6/16 (37.5%) patients with angioedema who had
respiratory difficulty during eruption (1 patient required
hospital admission once)

e ANA was positive in 10 patients, 60% of them
demonstrated 3+ or high intensity response on both
ASST and APST; on further investigations, 4/6 patients
also had dsDNA antibody positive along with low C3
and C4 complement levels, however, none manifested
any signs and symptoms of collagen vascular disorder.

Sixteen patients demonstrated TFTs abnormalities,

hypothyroidism (n = 15), and hyperthyroidism
(n = 1). Hypothyroidism was encountered more in
females (P < 0.01). Thyroid autoantibodies were seen in
13% of patients and 4% of controls. The distribution of
anti-TPO antibodies among females and males, patients,
and controls did not show any statistically significant
variation. A significant inverse association was observed
between TFTs and APST as 92.9% of those with normal
TFTs were APST (+), (Kk = —0.062 P = 0.029).

IgE levels were found to be raised in only 9% patients;
they all had a positive family history for atopy (asthma in
6, allergic rhinitis in 3). The serum levels of IgE varied
from 500 IU to 1200 IU; 8/9 (88.9%) patients demonstrated
a moderate positive response only on APST. A significant
inverse correlation was noted between IgE levels and ASST
(+) as 84% of those with normal IgE levels were ASST (+)
(«k = -0.141 P = 0.012).

The mean urticaria activity score (UAS) among all CSU
patients was (4.2 + 1.24); these scores did not significantly
correlate with the intensity of positive response on either
ASST or APST. Correlation between the intensity of
positive response on autologous skin tests with regards to
gender, duration of disease, and thyroid status of the study
cohort did not bear any significance.

Discussion

Research is still underway to expound the enigmatic
pathogenesis of CSU. Recent studies have incriminated
platelets to play a vital role in various immune and
inflammatory disorders such as allergic dermatitis (atopic

dermatitis), psoriasis, urticaria, and inflammatory bowel
disease.?"]

Platelet activation factor-4 stimulates histamine release from
rat mast cells. Cutaneous reaction following the intradermal
injection of autologous serum and plasma in ASST and
APST reflects autoreactivity in patients with chronic
urticaria. ASST is a test for autoreactivity rather than a
specific test for autoimmune urticaria with only moderate

specificity as a marker for functional autoantibodies against
IgE or the high affinity IgE receptor (FceRI), detected by
the basophil histamine release assay, however, with a high
negative predictive value for CSU patients without them.?!)

The extrinsic pathway of clotting cascade is involved in the
pathogenesis of CSU and the disease severity is associated
with the activation of coagulation cascade."'**™4! There are
recent reports of APST to be more sensitive than ASST,"
thus it is predictable that APST generates more positive
responses than ASST because plasma contains coagulation
factors and complements.!5?7!

The prevalence of APST positivity varies between 14%
and 97% whereas that of ASST positivity ranges from
42% to 68%."°"8"l In our study, the positive prevalence
of autologous tests was 78% for ASST and 90% for
APST, which is comparatively higher than most of the
studies so far. Kocatiirk et a/.,!°! found that the specificity
of ASST and APST was similar, whereas ASST was
found to be more sensitive than APST in discriminating
between CSU patients and controls. However, in our
study we found APST to be more sensitive and specific
than ASST with a higher positive predictive value,
although it was not statistically significant. Twenty
two patients in our study were positive only for APST
and not vice versa; further analysis of these patients
demonstrated a female preponderance, <30 years of age,
longer disease duration, and resistant urticaria which was
not improving with antihistamines with 63.6% of them
requiring immunosuppressive treatment (methotrexate or
cyclosporine).

False negative and positive results with ASST have been
proposed owing to high amount of bradykinin generated
during coagulation cascade leading to the release of
proteinase enzymes that destroy CS5a and the formation
vasoactive mediators while the serum is being prepared
leads to false positive results."*! Asero et al. described
APST and suggested it to be more sensitive than ASST,!"'*)
which has been refuted by few researchers, claiming the
higher rate of APST positivity in earlier studies being
attributed to the failure to use negative control tests.228*4l
In our study, we found no significant correlations between
ASST and APST positivity with respect to gender, disease
duration, and personal or family history of atopy, which
coincides with the findings of previous studies.??53")

We wanted to observe if there was any significance of
the intensity of response during autologous skin tests in
urticaria with regards to various clinico-epidemiological
characteristics of patients. In the absence of any previous
studies dealing with the intensity of positive response, we
cannot compare our findings.

In our patients, an associated presence of angioedema
demonstrated no significant correlation with ASST and
APST outcome, as in earlier studies,?'*!***"| however, on
assessing the intensity of positive response, 37.5% patients

with severe angioedema demonstrated a high intensity
response.

An increased prevalence of antithyroid autoantibodies
among CSU patients have been cited by many researchers
with prevalence ranging between 0 and 5.6%.'°4!7] We
found thyroid autoantibodies in 13% and 4% of our patients
and controls respectively, which was not statistically
significant. However, a_ statistically significant inverse
association was noted between TFTs and APST; 92.9% of
patients who were APST (+) had normal T, and T,, TSH
and anti TPO values (P = 0.029).

The relationship between atopy and chronic urticaria has
been suggested by some authors, although some studies
have observed no correlation between the two.*5! Only 9
patients in our study provided a family history of atopy and
not in the patient per se. All of them were found to have
increased IgE levels, and 84% of patients with normal IgE
levels were ASST (+) (P < 0.05).

ANA positivity was seen in 10 patients; 6/10 demonstrated
3+ or high intensity positive response on ASST and APST.
Four out of these 6 patients had low complement (C3 and
C4) levels and dsDNA positivity. Thus, a high intensity of
response on autologous tests could signify a presence of
underlying ANA positivity, in which case the patient needs
to be followed up, along with monitoring for collagen
vascular disorder. Since there are no studies assessing the
intensity of positive response on autologous blood tests in
CSU, we are unable to compare our preliminary results.

Conclusion

Our study exemplifies that APST is probably better than
ASST in identifying autoreactivity in CSU owing to better
PPV and the presence of high intensity response on ASST/
APST, which could signify the presence of an underlying
ANA positivity or a severe angioedema, as noted in our
study. Additional studies are required to further clear the
enigma between APST and ASST and confirm and augment
our various preliminary findings.
