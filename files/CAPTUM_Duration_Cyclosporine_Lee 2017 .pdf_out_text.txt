Purpose: There are very few epidemiological studies on chronic urticaria (CU). We aimed to investigate the prevalence of CU and to depict demographics and medication patterns for the disease in a nationwide population-based study. Methods: Data on urticaria (L50 of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision) from 2010 to 2014 were obtained from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. Algorithms designed to evaluate prescription drug claims for antihistamines were applied to identify CU. Results: The crude prevalence of CU was
2,256.5 per 100,000 person-years and tended to increase every year. The age-standardized prevalence of CU was significantly higher in females
than in males (2,466.8 vs 1,819.2 per 100,000 person-years, P< 0.001). Age-specific prevalence was highest for older adults over the age of 65 years
and lowest for ages 10-29 years. The median duration of CU was 591 days, and symptoms lasted for at least 1 year in 61.9% of patients. Gastrointestinal disease was the most common comorbidity in adults, whereas allergic rhinitis and common cold were more prevalent in children with CU.
Around a third of CU patients were taking antihistamine treatment alone, and 70% were treated with both antihistamines and systemic corticosteroids. Cyclosporine was prescribed for 0.02% of CU patients. Conclusions: The present study outlines recent longitudinal epidemiological data on
the prevalence of CU in Korea. In light of limitations on the use of claims data, including no specific disease code for CU and a possible discordance
between drug claims and the presence of urticaria symptoms, further investigations are necessary to describe the exact epidemiologic profile of CU

patients.

INTRODUCTION

Urticaria is a common heterogeneous skin disease characterized by the occurrence of wheals and/or angioedema with pruritus that can be differentiated according to its duration and the
presence of eliciting factors. Acute urticaria is triggered usually
by allergens, food, medications, food additives and infections,
and is resolved within less than 6 weeks.' In contrast, itchy
wheals on the skin of patients with chronic urticaria (CU) persist
for at least 6 weeks, and most cases have no external causes to be
avoided.’ Although there are considerable differences in CU duration, reports suggest that patients, on average, suffer from urticarial symptoms for 3-5 years.’ Because of a longer duration,
sudden occurrence, intractable pruritus, and changes in appearance, CU has a significant impact on the quality of life of patients.’

Approximately one of every 5 individuals in the general population experiences an episode of urticaria in their life.> The overall prevalence of CU in North American and European popula

tions has been reported as 0.5%-1.0%.* However, knowledge of
the epidemiology, medication use, and social burden of CU is
still lacking, particularly in Asian populations. Accordingly, we
aimed to perform a nationwide epidemiologic study using the
Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service
(HIRA) database to estimate the prevalence and treatment patterns of CU in Korea.

analysis over a 5-year period using the claims database of the
HIRA, a government-affiliated organization encharged with
conducting accurate claims review and quality assessment in
support of the National Health Insurance service, which covers
around 98% of the overall Korean population.’ The claims database contains information on patient demographics, diagnosis,
treatments, procedures, prescription medications, and surgical
history. Diagnoses are based on the 6th edition of the Korean
Classification of Disease, which is a modified version of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10).
The study included patients with an ICD-10 code of L50 as the
primary diagnostic code from January 1, 2010 to December 31,
2014. Patients with CU were operationally defined by the following criteria (Fig. 1): 1) a single prescription of antihistamines
exceeding 42 days; 2) accumulating days for prescription antihistamines and/or another medication commonly used to treat
CU, including cyclosporine or systemic steroid, during the
study period for at least 42 days; and 3) a time interval between
the first and last visits under the ICD-10 code of L50 within the
study period exceeding 42 days. If the interval between visits
was less than 7 days, it was considered as a continuous visit for
controlling the same event of urticaria. If any of the 3 conditions
were identified, patients were classified into having CU. However, patients whose claims data did not meet at least one of the
above criteria were excluded. The total Korean population in
2012 from Statistics Korea was used as the standard population.

Variables
To describe treatment patterns, we categorized 5 groups of
prescription medications commonly used to treat CU. Antihis

tamines were classified into 2 groups: non-sedating (azelastine,
bepotastine, cetirizine, desloratadine, ebastine, epinastine,
fexofenadine, levocetrizine, loratadine, and mizolastine) and
sedating (chlorpheniramine, clemastine, dimenhydrinate, hydroxyzine, and piprinhydrinate). Topical steroid were excluded
in the present database. Systemic corticosteroids were classified into oral and parenteral corticosteroids according to their
administration route. The last medication category was cyclosporine. Total days for prescription medications and numbers
of patients who used medications individually and in combination were reported. Any medications without a prescription,
such as over-the-counter antihistamines, were not included in
the current database.

To characterize comorbidities, we sorted the most frequently
combined diagnostic codes in conjunction with urticaria from
the database. Gastroduodenitis (K29), allergic rhinitis (J30),
acute bronchitis (J20), hypertension (110), asthma (J45), and
atopic dermatitis (K59) were identified as common comorbidities in patients with CU.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics were applied for all measures. Data analyses were performed using SAS statistical software, version 9.4
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). All statistical tests were
2-sided, and P<0.05 were considered significant. Crude and
age-standardized prevalence rates were estimated by Poisson
regression and reported as person-years and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs). By considering characteristics of population
structure each year, age-standardization was performed. The
standardized population for age-standardization was calculat

ed by adding the population numbers from 2010 to 2014 according to age groups (<10, 10-29, 30-64, and =65 years) each
year. Linear regression analyses were used to evaluate time
trends in the prevalence of CU. Chi-square tests were utilized to
analyze trends among age groups. Means and standard deviations are reported for continuous variables, while counts and
percentages are presented for categorical variables. In regards
to urticaria duration, since we confirmed that the distribution
was skewed to the left and did not follow normal distribution,
the median value is reported.

mining CU (Fig. 1), 39.7% (5,599,940) of all cases were classified
as having CU over the 5-year period (Table 1). Of all CU cases,
4.8% were obtained by the first criterion, 8.0% by the second
criterion, and 87.2% by the third criterion (266,714 vs 450,424 vs
4,882,802 cases, respectively). The annual CU ratio of total patients having urticaria was on average 23.5% over the 5-year
study period.

The crude prevalence of CU was 2,256.5 (95% CI, 2,252.32,260.6) per 100,000 person-years (Fig. 2). The annual prevalence of CU consistently increased from 1,662.3 per 100,000
persons in 2010 to 2,310.8 per 100,000 persons in 2014 (Fig. 2).
For 2010-2014, the age-adjusted prevalences of CU were 2,138.4
(2,134.3-2,142.4) per 100,000 person-years overall, 1,819.2
(1,813.9-1,824.6) per 100,000 person-years among men, and
2,466.8 (2,460.7-2,472.9) per 100,000 person-years among
women (P<0.001, Table 2). The age-specific prevalence of CU
was highest in older adults over the age of 65 years and lowest
in ages 10-29 years. The age-specific prevalence of urticaria that
did meet our set of criteria for CU was highest in children
younger than 10 years. Chi-square tests for analyzing trends revealed significantly different prevalence rates of CU among age

groups (Table 2, P<0.001).

The prevalence of CU according to sex also differed according
to age (Fig. 3), that is, the prevalence of CU was higher in boys
than in girls among children under the age of 10 years, although
it was significantly higher in females than in males among adolescent and adults older than 15 years. The median duration of
urticaria was estimated as 591 days, with an interquartile range
of 256-1,054 in CU patients. Among CU patients, the durations
of prescription medications were shorter than 3 months in
12.0%, from 3 to 12 months in 26.2%, from 12 to 24 months in
23.0%, from 24 to 36 months in 17.7%, from 36 to 48 months in
13.4%, and longer than 48 months in 7.8% (Fig. 4).

Table 3 depicts the clinical characteristics of and medication
prescription days and patterns in patients with CU. The mean
age of the CU patients was 41.6+ 23.2 years. CU patients visited
medical clinics on an average of 6.7 times and took medicines
for a mean of 45.0 days. Of all CU patients, 27.2% were prescribed antihistamines alone, and 69.9% received combined
medicines with antihistamines and systemic corticosteroids.
Among patients receiving antihistamines, 49.7% were given sedating antihistamines, and 69.7% were prescribed non-sedating antihistamines. Mean days for prescribing antihistamines
were significantly higher with non-sedating antihistamines,
compared to sedating antihistamines (45.8£126.5 vs 20.84
68.7 days, P<0.001). Mean days for supply of systemic corticosteroids differed from 3.25.6 days for parenteral corticosteroids to 17.7+42.3 days for oral corticosteroids (P<0.001). In
contrast, cyclosporine was prescribed only for 0.02% of CU patients. Mean prescription days for cyclosporine reached 66.7 +
105.3 days over the 5-year study period.

They had visited clinics under a primary diagnosis of urticaria
1.5 times as a mean, with 5.0 days of prescription medication
use (Table 3). Only 210 (<0.01%) of 8,496,770 patients in the
non-CU group had been prescribed cyclosporine. These findings indicated that most of the patients that did not fulfill the
criteria for CU in the present study might be patients with acute
urticaria.

The most common comorbidities in CU patients were gastrointestinal disease, allergic rhinitis, and common cold (62.8% vs
32.4% vs 26.9%, respectively, Table 4). In adults, especially those
older than 30 years, gastrointestinal disease was the most common comorbid disorder (age of 30-64, 68.9%; =65, 71.9%).

logical study on CU in Korea. Between 2010 and 2014, an estimated age-adjusted prevalence of 2,138.4 (95% CI, 2,134.32,142.4) per 100,000 person-years in CU was obtained using a
nationwide database in Korea. The annual prevalence of CU
has been increasing year by year, and the overall ratio of CU
among all urticaria patients was on average 23.5% over the
5-year study period. Age-specific prevalence showed 2 peaks in
children younger than 10 years old and older adults aged 65
years and older. Female predilection of CU was also noted in
patients older than 15 years in the present study, whereas in
those younger than 10 years, a significantly higher prevalence
of CU was found in boys than in girls.

Although study populations and methods vary among studies, estimates in previous reports on the prevalence of CU have
ranged from 0.05% to 3.0%.’ A prior questionnaire survey conducted among the general population of Germany revealed a
lifetime prevalence for CU of 1.8% and a period prevalence of
0.8% for active CU within the past 12 months.’ The authors of
another study in Spain utilized a similar questionnaire survey
to estimate the real prevalence of CU in the adult general population. While they found a 0.6% prevalence of active CU, 2.9% of
the nationwide sample of adults was recognized as having had
urticaria for more than 6 weeks.’ As these questionnaires-based
population studies are dependent on the patients’ participation
and memories, there might be recall bias and limitations of
fewer respondents among children and older adults. Therefore,
the CU prevalence covering 5 years in Korea would be comparable to the lifetime prevalence of 1.8% and 2.9% for German’
and Italian® populations.

Similar to the present study, recent studies have also used insurance claims databases to investigate the prevalence of
chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU).*" Zazzali et al.? adopted
algorithms for defining CSU as the presence of at least one outpatient International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision,
Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code of 708.1, 708.8, or 708.9
and a second diagnosis of the same codes later than 6 weeks
from 2010 to 2013, the presence of angioedema (ICD-9-CM
code of 995.1) for at least 6 weeks from the urticaria diagnosis,
or 90-day use of prescription medications for treating CSU,
such as antihistamine and montelukast, cyclosporine, methotrexate, or oral corticosteroids. They identified an estimated

1-year period prevalence of 0.08% for CSU.’ The proportions of
CU patients were dependent on the 3 different conditions target by our algorithms. Of all patients with CU, 87.2% were selected by condition 3, followed by conditions 2 (8.0%) and 1
(4.8%). These are consistent with prior results by Zazzali et al.
in that a second urticaria claim at 6 weeks or later was the most
common reason for inclusion (82.2%) as a patient with CU, followed by days of prescription medications used to treat CSU
(16.7%). Lapi et al.'° used similar algorithms as those in the
aforementioned study for patients aged =15 years between
2002 and 2013 in Italy. Therein, the annual prevalence of CSU
ranged from 0.02% in 2002 to 0.38% in 2013."° According to the
literature, of patients having non-acute urticaria, 66%-93% have
been found to have CSU.’ Since we selected all patients with urticaria, regardless of their etiologies and ages, the age-adjusted
prevalence rate of CU of 2,138.4 per 100,000 person-years over
a 5-year of study period was a little higher than rates in previous
reports limited to CSU.°"° Moreover, differences in ethnicity,
geographic distributions, and criteria for identifying CU may
have also contributed to the variations in the prevalence of CU
among different studies. Because the criteria for selecting CU in
our study did not consider the presence of angioedema and focused on the use of antihistamines, it would be difficult to extrapolate the prevalence of CSU for the Korean population
based on the present results. Further studies using previous validated algorithms’ for CSU are needed to confirm whether the
real prevalences of CSU, as well as CU, are higher in Korea than
in other countries.

Consistent with other studies, we confirmed that the age-adjusted prevalence of CU was higher in females than in males
among adults older than 15 years: 66.7% in the US,’ 63% in Israel," 69.8% in Turkey,” 70.3% in Germany,’ and 79% in Thailand.’ Considering that autoimmune mechanisms are involved in about half of all CU cases, a female predilection in the
prevalence of CU is acceptable, as it is a common feature in various autoimmune disorders.’ However, we found that in children younger than 10 years, the prevalence of CU was significantly higher in boys than in girls. A recent questionnarirebased study on Korean children also reported a higher prevalence of CU in boys, although no statistical significance was
noted.'® Furthermore, differences in other allergic diseases between boys and girls have been shown by other studies,'*”” in
which, compared with girls, boys show higher incidences of
asthma, allergic rhinitis, and anaphylaxis during childhood.

In general, the peak incidence of CU is observed between 20
and 40 years of age.*'*"* The mean age of CU patients was 41.6
years in Korea from 2010 to 2014 in the present study. In a previous claims-based research on CU epidemiology in the US, the
mean age of the patients was 41.0 years, the same as that in the
present study. A recent cross-sectional study using questionnaires reported that the prevalence of CU in children aged from
4 to 13 years was 1.8% in Korea."° This is in line with the present

results that approximately 3.2% (3,253.6 per 100,000 personyears) in children aged less than 10 years and around 1.5%
(1,470.9 per 100,000 person-years) in 10-29 years were estimated as CU patients. Meanwhile, previous retrospective observational studies or phone surveys have found the age group of 45
to 64 years to show the highest prevalence of CU.”*”® However,
we found that the prevalence of CU was higher in patients over
the age of 65 years and younger than 10 years, compared to other age groups. In agreement with our results, a recent population-based study using claims data in Italy indicated that, based
on the prevalence of CU in individuals younger than 20 years,
the adjusted hazard ratio of CU increased significantly in patients aged 60-79 years, while it was significantly decreased in
patients of ages 20-29 and 30-39 years.'” However, our results
are limited in that information on over-the-counter medications was not available for analysis in the present study, nor in
the previous Italian studies. Considering that younger individuals, particularly those of ages from 20 to 40 years are more
prone to take over-the-counter antihistamines, we could not
simply conclude that the prevalence of CU is higher in older
adults than in middle-aged adults. In order to clarify epidemiological results on CU, further studies with data on the use of
over-the-counter medications and validation of our algorithms
based on clinical chart reviews are needed.

The median duration of CU in the present study population
was 1.6 years, which is similar to previous reports.'°” Over a
5-year period, only 12% of CU patients stopped visiting clinics
within 3 months in our study; the highest proportion of patients
was treated for 12-24 months, accounting for 23% of all patients
with CU. In our findings, 38.2% of CU patients had stopped visiting clinics under the diagnosis of urticaria within 1 year,
whereas another 38.9% had remained in the claims database
for at least 3 years. A previous retrospective study on 450 patients with CU in Thailand revealed a consistent result with the
present study in that 34.5% of CU patients had symptom remission within 1 year.’ Toubi et al."' reported that, in more than
70% of 139 patients with CU, urticaria lasted for more than 1
year, whereas we found that 61.9% of patients in our study were
treated for CU for more than 1 year.

In regards to medication use, 27.2% of CU patients used antihistamines alone, while only 1.1% used systemic corticosteroids without antihistamines. Among antihistamine users,
69.5% took non-sedating ones, and 49.7% had prescriptions for
sedating antihistamines. In a previous retrospective study of
distributions of medications used for CU patients, the authors
observed that 72% and 46% of patients were taking non-sedating and sedating antihistamines, respectively.”' In contrast,
69.9% of patients received combined medicines, antihistamines, and systemic corticosteroids in the present study. A recent claims-based study in the US also revealed that the most
common prescription pattern for CU population was a combination of non-sedating antihistamines with at least one course

of oral corticosteroids;? however, this was recorded for only
31.0% of their study patients, which is almost half that noted in
our study. Moreover, oral corticosteroids (70.9%) were the most
common medication, comparable to the frequency of prescription non-sedating antihistamines (69.5%) in the present study,
whereas 53.7% of patients in the study by Zazzali et al. used
oral corticosteroids. Taken together, while the patterns of prescription urticaria medication use in Korea were similar to
those in US,’ relatively more frequent use of systemic corticosteroids was observed in the present study. Notwithstanding,
insurance claims do not link prescriptions with diagnoses in
the HIRA database, and sometimes, oral corticosteroids can be
used for treating other combined diseases.

In our study population, gastrointestinal disease was most
commonly associated with CU, followed by allergic rhinitis,
common cold, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and hypertension, in
that order. The rank ordering of frequently combined diseases
was dependent on the ages of the CU patients. The most common comorbidity among patients of ages over 5 years was gastrointestinal disease, rates of which increased with age. Interestingly, a recent meta-analysis demonstrated a significant association between Helicobacter pylori infection and CU.” A
higher prevalence of H. pylori infection in Korea could plausibly explain the high frequency of gastrointestinal diseases as a
comorbidity of CU in the present study.”* However, as HIRA
data are collected for the purposes of reimbursing healthcare
services, the code of K29 could be added to diagnoses when
prescribing H2 receptor antagonists for controlling urticarial
symptoms and not for treating gastrointestinal diseases in CU
patients. In contrast, common cold and allergic rhinitis were
the most common comorbidities in children younger than 5
years. In agreement with our findings, allergic rhinitis and asthma were noted as the most frequent comorbidities in another
claims-based study.’ In Italy, different findings were observed
for a 12-year period longitudinal database." Although they enrolled patients older than 15 years, they noted a higher risk of
developing CSU in patients with malignancies and anxiety, as
well as in obese individuals, whereas allergy had no impact on
the risk for CU."° Meanwhile, we investigated patients of all ages
registered in the HIRA database, and a higher prevalence of CU
in younger subjects was noted. For these reasons, our analyses
may not have identified anxiety, diabetes, and malignancies,
which are more prevalent in older populations, as common comorbidities among CU patients in the present study.

There were some limitations to the use of HIRA data in this
study, even though the database provides a wealth of information on demographics and treatment patterns of CU in Korea.
Since no specific disease code for CU is available and since
both over-the-counter drugs and herbal medicines were not
registered in the present study, a confirmatory medical record
analysis of CU patients is needed to obtain accurate estimates
of the prevalence and disease burden of CU in Korea. In addi

tion, a possible discordance between drug claims and active
urticaria symptoms might distort real medication patterns of
CU in the HIRA database.

In conclusion, we have outlined the epidemiology of CU in
Korea using a nationwide database. The prevalence of CU in
this study was similar to that in the literature for other countries. However, we were able to shed light on more frequent use
of systemic corticosteroids, a relatively shorter duration of prescription antihistamines, and a higher frequency of gastrointestinal comorbidity, compared with other countries. Thus, to support physicians in the management of urticaria, development
of appropriate treatment guidelines may be needed.
