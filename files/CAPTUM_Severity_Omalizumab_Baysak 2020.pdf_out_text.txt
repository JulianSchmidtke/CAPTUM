Long-term follow-up effect of omalizumab in chronic spontaneous urticaria and its association with
serum C-reactive protein levels

Abstract

This study aims to determine the efficacy of omalizumab, a humanized monoclonal anti-immunoglobulin E
antibody, in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) refractory to conventional therapy, together
with the evaluation of serum CRP levels. All the patients with a diagnosis of CSU who were continuously
treated with omalizumab (300 mg/month) for at least 3 months between June 2016 and July 2019 were
included in this study. Urticaria activity score (UAS-7) was used for assessment of disease activity. Serum
CRP levels were also retrospectively analyzed. When UAS-7 scores before the initiation of therapy were
compared to the week 4, 12, 24 and 36 scores after the treatment, each were significantly different from the
pretreatment results. (p< .01) CRP level prior to treatment was found to be strongly correlated with baseline
UAS scores of the patients’ (p:0,00). At the 12th week of treatment, decline of CRP level was positively
and strongly correlated with the decline of UAS (p:0.037). In this study, mean UAS decreased, mean rescue
medication use declined, and overall therapeutic response improved with omalizumab treatment.
Additionally, significant correlation between the decline of CRP levels and treatment response was found.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is defined as the presence of spontaneously occurring wheals, flares
and/or angioedema with no identifiable trigger, for longer than 6 weeks. Estimated lifetime prevalence of
CSU is 0.5% to 1.0%, with a female predominance (2:1) and a peak incidence between the ages of 20 and
40 (Powell et al., 2007).

Patients with CSU may be suffering from psychological and emotional distress, anxiety and overall
decreased quality of life. According to some studies in the literature, patients with CSU suffer similar quality
of life impairment to patients with severe coronary artery disease waiting for bypass surgery (Saini et al.,
2015).

Despite various therapy options, chronic course of the disease may last months to years, leading to
consequential disabilities. The recommended first-line treatment is non-sedating H1-blocking
antihistamines, with doses up to 4 times the recommended pharmacologic dose. Recent urticaria
guidelines (Zuberbier et al., 2018) recommend adding on omalizumab as a second-line agent for
the treatment of patients unresponsive to 2nd-generation H1-antihistamines. It was decided that
omalizumab should be tried before ciclosporin A due to worse profile of adverse effects.

Other therapy options include leukotriene antagonists, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate and systemic
corticosteroids in case of acute exacerbations. Nevertheless, long term use of these agents may not be
feasible, due to low patient compliance and potential side-effects (Sussman et al., 2014). The high number
of still symptomatic patients explains the need for third-line treatment options. Omalizumab, a humanized
monoclonal anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody, has become the drug of choice for the management of
chronic urticaria, according to evidence gathered for the past years via case reports and randomized clinical
trials (Kaplan et al., 2013; Lefévre et al., 2013; Maurer et al., 2013). Very thorough placebo-controlled
clinical trials (ASTERIA I, Il and GLACIAL) have shown clear improvement of CSU in real-life experience
with omalizumab (Kaplan et al., 2013; Maurer et al., 2013; Saini et al., 2015). Omalizumab is currently
approved in CSU, but has also been used in many types of chronic inducible urticaria. The mechanism of
action of omalizumab in chronic urticaria is still unknown. One possible way of action is the downregulation
of IgE receptors on mast cells and basophils (Song et al., 2013). Data on the use of omalizumab has
improved our understanding that treatment acts on many levels, including regulating levels of inflammatory
proteins, including various cytokines and C-reactive protein (CRP). For CSU, assessment of disease activity
and treatment efficacy is purely clinical and assessed by subjective tools. Recently, several reports have
suggested that blood parameters such as CRP may indicate disease activity and duration while monitoring
treatment and may be considered as potential prognostic biomarkers of CSU.

Main objective of this retrospective study is to describe the clinical characteristics of CSU patients treated
with omalizumab at our Dermatology Department and determine the efficacy of omalizumab in patients
refractory to conventional therapy, with assessment of long-term safety and possible side-effects while
evaluating the levels of serum CRP with regard to response of therapy.

Materials and Methods

This is a retrospective chart-review study of patients with a diagnosis of severe, refractory CSU treated with
omalizumab from June 2016 to July 2019 in Sultan 2. Abdulhamid Han Training and Research Hospital,
Universtiy of Medical Sciences, Dermatology and Venereology Department. Patient population in this trial
were unresponsive to maximal doses of oral antihistamines and often required repeated administration of
systemic glucocorticoids to achieve disease control.

Main objective of this study was to evaluate omalizumab, at a dose of 300 mg/month, in severe and
refractory cases of chronic urticaria, by assessing the impact on clinical severity, time to induce remission,
and dose schedule necessary to induce and sustain long-term remission.

All the patients with a diagnosis of CSU who were initiated and continuously treated with omalizumab for
at least 3 months between June 2016 and July 2019 were included in this study. Three months-time limit
was determined in order to accurately evaluate patient’s response to therapy and, thus, to make the decision
to continue or stop the treatment. Patients were treated with subcutaneous omalizumab, with a dose of 300
mg every 4 weeks at the outpatient clinic under surveillance.

Urticaria activity score (UAS-7) was used for assessment of disease activity in all patients. It was calculated
as recommended by EAACI/GALEN/EDF/WAO Guidelines (Zuberbier et al., 2018). UAS-7 measurements
were taken at baseline and at each visit before omalizumab administration, in order to assess the patient
response and therapeutic efficacy. The UAS-7 is a validated tool used to assess urticaria severity (Ghazanfar
et al., 2018; Mtynek et al., 2008). The scores of the patient are assessed by the numbers of hives (none:0
point; <10 per day:1 point; 10-50 per day:2 points; >50 per day:3 points) and the intensity of pruritus (none:0
point; mild:1 point; moderate:2 points; severe:3 points) each day for 7 days and reaching a maximum total
score of 42 points. Time to remission and the dosing interval required to maintain remission were
documented. Complete remission was defined as complete absence of urticarial lesions and pruritus (UAS7 0). Sociodemographic data of the patient group and disease duration, as well as concomitant medication
use were recorded. Serum CRP levels were also retrospectively analyzed and patients with systemic
comorbidities which may influence the level of CRP, are excluded from the study group. Adverse effects
were monitored and recorded after each omalizumab administration for immediate and late reactions.

Statistical analyses of the data were performed using SPSS software version 22.0 (IBM, 2013). Chi-square,
Mann-Whitney U and repeated measures ANOVA tests were used for comparing variables. A p value <
0.05 was considered significant. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Review Board of
University of Medical Sciences, Haydarpasa Numune Training and Research Hospital.

Results

In total 147 patients were initiated treatment with omalizumab for CSU from June 2016 to July 2019.
Twenty-eight patients (19%) were excluded due to missing baseline data and/or due to having concomitant
systemic inflammatory disorders such as collagen tissue disorders, active infections and malignancy which
may have interfered with the results of CRP levels.

Study subjects had various degrees of urticarial symptoms for periods ranging from 4 months to 9,9 years.
None had satisfactory response to maximal dose of antihistamines or other therapy options. Seventy-two
percent of the patients were women (86 of 119) and the mean age was 40.86 + 13.59 years (Male: 41.85 +
13.17, Female: 38.30 + 14.57). The mean age of urticaria onset was 38 + 16 years. Mean disease duration
was 25,42 months (range 4-119 months). Seventeen percent (n=21) had a history of angioedema and of all
the patients.

Atopic comorbidities in CSU patients were present in 21 patients (18 %); 12 (10%) had asthma and/or
allergic rhinitis, 7 (6%) had drug allergy and 2 (2%) had food allergy.

All patients with CSU had been treated previously with H1-blocking antihistamines and in our cohort, the
most frequently used antihistamine was levocetirizine, at doses up to 20 mg/day. Other antihistamines, such
as cetirizine, hydroxyzine, or desloratadine, were used. Before the initiation of omalizumab, 65 of 119
patients (54,6%) had been prescribed systemic corticosteroids with variable dosages and mostly on an asneeded basis.

All the patients in the study group received a dose of 300 mg omalizumab monthly. For 8 patients (7%),
treatment intervals were prolonged from every 4 weeks to every 6 weeks and further to every 8 weeks. For
3 patients (2,5%), intervals were prolonged to every 12 weeks. Number of treatment sessions ranged from
3 to 12, with a mean follow-up time of 9,7 months. The duration of follow-up was 3 months for 7 patients
(6%) 3 months to 6 months for 33 patients (27,7%), 6 months or longer for 79 patients (66,3%)

After the initiation of omalizumab therapy, no patient required systemic corticosteroids. During the
omalizumab treatment 83 (69,7%) of the patients continued daily oral antihistamines as an add-on therapy
and 9 (7,5%) were medicated with leukotriene antagonists due to respiratory atopic comorbidities.

[Insert Figure 1.]

Omalizumab treatment was significantly effective regarding the reduction of urticaria activity. Mean UAS7 scores of the patients in the pretreatment phase was 28,8, while at the 4" week it was decreased to 9,79
and 8,45 at week 12, 7,90 at week 24, 6,76 at week 36 and 6,43 at week 48. A statistically significant
reduction in UAS scores was observed by week 4, and mean UAS continued to decline through week 24 (P
< 0.000) (Figure 1.) ANOVA test results about the UAS-7 scores of patients before and after treatment are
shown in Table 1. Pretreatment and post-treatment UAS-7 scores were found to be significantly different.
(F=163. 783, p < 0.01) When scores before the initiation of therapy were compared to the week 4, 12, 24
and 36 scores after the treatment, each were significantly different from the pretreatment results. (p< .01)

UAS reduction during the first 12 weeks were more prominent than the reduction between 12-24 weeks and
this difference was statistically significant (p:0,00). Improvement of the UAS scores of the patients’ seemed
to be less between 12-24 weeks, when compared to 24-36 weeks but the difference was insignificant
(p=0,372).

[Insert Table 1.]

When we further investigate the difference of UAS7 scores of consecutive weeks, no significant difference
between week 4-12 (p=0.35), 12-24 (p=1), 24-36 (p=1) and 36-48 (p=0.37) were found. On the other hand,
in case of long-term follow-up, difference of UAS7 scores between weeks 4-48 (p< .01) and 12-48 (p< .034)
were statistically significant. (Table 2)

[Insert Table 2.]

During the first 12 weeks, UAS reduction rates were similar for the patients using omalizumab plus
antihistamines and omalizumab alone (p=0,258). However at the 24'" week, decrease in average UAS levels
was more prominent for the patients who were using the combination of omalizumab and antihistamines.
(p=0.00)

Twelve weeks after the initiation of omalizumab therapy, 45 out of 119 patients (37,8%) had controlled
urticaria, with UAS < 6 while under combination therapy of omalizumab and oral antihistamines. These
group of patients were classified as partial responders. During omalizumab treatment, some of these patients
were using antihistamines daily while others used them only during flare-ups. Whereas 29 patients (24%)
were complete responders, reaching UAS < 6 and without the need of any medication other than
omalizumab. By the end of the study, omalizumab treatment was stopped in 21 patients (17,6%), and longlasting remission was achieved without any relapses after discontinuation of the drug. This group is also
classified as complete responders without depending on omalizumab. Time from the last omalizumab dose
was a minimum of 8 weeks and a maximum of 18 months for these patients.

To sum up, a total of 74 patients (62%) achieved a UAS score of 6 or less at 3 months follow-up, indicating
minimal disease activity; 28 patients (23,5%) achieved a UAS score of 0 at 3 months follow-up, while 46
patients (38,5%) reported a UAS score between | and 6 points.

At the end of 12 weeks, patients with a UAS of greater than 6, despite concomitant use of 300 mg/month
omalizumab and maximal dose antihistamines were regarded as non-responders. 45 patients (37,8%)
continued experiencing symptoms of urticaria and could not achieve UAS < 6 despite afore-mentioned
therapy and were classified as non-responders. Omalizumab therapy was discontinued after 24 months. 98
CSU patients (82,3%) were still on omalizumab by the end of this study.

Following patient-related factors were not found to be associated with UAS7 score at baseline or with the
response rates for omalizumab therapy: sex, age, age of onset of CSU, symptom duration, history of
angioedema, comorbidities, previous treatment with prednisolone or montelukast. (p > 0.05 for all
comparisons).

CRP level prior to treatment was found to be strongly correlated with baseline UAS scores of the patients’.
(p=0,00, Pearson correlation coefficient: 0,773). Moreover, at the 12" week of the omalizumab treatment,
the decline of CRP level was positively and strongly correlated with the decline of UAS, thus treatment
response. (p=0.037) (Table-1) On the other hand, baseline CRP levels before the initiation of therapy were
not correlated with treatment response at 12" or 24" week. (p=0,453) High initial CRP levels were not
associated with a higher decline in UAS and thus, better response to omalizumab therapy. Omalizumab was
well-tolerated in all patients and apart from temporary injection-site reactions, no serious immediate or late
adverse events were reported during the study.

Discussion

Treatment of chronic urticaria is particularly difficult, and the mainstays of initial therapy include nonsedating antihistamines with the possible addition of H2-blockers and leukotriene pathway inhibitors.
However, a substantial proportion of patients remain poorly responsive to these agents, as well as second
line options such as corticosteroids or ciclosporine, with numerous side effects.

The term “autoallergy”, which is now considered as the main cause for urticaria, refers to a type I,
IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction against self-antigens which can, in turn, promote
degranulation of basophils and mast cells. Approximately half of the patients with chronic urticaria is
thought to have an autoimmune etiology in which there is IgG antibody directed to the a-subunit of the highaffinity IgE receptor or to IgE itself (Kaplan et al., 2013). This autoantibody cross-links the a-subunits and
degranulates basophils and cutaneous mast cells in this group of patients, causing more severe symptoms
when compared to patients without such autoantibodies (Sabroe et al., 2002). By binding and decreasing
circulating IgE levels, omalizumab will secondarily decrease the IgE receptor density on basophils and
cutaneous mast cells, preventing activation by autoantibodies. Since 2014, omalizumab has been used as
add-on therapy for CSU in patients older than 12 years of age. The drug is rather new and little is known
about the long-term effects and there is no consensus regarding duration of treatment.

All patients in our cohort were treated with 300 mg subcutaneous omalizumab for every 4 weeks, as in most
other studies in the literature. However, there are also different approaches, according to G. Sussman et al,
even in the setting of severe disease, a 150-mg dose of omalizumab was found to be sufficient to induce
complete remission (Sussman et al., 2014).

The most dramatic effect was observed within the first three months of the treatment period, which can give
physician a hint about the omalizumab-resistant group of patients, if there is not enough decrease in UAS
during the first three months. Although the decrease of UAS is most prominent during the first three months,
the scores of the patients continued to decrease throughout the course of the therapy.

Generalized linear models were applied to study the progression of the urticaria activity score in response
to omalizumab. Although the patients were simultaneously weaning off concomitant drugs such as
corticosteroids, 27% reduction of UAS per omalizumab administration was obtained, with statistical
significance (p < 0.001). A key clinical feature is the type of response. With 62% of complete or partial
responders, success rate of omalizumab treatment in our series was similar to other retrospective studies in
the literature. A study from Spain, in which the UAS was used to assess disease activity, found a significant
reduction in the mean UAS in a subgroup of 38 patients, from 5.34 + 0.88 before treatment to 0.66 + 1.3
after 3 months (Labrador-Horrillo et al., 2013). Similarly, Wilches et al found that 77 % of patients had a
complete or partial response after treatment with omalizumab for 3 months (Wilches et al., 2016) and a
recent study reported that 60 % of patients responded when started on the same doses (Ensina et al., 2016).

The use of concomitant medication significantly decreased in different patient groups on omalizumab
treatment. In a study about the efficacy of the drug, 60% of patients were able to withdraw all medications
using omalizumab (Labrador-Horrillo et al., 2013). In our cohort, remarkable clinical response was also
accompanied by decrease in use of concomitant therapies, including antihistamines and glucocorticoids. In

agreement with other studies (Casale et al., 2015; Kaplan et al., 2016; Silva et al., 2015), prior to omalizumab
treatment, 55% of our patient group used systemic corticosteroids for on-demand basis, and none of them
had any requirement after the first dose of omalizumab treatment. Similarly, 24% of the patients were
symptom free without the concomitant use of antihistamines or other medications. Significant clinical
responses to omalizumab in chronic urticaria have been reported previously, but usually with smaller cohorts
and patients with milder symptoms of urticaria (Sussman et al., 2014).

Of those complete and partial responders, 18% remain symptom free after omalizumab was discontinued.
Therefore, discontinuation should always be tried as successful remission is possible. For the patients in our
study cohort who achieved remission free of omalizumab, average treatment duration was 21 months.
Another important finding in our cohort, also shown by Metz et al (Metz et al., 2014) and Marcelino et al
(Marcelino et al., 2018) is that there is no decrease in the effect of omalizumab when reinitiating after it has
been discontinued.

Thirty-seven percent of patients in our study group were non-responders, which was similar to previous data
reported by Har et al (Har et al., 2015) and Savic et al (Savic et al., 2015) but higher than some other studies
(Marcelino et al., 2018; Silva et al., 2015). Overall, approximately 41-48% of patients in clinical trials
(Kaplan et al., 2013; Maurer et al., 2013; Saini et al., 2015) and 12-23% in “real-world clinical setting”
(Deza et al.; Ertas et al., 2017; Gericke et al., 2017; Labrador-Horrillo et al., 2013; Metz et al., 2014; Rottem
et al., 2014) do not have a complete or significant response to omalizumab therapy. However, there are also
some studies of omalizumab in the literature without any non-responder patients (Marcelino et al., 2018).
Relatively high percentage of non-responders in our cohort may be due to high number of patients and,
being more resistant to various therapy options which are usually referred to our tertiary research center.

In accordance with previous studies, the authors concur that the 6-month time limit is arbitrary, for the
decision of response to therapy. With regard to the data about late responders to omalizumab, who only
respond after several months of therapy (Gericke et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2016), patients of this cohort were
also given a minimum of 6 months of omalizumab therapy before cessation due to resistance. The percentage
of non-responding patients in clinical trials was calculated after 12 to 24 weeks of omalizumab. Similarly,
we classified our patients as non-responders only after 6 months of omalizumab therapy was given without
any success, so that some of the late responders would not be incorrectly classified as non-responders.

In our study, patients were on omalizumab for up to 25 months with no apparent side-effects or loss of
efficacy. Its good safety profile has been shown in various studies, with a recent meta-analysis of
randomized clinical trials showing a similar rate of adverse events in the omalizumab and placebo groups
with the long-term use (Metz et al., 2014; Silva et al., 2015). These results are comparable to the findings
by Savic et al (Savic et al., 2015) who reported 36 adverse events (involving 37% of the patients), most of
which were skin reactions.

Omalizumab is an expensive therapy option and thus many studies in the literature patients are responsible
for the costs of therapy. This eventually leads to enrollment of fewer patients or early cessation of therapy.
However, in our country, all costs of omalizumab therapy are funded by the government throughout the
whole course of therapy. Thus, in our cohort, patients were observed for a longer period than in most other
reported studies (up to 25 months) At the end of our study period, 98 patients were still on omalizumab

therapy, which allows the investigation of long-term safety and efficacy of the drug. The sustained efficacy
and lack of serious adverse events during this period are encouraging observations for omalizumab therapy
and provide further support for long-term use of this intervention.

CRP is a sensitive marker that may be increased in CSU due to mast cell activation accompanied by a
significant increase in the cardiovascular risk and may induce or enhance inflammatory response (Grzanka
et al., 2015). CRP exerts immunoregulatory functions including enhancement of leukocyte activity,
modulation of platelet activation and clearance of cellular debris from sites of active inflammation. In this
study, change in levels of CRP with omalizumab treatment and its relevance with response rates were
evaluated. Among all of analyzed acute phase proteins, only the serum concentration of CRP was increased
in all types of urticaria, according to multiple analysis in the literature (Kasperska-Zajac et al., 2013; Alicja
Kasperska-Zajac et al., 2013; A Kasperska-Zajac et al., 2011). It has also been proved that higher levels of
some acute phase proteins such as CRP are thought to be associated with a severe course of the disease with
higher number and size of urticarial wheals (A Kasperska-Zajac, 2012; A Kasperska-Zajac et al., 2011). Our
study population also supports this data, with increased level of baseline CRP in patients with higher UAS7. However, the problem remains as to whether it is specific enough for urticaria, as it can be elevated in
many other diseases that are often comorbid in patients with CSU or even an underlying cause of CSU (e.g.
chronic infections, autoimmune disorders). During retrospective analysis of our cohort, 28 patients with
such comorbidities which may possibly cause elevated levels of CRP, were excluded.

Initial levels of CRP in our study group were significantly correlated with the severity of urticaria.
Additionally, a statistically significant decrease in CRP levels at 12" week of omalizumab treatment in
correlation with a decrease in UAS has been found, which may indicate the anti-inflammatory effect of
omalizumab. This finding is consistent with a similar study in the literature about the decrease in both
neutrophil count and CRP level with omalizumab treatment in urticaria patients (Acer et al., 2019). High
levels of baseline CRP is also found to be associated with omalizumab resistance, besides other factors like
obesity, hypertension and high plasma C3 levels (Magen et al., 2019), nevertheless, we could not find such
a correlation. On the other hand, Lin et al. found a negative correlation between CRP levels and the extent
of erythema in urticarial plaques (Lin et al., 2001).

Nonetheless, we could not find an association between initial levels of CRP and UAS decline rates, thus as
far as our study is concerned, CRP can not be used as a predictive tool for response rates during omalizumab
therapy in CSU. Although baseline CRP levels in CSU patients do not reflect future treatment response
rates, CRP may be a useful biomarker for patient follow-up, together with UAS.

Levels of other various biomarkers have also been studied related to omalizumab treatment, such as total
IgE, D-dimer, tryptase, ECP, IL-1b, IL 31, CXCL8 and 25- hydroxyvitamin D (Altrichter et al., 2016; Yalcin
et al., 2013) or some blood parameters such as white blood cell count, platelet count or MPV (Akelma et al.,
2015), all showing the inhibitory effects of omalizumab on inflammation cascades. Besides CRP levels,
plasma fibrin degradation products and d-dimer levels were also well correlated with each other and
significantly associated with disease severity in urticaria (Takahagi et al., 2010).

Limitation

The main limitation of this study is the retrospective design. Further prospective studies are warranted in
order to evaluate the effect of omalizumab on hematological and inflammatory parameters and correlation
between response rate of omalizumab and these parameters, as well as long-term effects and side-effects of
omalizumab in CSU patients.

Conclusion

In this study, mean UAS decreased, mean rescue medication use declined, and overall therapeutic response
improved. These results about the outcome measures demonstrate the potency of the study and add to the
growing evidence base in support of the use of omalizumab for chronic and recalcitrant urticaria. The
compelling data from research with omalizumab, show that many of these previously difficult-to-treat
patients can achieve complete, sustained responses while being spared from the side-effects associated with
oral glucocorticoids.

Additionally, significant correlation which is observed in this study between the acute-phase proteins
concentration in the serum and clinical activity score of urticaria point to the potential role of these proteins
as markers of the disease activity. Estimation of acute phase reaction biomarker levels in the serum may
serve as a useful tool in diagnosing and monitoring the activity of urticaria and its response to treatment.
