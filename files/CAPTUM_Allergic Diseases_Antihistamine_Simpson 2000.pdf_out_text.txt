Summary
Abstract Fexofenadine, the active metabolite of terfenadine, is a selective histamine H1

receptor antagonist that does not cross the blood brain barrier and appears to
display some anti-inflammatory properties. Fexofenadine is rapidly absorbed
(onset of relief ~2 hours) and has a long duration of action, making it suitable for
once daily administration.

Clinical trials (<2 weeks’ duration) have shown fexofenadine 60mg twice
daily and 120mg once daily to be as effective as loratadine 10mg once daily, and
fexofenadine 120mg once daily to be as effective as cetirizine 10mg once daily
in the overall reduction of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis. When given in
combination, fexofenadine and extended release pseudoephedrine had complementary activity. Fexofenadine was effective in relieving the symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhoea, itchy nose, palate or throat, and itchy, watery, red eyes in
patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. There were often small improvements in
nasal congestion that were further improved by pseudoephedrine. Fexofenadine
produced greater improvements in quality of life than loratadine to an extent
considered to be clinically meaningful, and enhanced patients’ qualty of life when
added to pseudoephedrine treatment. Although no comparative data with other
Hi antagonists exist, fexofenadine 180mg once daily was effective in reducing
the symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria for up to 6 weeks.

Fexofenadine was well tolerated in clinical trials in adults and adolescents an
the adverse event profile was similar to placebo in all studies. The most frequently
reported adverse event during fexofenadine treatment was headache, which occurred with a similar incidence to that seen in placebo recipients. Fexofenadine
does not inhibit cardiac K+ channels and is not associated with prolongation o:
the corrected QT interval. When given alone or in combination with erythromycin
or ketoconazole, it was not associated with any adverse cardiac events in clinica
trials. As it does not cross the blood brain barrier, fexofenadine is free of the
sedative effects associated with first generation antihistamines, even at dosages
of up to 240 mg/day.

Conclusions: fexofenadine is clinically effective in the treatment of seasona
allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria for which it is a suitable option
for first-line therapy. Comparative data suggest that fexofenadine is as effective
as loratadine or cetirizine in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. In those
with excessive nasal congestion the combination of fexofenadine plus pseudoephedrine may be useful. In clinical trials fexofenadine is not associated with
adverse cardiac or cognitive/psychomotor effects.

and terfenadine were more effective than lower doses. However, the onset of action
of fexofenadine (<2 hours) was faster than that of loratadine.

Jn vitro, concentrations of the drug close to those achieved at clinical dosages
have been shown to attenuate the release of many inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, leukotrienes and adhesion molecules, from a variety of cell
types.

Dosages <120mg rapidly (after a median of 60 min) relieved allergen-induced
symptoms in ragweed sensitive volunteers in a randomised, double-blind study.
In addition, the drug was as effective as terfenadine at relieving nasal pruritus
and congestion, and better at controlling rhinorrhoea and sneezing after nasal
provocation tests with allergen in patients with grass pollen-induced rhinitis. A
higher allergen concentration was required to provoke a response after fexofenadine than terfenadine.

In animal models of corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation, fexofenadine
did not prolong QT, or decrease heart rate, unlike terfenadine, astemizole and
ebastine. Indeed, fexofenadine has a relatively weak affinity for cloned human
cardiac potassium channels compared with other antihistamines.

During development, fexofenadine was shown to have no significant effects
on heart rate, PR interval, QRS width, QT interval or QT; and to cause no adverse
cardiovascular events at single doses up to 800mg and multiple dosages up to 690
mg/day.

Fexofenadine is rapidly absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentrations approximately 1.0 to 1.5 hours after single doses of oral solution (20 to 240mg) and has
a long duration of action (t!, =14 hours). It does not appear to cross the blood
brain barrier. There is minimal systemic metabolism (<5%) or accumulation. The
drug is predominately excreted in the faeces as unchanged drug. The pharmacokinetic properties of fexofenadine are similar after single and multiple doses and
are dose proportional over a range of 10 to 800mg.

Elimination of fexofenadine is decreased in patients with renal impairment.
However, mild to severe hepatic impairment did not appreciably affect its pharmacokinetic properties.

Coadministration of erythromycin or ketoconazole resulted in increases in
steady state fexofenadine plasma concentrations, but these remained within the
range achieved in clinical trials of the drug and QT; intervals were unchanged.

In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, 2 weeks’ treatment with fexofenadine
once (120 or 180mg) or twice (40 to 240mg) daily produced significantly (p <
0.01) greater improvements in total symptom score (TSS) than placebo. The
effects of the drug persisted for up to 24 hours. Nasal congestion, which was not
included in the TSS, was generally reduced by dosages 2120 mg/day. With respect to improving TSS, fexofenadine 60mg twice daily and 120mg once daily
was as effective as loratadine 10mg once daily and fexofenadine 120mg once
daily was as effective as cetirizine 10mg once daily after 7 to 14 days’ treatment
(p < 0.05 vs placebo for all). Individual symptom scores (including sneezing,
rhinorrhoea, itchy nose, palate or throat, and itchy, watery, red eyes) were similarly improved by fexofenadine and loratadine, except itchy, watery, red eyes,
which only significantly improved with fexofenadine.

Fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine had complementary activity in patients
with ragweed-induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Importantly, nasal congestion
scores improved more with the combination than with fexofenadine alone.

Dosage and
Administration

Simpson & Jarvis

In patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, fexofenadine dosages 240 mg/day
for 4 or 6 weeks produced improvements in TSS compared with placebo but
higher dosages tended to have greater efficacy.

Fexofenadine improved quality of life and decreased work and activity impairment in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, the drug produced greater
improvements in quality of life than loratadine to an extent considered to be
clinically meaningful, and enhanced patients’ quality of life when added to pseudoephedrine treatment.

Fexofenadine (<240 mg/day for up to 6 weeks and <480 mg/day for up to 4 weeks)
was well tolerated in clinical trials in adults and adolescents (aged 212 years)
with seasonal allergic rhinitis or chronic idiopathic urticaria, and in children aged
6 to 11 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis. The drug was also well tolerated in
2 long term trials with dosages of 60mg twice daily for 6 months and 240mg once
daily for 12 months. The incidence of treatment-related adverse events associated
with fexofenadine was similar to those of placebo, loratadine and cetirizine, and
lower than that associated with pseudoephedrine. Headache was the most frequently reported adverse event during treatment, which occurred with a similar
incidence to that seen in placebo recipients.

No adverse electrocardiographic events or episodes of torsades de pointes
occurred during randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials with fexofenadine.

In short and long term (2-week to

 

2-month) studies with dosages <240mg twice

daily, there were no significant increases in QT

dition, there was no increase in QT¢ when the

[¢ compared with placebo. In addrug was administered in combi
nation with erythromycin or ketoconazole.

In comparison with placebo, fexofenadine did not increase the incidence of
sedation or drowsiness and did not impair cognitive or psychomotor function,
even at dosages exceeding those recommended (up to 240 mg/day).

 

In the US, the recommended dosage of fexofenadine for the treatment of seasonal
allergic rhinitis is 60mg twice daily, alone or in combination with pseudoephedrine 120mg, for adults and adolescents aged >12 years. In the UK, the recommended dosage of fexofenadine for relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic
rhinitis is 120mg once daily and the recommended dosage for the treatment of
chronic idiopathic urticaria is 1 80mg once daily. For patients with decreased renal
function or those on haemodialysis a lower starting dosage of 60mg once daily
is recommended in the US, but not in the UK. Dosage adjustment is not necessary
in elderly patients or those with hepatic impairment.

such as sneezing, itching, watery eyes and rhinorrhoea.”! During the late phase, the inflammatory
response is perpetuated further with the development of hypersecretion and congestion.!°!

The term urticaria describes a skin lesion that is
typically an erythematous, raised plaque with a
regular or irregular border and sometimes a
blanched area in its centre.!7] Urticaria is usually of
short duration (<6 weeks) but can become
chronic.!7] Chronic episodes can be debilitating
and can affect patients’ quality of life. Often an
external cause for chronic urticaria is hard to identify; although allergy and infection may sometimes
be implicated in acute urticaria, they are not usually involved in chronic urticaria.!°! The late phase
reaction in urticaria consists of a burning sensation, pruritus, erythema and induration that peak at
6 to 8 hours and usually resolve by 24 to 48
hours.) Angioedema, considered part of the same
disease process as urticaria, often occurs in the
deeper dermal tissues.!®] Angioedema usually presents as a nondemarcated swelling of the skin.!*!
Swellings are not itchy and disappear within 24 to
72 hours but may recur on a chronic basis.'°] The
characteristic wheals of urticaria occur when histamine causes the endothelial cells of capillary
blood vessels to retract, allowing fluid to leak out
of the vessels into the surrounding tissues.!7]

Fexofenadine is a selective histamine H, receptor

and has been termed a 3rd generation antihistamine.!] Third generation anithistamines (including fexofenadine, norastemizole and descarboethoxy loratadine) are therapeutically active
metabolites that are devoid of cardiac toxicity, unlike certain 2nd generation antihistamines (e.g. terfenadine and astemizole).'! In addition, they also

2. Pharmacodynamic Properties

2.1 Anti-Histaminic Properties

Fexofenadine is a histamine H, receptor antagonist. The drug attenuated bronchospasm in

50% (EDs0) = 0.08 mg/kg].!"") No anticholinergic
or anti-0-adrenergic activity was observed in laboratory animals exposed to the drug (dosage not
specified).!!7]

twice daily was significantly more effective than
fexofenadine 60mg twice daily (p < 0.001) [mean

59.23% by fexofenadine and terfenadine, respectively] in a double-blind, crossover study.!9] In a

fexofenadine 180mg, significantly reduced histamine-induced wheal reactions from baseline
within | hour of administration in 10 volunteers
(from 32.1 to 11.0mm2, p < 0.05 and from 25.3 to
27.6mm?, respectively).(2°]

2.2 Anti-Inflammatory Properties

The inflammatory reaction triggered by mast
cell degranulation involves a number of soluble
and cell surface molecules, including cytokines,
leukotrienes and adhesion molecules." Fexofenadine has been shown in vitro to attenuate the release of many of these mediators from a variety of
cell types (e.g. epithelial, fibroblast, basophils and
mast cells) at concentrations close to those
achieved at clinical dosages [table I]. There have
been no studies comparing the anti-inflammatory
properties of fexofenadine with other antihistamines, such as cetirizine and loratadine, which
have also displayed anti-inflammatory characteristics.b1

2.3 Efficacy in Individuals with
Induced Allergies

Fexofenadine rapidly relieved allergen-induced
symptoms in ragweed sensitive volunteers in a
randomised, double-blind study.6" Participants
were exposed to controlled pollen levels for 60
minutes in an environmental exposure unit before
treatment with fexofenadine 60 (n = 33) or 120mg
(n = 33) or placebo (n = 33), after which they were
monitored for 5 hours. The median time to onset of
clinically meaningful relief (self-assessment of
‘slight’ to ‘complete’ relief for 260 minutes) was
60 minutes for either dose of fexofenadine and 100
minutes for placebo (p = 0.018). Significantly more
fexofenadine than placebo recipients experienced
relief (282 vs 64%; p < 0.05).b]

Fexofenadine was as effective as terfenadine at
relieving nasal pruritus (patient assessed) and nasal
congestion (assessed by peak nasal inspiratory
flow and mean cross-sectional area of the nostrils
measured by acoustic rhinometry), and better at
controlling rhinorrhoea (p = 0.008) and sneezing
(significance level not stated) in 25 patients with
grass pollen-induced rhinitis.57! Nasal provocation
tests with allergen were performed 2 hours after a
single dose of fexofenadine or terfenadine
120mg.©?] Treatment with both drugs allowed a
significant (p < 0.001 vs baseline) increase in the
dose of allergen required to provoke a response, but
the number of shifts in allergen concentration was
significantly greater after fexofenadine than after
terfenadine (1 shift 36 vs 24% of patients, 2 shifts
20 vs 16% and 3+ shifts 32 vs 16%; p = 0.033 between treatments).[>2]

In 5 atopic individuals, neither agent reduced
the wheal reactions induced by allergen prick test
within 1 hour.°] In a double-blind study in 12
highly allergic volunteers, fexofenadine reduced
both the early and late cutaneous responses produced by intradermal injection of allergen.?!

2.4 Potential for Cardiotoxicity

In guinea-pig models of corrected QT interval
(QT.) prolongation, fexofenadine did not prolong
QT, or decrease heart rate, unlike terfenadine,
astemizole and ebastine (table I).2°) Similar results
were obtained in studies in rabbits and dogs which
compared fexofenadine and terfenadine (table
1).281 Prolongation of QT, occurs through blockade
of K* rectifier channels in ventricular myocytes,
leading to a delay in ventricular repolarisation;
fexofenadine does not appear to block this channel.[26.29.34.35] Indeed, fexofenadine demonstrates a
relatively weak effect on a variety of cloned human
cardiac potassium channels compared with other
antihistamines (e.g. terfenadine).|?81

During development, fexofenadine was shown
to have no significant effects on heart rate, PR interval, QRS width, QT interval or QT,, and to have
no adverse cardiovascular effects.!?°) These results
are examined in more detail in section 5.1. Clinical

Fexofenadine (50 tg/ml) inhibited (p < 0.05) the spontaneous release of IL-6 from a fibroblast cell line (HEL cells)"
The immunologic release of histamine and LTC, from human basophils, in response to antigen (Der p |) or anti-IgE

Anti-IgE-induced histamine and LTC, release from human mast cells purified from lung parenchyma (HLMC) was
inhibited (10 to 40%) by fexofenadine (10 to 10° mol/L)

In vivo studies in animal models
Anti-allergic In a murine model of allergic sensitisation (involving BALB/c mice), fexofenadine (2.5mg bid) significantly reduced
properties early and late phase allergic reactions to allergen challenge, and decreased numbers of tissue eosinophils and
levels of eosinophil peroxidase in BAL fluid!5)
Pretreatment with fexofenadine (2.5mg bid) also significantly reduced airway responsiveness to metacholine in the
above modell5]
In a guinea-pig model, fexofenadine (100 mg/kg) did not cause adverse cardiac events, unlike terfenadine,
astemizole and ebastine, which dose-dependently prolonged QT; (significant at intravenous doses 23, >1 and >10
mg/kg, respectively; p < 0.05) and decreased heart rate!'1:26)
Like fexofenadine, loratadine (100 mg/kg) and cetirizine (20 mg/kg) were devoid of adverse cardiac effects in
guinea-pig models!1:271
In anaethetised rabbits, fexofenadine 3 and 10 mg/kg/h (1h intravenous infusion) demonstrated no effect on QTc,
whereas terfenadine 1 mg/kg/h (1h intravenous infusion) significantly increased QT.[12]
After 5 days in conscious, normotensive dogs, oral fexofenadine 3 and 10 mg/kg bid had no effect on QTc, whereas
a 30 mg/kg bid dosage decreased QT, by 15 msec. In contrast, terfenadine 3 and 10 mg/kg bid significantly
increased QT, by 7 (2%) and 21-28 (10%) msec, respectively!'2]
The ICs50 of fexofenadine in HERG, Kv4.3 and Kv1.5 cloned human cardiac potassium channels was 23, 112 and
214 umol/L, respectively, compared with terfenadine which had ICso values of 0.056, 3 and 0.367 umol/L?®)
The ICs0 of fexofenadine in rapidly activating delayed rectifier channels (fHK) cloned from human heart (expressed
in human embryonic kidney cells) was 583-fold greater than that for terfenadine!9l

maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) increased
in proportion to dose, whereas clearance and elimination half-life (t,,) remained constant.38:39

3.1 Pharmacokinetic Properties in Special
Patient Groups

Elimination of fexofenadine is decreased in patients with renal impairment. In patients with mild
creatinine clearance (Clr) 2.46 to 4.80 L/h (41 to
80 ml/min)] or moderate to severe [Cl,; 0.66 to 2.40
L/h (11 to 40 ml/min)] renal impairment, Cmax was
increased by 87 and 111% and ty, was prolonged
by 59 and 72%, respectively (relative to values in
healthy volunteers with normal renal function).!!71
In patients with severe renal dysfunction [Cl,; <0.6
L/h (10 ml/min)] receiving dialysis, Cmax was 82%
higher and the ty, 31% longer than in volunteers
with normal renal function. Haemodialysis is not
particularly effective in removing fexofenadine
from blood (<1.7% removal). Lower starting dosages are, therefore, recommended in the US in patients with renal dysfunction (see section 6).

Mild to severe hepatic impairment (according to
Child-Pugh criteria) did not affect the pharmacokinetic properties of fexofenadine to a great extent.
There were no differences between the population
estimate and values in 151 patients with mild to
moderate or moderate to severe liver impairment
for Cmax (0.24, 0.27, 0.28 mg/L), AUC (1.73,
1.70, 2.18 mg/L +h), Cl, (not available, 4.09, 3.63
L/h) or ty, (14, 11, 16 hours).'4!] Hence dosage adjustments are not required in patients with hepatic
dysfunction (see section 6),4!]

In elderly volunteers (aged 65 to 80 years, n =
20) administered a single oral 80mg dose of
fexofenadine, total clearance was reduced, and
Cmax and AUC values were increased compared
with those in younger (19 to 45 years, n = 110)
recipients.47] However, as AUC values remained
well within limits demonstrated to be safe in clinical trials, these changes were not considered to be
clinically significant. The pharmacokinetic properties of single 30 and 60mg doses of fexofenadine
in children with allergies (mean age 9.8 years, n=
14) were similar to those reported in adults.!#91

Systemic exposure to fexofenadine was greater
in females than males, although the differences
were not clinically significant. Cmax and AUC values were higher (46 and 33%, respectively) in female (n = 20) than in male volunteers (n = 20)
receiving fexofenadine 40 to 400mg twice daily
but Cl, was unchanged.!!?.44]

3.2 Drug Interactions

Hepatic metabolism is of minimal importance
in the elimination of fexofenadine; hence, in contrast to terfenadine, enzyme inhibition should have
little effect on plasma concentrations of the drug.
Nonetheless, coadministration of erythromycin or
ketoconazole with fexofenadine resulted in substantial increases in steady state fexofenadine
plasma concentrations (table III). Importantly,
plasma concentrations of fexofenadine remained
within the range achieved in clinical trials and QT,
intervals were unchanged in volunteers receiving
either combination (see also section 5.1). Studies
in animal models suggest that the mechanism responsible for these interactions is enhanced gastrointestinal absorption and/or decreased biliary excretion or gastrointestinal secretion.!!2] The
antidiabetic drug troglitazone (600mg once daily)
reduced the AUC of a single 120mg dose of

4. Therapeutic Efficacy

4.1 Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis

The efficacy of fexofenadine as treatment for
seasonal allergic rhinitis has been investigated in
adults and adolescents (aged 212 years) in several
randomised, double-blind, multicentre trials.{4°53]
Treatment was for a duration of <3 weeks, preceded by a 3- to 7-day placebo lead-in period. Patients had moderate to severe seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms and had a positive epicutaneous
skin test response to spring allergen at the screening visit or during the previous 15-month period.
In many studies, patients had a history of seasonal
allergic rhinitis during the 2 preceding fall ragweed
pollen seasons!4748.505153] and were required to
have a history of responding to antihistamine treatment for seasonal allergic rhinitis.[48-5°.521

Patients provided a subjective, reflective (based
on the preceding 12[46.47,49.50.52] oy 24148,51.53]
hours) assessment of the severity of their allergy
symptoms. In | study, investigator assessments of
symptom severity were also reported.!471 Assessments were made at trough drug concentration
times, either in the morning or evening, shortly before taking study medication. The morning and
evening 12-hour reflective assessments were averaged to give the 24-hour reflective individual
symptom scores and the 24-hour reflective total
symptom score (TSS). Symptoms evaluated included: nasal congestion; sneezing; rhinorrhoea;
itchy nose, palate and throat; and itchy, watery and
red eyes. Each symptom was evaluated on a 4- or
5-point scale, with 0 = absent and 3 or 4 = very
severe (requiring physician visit).

The primary efficacy measure was generally the
reflective TSS, which was the sum of the above
individual symptom scores. Nasal congestion was
generally excluded from the TSS, with the exception of 2 studies, !4°-47] because it is not expected to
respond to antihistamine therapy. To establish
whether effectiveness was maintained for 24

hours, an instantaneous TSS assessment of the previous 30 or 60 minutes was made shortly before the
next treatment to determine efficacy at trough
blood levels.!4953] In 1 trial, the instantaneous TSS
was used as the primary end-point instead of a reflective TSS.64]

4.1.1 Placebo-Controlled Dose Ranging Studies

Table IV summarises results from dose-ranging
evaluations of the efficacy of fexofenadine in
adults with seasonal allergic rhinitis.49>'] Two
weeks’ treatment with fexofenadine, once (120 or
180mg)5" or twice (40 to 240mg)49"l daily, produced significantly (p < 0.01) greater improvements in TSS than placebo (table IV). The efficacy
of fexofenadine was generally maintained throughout the 12-!49:5l or 24-hour!!! period, as assessed
by the instantaneous TSS (table IV). The onset of
action (estimated through responses to the bedtime
and 7am instantaneous assessment after the first
dose) of fexofenadine 60 and 120mg twice daily (1
to 3 hours) was faster than that of 40mg twice daily
(S12 hours).5°] Fexofenadine dosages above 120
mg/day did not enhance efficacy beyond the level
achieved with this dosage. The symptoms of sneezing; rhinorrhoea; itchy, watery, red eyes; and itchy
nose, palate or throat were generally improved significantly more than placebo with fexofenadine
dosages 2120 mg/day (p < 0.05) [table IV].!495!]

Nasal congestion, which was not included in the
TSS, was generally reduced by fexofenadine dosages >120 mg/day.05!] Significant improvements
in nasal congestion were generally seen in patients
treated with 260mg twice daily!49! and 120mg once
daily! (p < 0.05 vs placebo; table IV).

4.1.2 Versus Other Antihistamines

Fexofenadine has been compared with other antihistamines in several short-term, randomised,
double-blind, multicentre trials in adults and adolescents with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Fexofenadine 2120 mg/day, loratadine 10 mg/day and cetirizine 10 mg/day significantly improved TSS to a
greater extent than placebo after | to 2 weeks’ treatment (table IV).!4648.53] In general, all 3 agents improved TSS to a similar extent. Instantaneous TSS

fenadine 120mg (p < 0.003), fexofenadine 180mg
and cetirizine 10mg once daily (p < 0.0001), indicating 24-hour effectiveness.[53]

Individual symptom scores (not including nasal
congestion) reported in | study were significantly
improved by fexofenadine and loratadine, except
itchy, watery, red eyes, for which the improvement
was significant only with fexofenadine (p < 0.0001
vs placebo).(48] Moreover, nasal congestion improved in recipients of fexofenadine (p = 0.0076)
and cetirizine (p = 0.0199) compared with placebo.[53]

In a 2-week crossover study (table IV), fexofenadine and loratadine elicited similar response
rates (evaluated through patient and investigator
assessment of symptom severity) [57 and 61%, respectively].[47] Nonresponders after the first 2
weeks were switched to the comparator for a further 2 weeks of treatment. During the second, nonrandomised phase of the study, the mean reduction
in total symptom severity (investigator and patient
assessment) in nonresponders from the first phase
was similar with fexofenadine and loratadine.!47] A
retrospective cohort study of 33 439 patients with
seasonal allergic rhinitis during the spring-fall
1997-98 allergy season suggested that the continuity of prescribing was greater for fexofenadine than
loratadine recipients.>>] Furthermore, there appeared to be a lower switching rate from fexofenadine to loratadine than from loratadine to fexofenadine amongst these patients.!?]

4.1.3 In Combination with Pseudoephedrine

Fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine, an o-adrenergic agonist with decongestant properties,
have complementary activity in patients with ragweed-induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. After
14 to 20 days’ treatment, improvements in TSS
(which did not include nasal congestion) were significantly greater in patients treated with
fexofenadine 60mg plus pseudoephedrine 120mg
twice daily than pseudoephedrine alone (p < 0.05;
table IV). Furthermore, nasal congestion scores
improved to a significantly greater extent in patients treated with the combination compared with
those receiving fexofenadine alone (p < 0.05). Im

4.2 Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria

The efficacy of fexofenadine for the treatment
of chronic idiopathic urticaria has been investigated in 2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trials lasting for 45° or 667]
weeks. In | study, the primary efficacy end-point
was the mean daily TSS, measured as the sum of
the patient’s scores for pruritus and number of
wheals.!>7! Patients assessed the intensity of itching
on a 4-point scale (where 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 =
moderate and 3 = severe). The number of wheals
was also recorded on a scale of 0 to 4 (where 0 =
none, | = 1 to 5,2 =6 to 15,3 = 16 to 25 and 4=
>25).(57] In the second study, the primary endpoint was change from baseline in daily mean pruritus severity scores. The mean daily TSS was a
secondary end-point, along with daily mean number of wheals.'5°) To date there have been no trials
comparing the efficacy of fexofenadine with other
antihistamines for the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria.

Fexofenadine dosages 220mg twice daily in 1
study] or 2180mg once daily in the second
study57] produced significant improvements in
TSS compared with placebo (p < 0.001° and p <
0.004117] vs placebo) [fig. 1]. Mean pruritus severity scores significantly decreased (by 0.36 to 1.18
points; p< 0.02 vs placebo) in patients treated with
fexofenadine >40 mg/day.&°57] However, the decreases in mean pruritus score were larger with
fexofenadine dosages >120 mg/day.°! In contrast
to the finding in 1 study!5° that all fexofenadine
dosages (40 to 480 mg/day) reduced the number of
wheals (p = 0.0001 vs placebo), only patients
treated with fexofenadine 180 mg/day (but not 60,
120 or 240 mg/day) reported a reduction in the
number of wheals in the second study (p = 0.0064
for fexofenadine 180 mg/day vs placebo). However, according to per-protocol analysis, as opposed to intention-to-treat analysis, the effect of
fexofenadine 240 mg/day was also significant (p =

4.3 Quality of Life

As the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis
can have a major effect on patients’ daily activities,
health-related quality of life assessments are also
important indirect indicators of efficacy. Quality of
life scores for the previous | or 2 weeks were assessed using validated instruments at the end of a
number of studies in patients with seasonal allergic
rhinitis or chronic idiopathic urticaria.5*-l Instruments included the patient-assessed full- or miniRhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life questionnaire
(RQLQ)|48:6!-63] [scale 0 to 6, with 6 being worse],

Fexofenadine 2120 mg/day improved quality of
life in adults and adolescents with seasonal allergic
rhinitis. Compared with placebo, overall RQLQ
scores were reduced from baseline (change from
baseline 20.57 points) after 1 and 2 weeks’ treatment in randomised, double-blind!®-] or nonblind!®'] trials involving 776,!7! 845(%] [fig. 2] and
292516] patients. In 1 study presented as an abstract,!°!] all individual RQLQ domain scores were
reduced from baseline (p < 0.001 vs placebo) and
in another study! 3 of 7 domains (activity, practical problems and nasal congestion) were reduced
(change from baseline 21.4 points; p < 0.05 vs placebo) after 2 weeks’ treatment with fexofenadine.

Compared with placebo, work and activity impairment decreased with fexofenadine 2120 mg/
day (change from baseline 27.1%; p < 0.05! or p
< 0.00411), as assessed by the WPAI in 2 studies
enrolling 559!! (fig. 2) or 38919] fexofenadine
recipients. Overall impairment in the classroom,
assessed by the WPAI in 45 patients (aged 212
years), was also reduced (change from baseline
19%) in fexofenadine recipients but this improvement was not statistically significant versus baseline after 2 weeks’ treatment.!®1

In comparative trials in patients with seasonal
allergic rhinitis (presented in sections 4.1.2 and
4.1.3), fexofenadine 120 mg/day produced greater
improvements in quality of life than loratadine 10
mg/day/48] and enhanced patients’ quality of life
when added to pseudoephedrine 120 mg/day.!*?!
The mean reduction in RQLQ scores (n= 538) with
fexofenadine was —1.43 points (p < 0.01 vs placebo) compared with —1.13 after loratadine (p <
0.05 between treatments) and —1.06 with placebo.!48] The difference between fexofenadine and
loratadine was considered to be clinically relevant.l48]

Improvements in mean daily activity impairment scores and work productivity in employed
patients were significantly greater with the combination of fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine (13
and 9.3%, respectively) compared with pseudoephedrine alone (7.9 p = 0.006 and 6.2% p < 0.05,

5. Tolerability

Fexofenadine was well tolerated in clinical trials in adults and adolescents (aged 212 years) with
seasonal allergic rhinitis or chronic idiopathic urticaria and in children aged 6 to 11 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis. The tolerability of fexofenadine ($240 mg/day for up to 6 weeks and <480
mg/day for up to 4 weeks) has been assessed in
randomised, double-blind, multicentre trials involving >6000 patients .{46535657.65]

In these studies, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events associated with fexofenadine
(7.1 to 30%) was similar to, or lower than, that with
placebo (7.6 to 33%).(4649-51.53.57] The incidence of
adverse events associated with fexofenadine did
not show any dose relationship. The most frequently reported adverse event during treatment
with fexofenadine was headache (2.5 to 26%),
which occurred with a similar incidence to that
seen in placebo recipients (2.8 to 18%),[464851,53,56.57] 1.2 to 7% of fexofenadine recipients discontinued treatment because of adverse events,
compared with 1.4 to 20% of patients receiving
placebo.!49-5!.53.57] There were no clinically significant changes from baseline in electrocardiographic parameters (see section 5.1), vital signs or
clinical laboratory values in patients treated with
fexofenadine.

The above results were confirmed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
of 875 children (aged 6 to 11 years) with seasonal
allergic rhinitis treated with fexofenadine 15, 30 or
60mg twice daily for 16 days.!%*] The incidence of
adverse events in fexofenadine recipients (34.7 to
36.8%) was similar to that seen in placebo recipients (36.2%) and to those reported in adults.

The incidence of adverse events in elderly patients (aged 60 to 68 years) who received fexo

fenadine 20 to 240mg twice daily for up to 2 weeks
was similar to that in patients under the age of
60, [12.66]

Fexofenadine 120 mg/day was associated with
a similar incidence of treatment-related adverse
events to loratadine (7.1 to 22.1% vs 9.5 to
18.2%)|46-48] and cetirizine (23 vs 25%)! [both 10
mg/day]. However, fexofenadine has demonstrated no increased incidence of sedation or
drowsiness compared with placebo, even at dosages exceeding those recommended (see section
5.2).

In a 2-week trial of 651 patients, fexofenadine
60mg twice daily showed a significantly (p <
0.001) lower incidence of adverse events than
pseudoephedrine 120mg twice daily or the combination of the 2 agents (16.5, 36.7 and 34.9%, respectively).52] The most common treatment-related adverse events were headache (fexofenadine
7.3%, pseudoephedrine 12.4% and the combination 9.3%) and insomnia (fexofenadine 1.8%,
pseudoephedrine 12.8% and the combination
11.2%),71

Ina UK general practice study in 16 638 patients
the most commonly reported adverse events leading to discontinuation of fexofenadine were headache (20 patients), nausea (16 patients) and rash
(14 patients).!67] Dizziness, drowsiness and dry
mouth have been reported during overdose with
fexofenadine. Importantly, in volunteers, single
doses of up to 800mg (n = 6) and dosages up to
690mg twice daily for | month (n= 3) produced no
adverse events in clinical trials, indicating a wide
safety margin. [!?.36.66]

In 2 long term, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trials of fexofenadine 60mg twice daily for 6 months (n = 428) and
240mg once daily for 12 months (n = 469) the most
common treatment-related adverse event was
headache which occurred with a similar incidence
to that with placebo (15.7 vs 17.1% in the 6-month
study and 31.2 vs 36.2% in the 12-month study,
respectively).!°8] Overall, there was no statistically
significant difference between fexofenadine and
placebo in the incidence of adverse events (6

month 74.2 vs 79.6% and 12-month 92.8 vs 87.6%,
respectively). Importantly, there was no difference
in the incidence of fatigue between those receiving
fexofenadine 60mg twice daily (0.5%), 240mg
once daily (1.3%) and placebo (6-month 1.9% and
12-month 2.6%) In the 6-month study, 1.8% of
fexofenadine recipients and 3.8% of those in the
placebo group withdrew because of treatment-related adverse events and in the 12-month study 4.3
and 5.1%, respectively, withdrew for this reason.
In both trials there were no clinically significant
laboratory anomalies and no significant change in
blood pressure or heart rate.!6*]

In the above long term studies, 6 patients were
exposed to fexofenadine during pregnancy (duration of exposure between 2 and 6 weeks) with no
apparent drug-related adverse effects on their delivered babies.

5.1 Cardiac Effects

No adverse electrocardiographic events were
detected during randomised, placebo-controlled
clinical trials with fexofenadine. Cardiotoxicity including life-threatening arrhythmias, which manifest as torsades de pointes, has been associated
with the nonsedating antihistamines astemizole
and terfenadine.!®! Further research has demonstrated that this was not an effect common to all
nonsedating antihistamines. These effects were not
observed in clinical trials with fexofenadine.?%3¢]

The results of cardiac analyses (electrocardiographic assessments) in 2 randomised, doubleblind clinical studies reviewed in section
4.1.1149.50] (n = 1160) showed no significant increases in mean QT, in patients receiving
fexofenadine (40 to 240mg twice daily) compared
with placebo recipients (fig. 3).(?836] In addition,
there were no significant increases in QT, with increasing doses of fexofenadine.!?*3¢] Among the
1160 patients, 6% of those exposed to placebo or
fexofenadine 80 to 480 mg/day for 2 weeks had
baseline QT, values >440 msec and had an increase
of 210 msec over baseline. The maximum QT, values recorded were 488 and 484 msec in fexofenadine and placebo recipients, respectively.(?876]

Fig. 3. Mean change from baseline in corrected QT interval

randomised, double-blind, parallel group trials involving a total
of 1160 patients (870 fexofenadine and 290 placebo recipients)
with seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms. Electrocardiographs
were collected before randomisation and at 1 to 3 hours after
the final dose, when plasma levels of fexofenadine were expected to be highest. There were no significant increases in
mean QT, in patients receiving fexofenadine compared with
placebo recipients.24

Similar results were obtained in 3 parallel, placebo-controlled, long term studies of fexofenadine
80mg twice daily for 3 months (n = 41), 60mg
twice daily for 6 months (n = 425) and 240mg once
daily for 12 months (n = 464)I?§3¢] and in a
randomised, double-blind study comparing
fexofenadine 120mg twice daily with placebo for
120 days.!7°l In contrast with terfenadine, which
when given with ketoconazole and erythromycin
significantly prolongs QT,, no increase in this
parameter occurred when fexofenadine was administered with either drug. Only 5 and 6 patients
receiving fexofenadine 120mg twice daily in combination with erythromycin 500mg 4 times daily (n
= 19) or ketoconazole 400mg once daily (n = 23),
respectively, for 6.5 days had QT, values >440
msec with an increase of at least 10 msec from
baseline.!?836] The range of values in these patients
was 442 to 459 msec with erythromycin and 441 to
475 msec with ketoconazole coadministration.283°]

Across all trials of fexofenadine, involving
>6000 patients, no episodes of torsades de pointes

have been observed, and the incidence of heart rate
or rhythm disturbances was 0.3 and 0.1% among
patients treated with fexofenadine or placebo, respectively.2861

However, QT, prolongation, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation
were reported in a 67-year-old man during treatment with fexofenadine 180 mg/day.!”!] Importantly, this patient was not typical of those exposed
to the drug during clinical trials. He had hypertension, ventricular hypertrophy and an abnormally
long QT, (494 msec) prior to receiving fexofenadine. His QT, decreased from 532 to 489 msec after
withdrawal of the drug, but increased to 512 msec
after rechallenge at which time he experienced ventricular fibrillation. Although this case suggests the
potential for adverse events in patients predisposed
to cardiac arrhythmias, further study is required to
confirm or exclude a cause and effect relationship
for fexofenadine.!7!] An effect of fexofenadine on
the QT, interval is unexpected as it has been demonstrated that the drug has a very low affinity for
the cardiac K* channels (see section 2.4).

5.2 Central Effects

A common adverse event associated with the
use of first generation antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine and promethazine)
is sedation. In contrast, newer antihistamines have
minimal effects on the central nervous system, as
they are not lipophilic and do not cross the bloodbrain barrier.!72!

Evidence indicates that there is no cognitive or
psychomotor impairment with fexofenadine dosages up to 240 mg/day. In contrast with this,
cetirizine and loratadine, which show no adverse
central effects at recommended dosages, have been
associated with detrimental central effects when
the recommended dosages are exceeded.!73] In general, fexofenadine <240 mg/day did not impair
cognitive, psychomotor or driving performance in
double-blind, crossover trials in which centrally
active, sedating antihistamines (e.g. promethazine,
diphenhydramine and clemastine) or alcohol were
included as positive controls.!74-77] The sole excep

tion was in 1 study,!75] in which patients had an
impairment in the critical tracking test on the first
day of treatment with fexofenadine 2120 mg once
daily; these results contrast with those of other
studies.!75] Single doses of fexofenadine 80 to
180mg or loratadine 10mg did not impair psychomotor and cognitive function in 24 volunteers.!7°]
Similarly, single doses of fexofenadine 120 to 240
mg/day did not affect performance or sleepiness in
6 volunteers.!74! In contrast, promethazine 10 to
30mg decreased performance in a number of tests
and increased sleep-like activity.(7476] Driving performance was not affected by single 60mg or multiple dosages <240 mg/day of fexofenadine in 40
patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis!’7] and 24
healthy volunteers.!75]

6. Dosage and Administration

In the US, the recommended dosage of fexofenadine for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis is 60mg twice daily, alone or in combination
with pseudoephedrine 120mg, for adults and adolescents aged >12 years.!'?] Increasing the dosage
does not provide additional benefit.!”8] The combination product should not be used at the same time
as tricyclic antidepressants, sympathomimetic
agents (such as decongestants, appetite suppressants and amphetamine-like psychostimulants) or
with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, as their use is
contraindicated with pseudoephedrine. The US
FDA has recently classed as approvable a once
daily formulation of fexofenadine for the treatment
of seasonal allergic rhinitis and the use of the drug
in children aged 6 to 12 years with seasonal allergic
rhinitis and for the treatment of chronic idiopathic
urticaria. In the UK, the recommended dosage of
fexofenadine for relief of symptoms of seasonal
allergic rhinitis is 120mg once daily and the recommended dosage of fexofenadine for the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria is 180mg once
daily.[79]

In the US, but not the UK, a dosage of 60mg
once daily is recommended as the starting dosage
for relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients
with decreased renal function or those on haemodialy

sis.!78] Dosage adjustment is not necessary in elderly patients or in those with hepatic impairment.!78]

There is limited data on the use of fexofenadine
during pregnancy!®*! (see section 5) but it is not
known if the drug is excreted in human milk.
Fexofenadine is a category C drug according to the
US FDA.

7. Place of Fexofenadine in the
Management of Seasonal Allergic
Rhinitis and Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria

Allergic rhinitis affects 20 to 40 million Americans annually and, in some patients, can be seriously debilitating./4! In the US, the direct and indirect costs associated with allergic rhinitis
(including perennial allergic rhinitis) were approximately 2.7 billion dollars in 1995.'4] Rhinitis is
also a significant cause of absenteeism from work
and school, and is associated with decreased work
productivity.

Initial management of allergic rhinitis involves
allergen avoidance to reduce or eliminate exposure. Should this fail to prevent the condition, pharmacological therapy may be instigated to reduce
any inflammatory reactions. If drug therapy is unsuccessful, allergen immunotherapy, which entails
sequential subcutaneous or local (e.g. sublingual
or nasal) introduction of increasing doses of specific allergens to which the patient is sensitive, can
be considered.[808'] This measure is able to modify
the immunological response to the allergen and reduce allergen-induced inflammation in patients
who do not respond satisfactorily to other treatment.

Pharmacological measures should be tailored to
the cause and pathophysiology of the condition and
treatment should be targeted to specific symptom
severity. Initiating regular prophylactic use of
medication at the beginning of the pollen season or
2 to 5 hours before allergen exposure will enhance
benefits.!41 Oral antihistamines are usually the
first-line therapy for allergic rhinitis. They are considered effective in 70 to 95% of patients in reducing symptoms of itching, sneezing and rhinor

rhoea, but have less of an effect on nasal congestion.!482] Oral or nasal decongestants (e.g. pseudoephedrine) can effectively reduce nasal congestion, but have no effect on other symptoms of
allergic rhinitis such as pruritus, sneezing and rhinorrhoea.!8°! Decongestants are often given in
combination with antihistamines; however, these
agents are sometimes associated with central and
cardiovascular adverse effects, and must be used
with caution in some patients.!4! Fexofenadine and
pseudoephedrine complimented each other in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and severe nasal congestion.

Intranasal corticosteroids, available as prescription medication only in most countries, are the
most effective medication for controlling nasal
congestion, rhinorrhoea, itching and sneezing and
are particularly useful when antihistamines fail to
provide relief.[8°83] With the exception of intranasal dexamethasone, these agents are generally
not associated with systemic adverse effects in
adults, although this is always a concern. The most
common adverse effect is local irritation which
manifests as nasal burning, stinging and bleeding,
and on rare occasions there have been reports of
nasal septal perforations.(4.83] If treatment with
intranasal corticosteroids is not successful, a short
course of oral corticosteroids may be useful in severe cases.!4] However, long term use of these
agents may lead to systemic adverse effects (e.g.
suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis).{4]

Other pharmacological therapies include mast
cell stabilisers (e.g. sodium cromoglycate) and
intranasal anticholinergic agents (e.g. ipratropium
bromide). Sodium cromoglycate effectively reduces nasal pruritus, sneezing, rhinorrhoea and nasal obstruction, but has a modest effect on nasal
congestion.'®°] Anticholinergic agents effectively
reduce rhinorrhoea, but have no effect on nasal
itching, sneezing or congestion.!8°! There is some
evidence that oral anti-leukotriene agents (e.g.
montelukast) may provide benefits in patients with
allergic rhinitis, but they are not approved for this

indication and their usefulness needs to be clarified
by further study./41

Urticaria affects approximately 20% of the general population during their lifetime.!7] Chronic episodes, lasting in excess of 6 weeks, can seriously
reduce quality of life in affected patients. The
mainstay of treatment for chronic idiopathic urticaria is antihistamines.!”] Histamine H, receptor
antagonists are the first-line treatment. However,
for best effect they should be administered on a
routine basis before the onset of symptoms, as
these agents are unable to displace bound histamine. 8]

Additional histamine Hz receptor blockade may
be useful in some patients whose urticaria is inadequately controlled by histamine H; receptor antagonism alone.!®] In addition, tricyclic antidepressants, such as doxepin, not only exhibit powerful
antagonism of histamine H,; receptors but also
block histamine Hp receptors.!7] However, these
agents have strong anticholinergic and sedating
side effects.'*] If antihistamines are ineffective, a
short course of oral glucocorticoids (e.g. prednisolone or prednisone) may be effective.!7*]
However, the potential adverse effects of these
medications need to be weighed against the potential benefits.

Fexofenadine was effective in relieving symptoms in adolescents and adults with seasonal allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. In
short term (1 to 2 weeks’ duration), comparative
trials, fexofenadine 60mg twice daily or 120mg
once daily was as effective as recommended dosages of loratadine or cetirizine in the overall relief
of symptoms in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Fexofenadine has not been directly compared
with intranasal corticosteroids for the treatment of
seasonal allergic rhinitis. Although there have been
no comparative trials, fexofenadine 180mg once
daily was effective in reducing the symptoms of
chronic idiopathic urticaria for up to 6 weeks. Patients with both indications registered associated
improvements in quality of life after taking
fexofenadine. In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, there was a clinically relevant improvement

in quality of life with fexofenadine over loratadine.
Fexofenadine has a rapid onset of action, with patients experiencing relief of symptoms within 2
hours, and its long duration of action provides the
convenient option of once daily administration (not
yet approved in the US).

In clinical trials, fexofenadine was well tolerated in adults and children. In contrast with terfenadine and astemizole, fexofenadine, alone or in
combination with erythromycin or ketoconazole,
appears to be free of adverse cardiac events. Importantly, in clinical trials there was no significant QT,
prolongation with fexofenadine.!?°3°] Further experience in patients with cardiovascular disease is
required to firmly establish this. In addition,
fexofenadine (at dosages up to 240 mg/day) seems
to lack the sedative effects associated with first
generation antihistamines, unlike loratadine and
cetirizine, which can produce central nervous system effects if used at dosages exceeding those recommended. Therefore it should be suitable to take
before driving or operating machinery.

In conclusion, fexofenadine is clinically effective in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis
and chronic idiopathic urticaria for which it is a
suitable option for first-line therapy. Comparative
data suggest that fexofenadine is as effective as
loratadine or cetirizine in the treatment of seasonal
allergic rhinitis. In those with excessive nasal congestion the combination of fexofenadine plus pseudoephedrine may be useful. In clinical trials
fexofenadine is not associated with adverse cardiac
or cognitive/psychomotor effects.
