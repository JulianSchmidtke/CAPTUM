Autologous serum skin test vs autologous plasma
skin test in patients with chronic urticaria:
evaluation of reproducibility, sensitivity and
specificity and relationship with disease activity,
quality of life and anti-thyroid antibodies

Recent concerns have arisen about the specificity and interpretation of
the autologous serum skin test (ASST), suggesting that ASST might
produce false-positive results, and proposing the use of autologous
plasma (APST) instead for intradermal testing in autoreactive urticaria.
We investigated autoreactivity to autologous plasma and compared the
results for reproducibility, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy and evaluated their association with quality of life and anti-TPO antibodies. 70
adults with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CU) and 62 controls underwent testing with ASST and APST and the tests were repeated two days
after the first visit. Blood tests measured anti-TPO levels. Disease activity was assessed by urticaria activity score (UAS-7) and quality of life
impairment was assessed by DLQI and CU-Q20L. There were no statistically significant differences between ASST (+) and ASST (-) and also
APST (+) and APST (-) patients with regard to disease duration, antiTPO antibodies, urticaria activity scores, DLQI scores and CU-Q)0L
scores. The results of first ASST and APST were well correlated with
the results of second ASST and APST. The specificity of the two tests
was similar, while ASST had a higher sensitivity and accuracy. Our
results showed that there is no need to use autologous plasma instead of
autologous serum for intradermal testing in CU.

hronic spontaneous urticaria (CU) describes a

6-week or longer history of widespread, transient, itchy cutaneous swellings with or without
angioedema which affect 25% of the population at some
time in their life [1, 2]. Pathogenic mechanisms such as
chronic infections, food intolerance, non-infectious chronic
inflammatory processes (gastritis, oesophagitis) have been
elucidated to be responsible for the development of CU
and there have been long discussions on the role of atopy
during the past years [3-5]. Recently, an underlying autoimmune mechanism involving anti-high affinity IgE receptor
(FceRI]) antibodies or anti-IgE antibodies that are capable
of activating mast cell and basophil degranulation was proposed [6]. In a subset of CU patients, intradermal injection
of autologous serum (autologous serum skin test, ASST)
elicits a wheal-and-flare skin reaction which suggests the
presence of a serum factor [7]. The ASST is an in vivo
validated test performed by injecting the patient’s own
serum into the skin which results positive in 30-67% of
patients [8, 9]. Even though ASST is widely used and
well established, there are concerns about the interpretation and specificity of the test. Some authors suggested that
ASST might produce false-positive results because of the

EJD, vol. 21, n° 3, May-June 2011

generation of large quantities of bradykinin during the
clotting process and direct cleavage of C5 by tryptaselike
plasma proteases secreted by neutrophils [10, 11]. Asero
et al. proposed using autologous plasma (APST, autologous plasma skin test) instead of autologous serum which
would be expected to result in a better specificity of testing
[12].

The first aim of this study was to investigate whether CU
patients are reacting to autologous plasma injections and
then to compare the results of ASST and APST with regard
to reproducibility, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy and
evaluate their association with quality of life and antithyroid antibodies.

physical urticaria and/or dermographism and pregnancy
were excluded. The control group consisted a total of 62
subjects who had no history of an autoimmune and/or systemic allergic disease: 11 healthy volunteers, 8 lichenoid
dermatitis (localized lichen planus, lichen simplex chronicus, hypertrophic lichen), 24 eczema (localized irritant
contact dermatitis, hand eczema, dyshidrotic dermatitis,
eyelid eczema, neurodermatitis), 6 psoriasis (localized
chronic plaque type or palmoplantar pustulosis), 4 localized pruritus (genital, scrotal, anal pruritus), 1 erythema
annulare centrifugum, 2 acne rosacea, | postinflammatory
hyperpigmentation, 2 folliculitis, 1 seborrheic dermatitis
and 2 localized dermatophyte infection.

The CU patients underwent an extensive laboratory workup including complete blood count, metabolic panel,
anti-TPO antibodies, urine and stool analysis, complement
and immunoglobulin levels, hepatitis markers and chest and
sinus X-rays.

Skin tests

We performed intradermal tests with both autologous
serum, autologous plasma, normal saline (negative control)
and histamine (positive control) as previously described
[12, 13]. After cessation of antihistaminic treatment at least
for 3 days, venous blood samples were drawn into sterile
tubes without clotting accelerator for ASST. Tubes containing Na citrate (0.125 mol/L of Na-citrate) were used to
inhibit coagulation for APST. The samples were allowed to
clot for 30 minutes at room temperature and centrifuged at
500 g for 15 minutes. We performed 0.05 mL of intradermal injections which were replaced 3 cm away from each
other on the volar surface of the left arm and we waited
for 30 minutes to evaluate the wheal and flare reactions. A
wheal with a diameter of at least 1.5 mm greater than that
of the negative control was considered as positive. To check
the reproducibility of ASST and APST, we withdrew blood
again and repeated the tests after two days on the same
arm. The first and second readings were performed by the
same investigator (EK) without checking the result of the
first test. None of the patients was taking systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs at time of testing. The
patients and controls gave informed consent and the study
was approved by the local Ethics committee.

Measurements

The disease activity was assessed by UAS7; a validated
scoring system combining the intensity of itch and the number of wheals every day for one week [14]. To evaluate the
quality of life impairment due to urticaria we used Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and Chronic Urticaria
Quality of Life Questionnaire (CU-Q20L). The DLQI is a
quality of life instrument for any kind of skin disease which
has been validated for use in Turkey [15, 16]. The CU-Q0L
is a quality of life questionnaire specifically designed for
CU which was originally developed in Italy [17]. The author
(EK) performed the validation study of the questionnaire
which is in the process of being published. The patients
scored their urticarial symptoms one week before testing
on a daily basis and filled out the DLQI and CU-Qo0L
questionnaires the day before testing.

Statistical analysis

For interpretation of the results, descriptive statistical methods (mean, standard deviation) as well as unpaired T-test for
comparison of groups, Chi-Square test and odds ratio for
comparing quantitative data were used.

We used weighted kappa statistics to define the concordance
between the first and second ASST and APST; and intraclass correlation coefficient to compare serum and plasma
diameters. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and likelihood ratios between ASST, APST
and anti-TPO values were calculated. The results were evaluated within P values of <0.05 and a confidence interval
of 95%. The NCSS 2007 statistical software was used for
statistical analysis.

Results

Characteristics of the study sample

A total of 70 CU patients (77% female; age: 28-53 years;
40.6+12.7) participated in this study. The control group
consisted of 62 subjects. There were no statistically significant differences with respect to age and gender between
patients and the control group. The mean duration of
urticaria was 32+64.7 (range 2-360) months. Forty-one
(57%) had angioedema and 16 (23%) had positive antiTPO antibodies while only three subjects (8%) had positive
anti-TPO antibodies in the control group. Anti-TPO positivity was found three-fold increased in CU patients. Only
three (4%) of the patients had NSAID intolerance and eight
(11%) had accompanying autoimmune and/or allergic diseases: two had allergic rhinitis, two had vitiligo, one had
asthma and four had an established autoimmune thyroid
disease. One of the patients had both vitiligo and asthma.
Mean UAS7 score was 20+11.4 (range 0-42), mean DLQI
score was 9.7+7.6 (range 0-30) and mean CU-QoL score
was 35+19.4 (range 4.3-94.6).

The characteristics of the patients and controls are shown
in table 1.

 

 

 

 

 

Skin tests

ASST and APST scored positive in 44 (63%) vs. 27 (39%)
of the patients, respectively. In the control group we found
9 (14.5%) subjects with a positive ASST and 10 (16%) subjects with a positive APST. ASST was positive in 2 healthy
controls, one psoriasis, four eczema, one localized pruritus and one lichen planus patient. APST was positive in 3
healthy controls, 3 eczema, one dermatophyte infection and
two psoriasis patients. One patient with eyelid eczema and
one healthy control was positive on both ASST and APST.
Twenty-five (36%) patients scored positive both on ASST
and APST, while 19 (27%) patients scored positive on
ASST and negative on APST. There were only two patients
who scored positive on APST and negative on ASST.
Twenty-four patients scored negative on both ASST and
APST (table 2).

There was a statistically significant difference between
patients and controls with respect to ASST and APST positivity (p=0.0001, p=0.0001); CU patients had a 10-fold
and 3.2-fold increased risk for ASST and APST positivity
compared to the control group, respectively.

There were no statistically significant differences between
ASST (+) and ASST (-) patients with regard to gender, age,
disease duration, presence of angioedema, NSAID intolerance and allergic or autoimmune diseases, urticaria activity
scores, DLQI scores and CU-Q)0L scores (p>0.05). There
were no statistically significant differences between APST
(+) and APST (-) patients with regard to gender, age, disease
duration, presence of angioedema, NSAID intolerance and
allergic or autoimmune diseases, urticaria activity scores,
DLQI scores and CU-Q20L scores (p>0.05).

Of the 16 (23%) CU patients with anti-TPO antibodies,
9 (56%) scored positive on ASST and 6 (37.5%) scored
positive on APST. The ones with positive APST were all
positive on ASST. There were no significant differences
between ASST (+) and ASST (-) groups and also between
APST (+) and APST (-) groups with respect to anti-TPO
positivity. In the control group, only one subject with a positive anti-TPO antibody reacted both to ASST and APST.
Anti-TPO assay showed a specificity of 23% and a sensitivity of 92% between CU patients and healthy controls.
The positive predictive value for CU patients was 84% and
negative predictive value was 38%. The accuracy was low;
46% and the likelihood ratio was 2.74 (table 3).

The sensitivity and specificity of ASST when comparing
CU patients to healthy controls were 63% and 85%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 83%

and 67%, respectively. The test showed an accuracy of 73%
and the likelihood ratio was 4.33. This meant that the risk
of a positive ASST in CU patients was 4.33 fold increased
compared to healthy controls.

The sensitivity and specificity of APST when comparing
CU patients to healthy controls were 39% and 84%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 73%
and 55%, respectively. The test showed an accuracy of 60%,
which was lower than the accepted levels. The likelihoot
ratio for APST was 2.39.

Mean wheal diameter for serum and plasma was
5.6+4.7 mm (range 0-13) and 3.4+3.9 mm (range 0-11),
respectively. There were no statistically significant correlations between the mean wheal diameter for serum an
age, gender, presence of angioedema, duration of disease, urticaria activity scores, DLQI and CU-Q2oL scores
(p>0.05). There were no statistically significant correlations between the mean wheal diameter for plasma and age,
gender, presence of angioedema, duration of disease an
urticaria activity scores (p>0.05). The mean wheal diameter for plasma was positively correlated with DLQI an
CU-Q20L scores (p=0.044, p=0.017).

In patients with a positive ASST, the mean wheal diameter for serum and plasma was greater than that of patients
with a negative ASST (p=0.0001). In patients with a
positive APST, the mean wheal diameter for serum an
plasma was greater than that of patients with a negative
APST (p=0.0001, p=0.0001 and p=0.004, respectively). In
7 (16%) patients with a positive ASST, the mean wheal
diameter for serum and plasma were equivalent. Plasma
induced mean wheal diameter exceeded serum induce
diameter in 4 of ASST (+) patients and in 5 of APST (+)
patients. In 15 (55%) of APST (+) patients and 34 (77%)
of ASST (+) patients, serum induced mean wheal diameter
exceeded that induced by plasma.

The results of first ASST and APST were well correlate
with the results of second ASST and APST (kw=0.414,
p=0.001 and kw=0.256, p=0.01).

 

 

 

Discussion

Asero et al. suggested that the proportion of patients showing a wheal and flare reaction increases up to 86% when
autologous plasma is injected intradermally instead of

autologous serum in patients with CU. They also found
that APST test was positive in 70% of patients with a negative ASST and 98% of patients with a positive ASST. Only
one patient with a positive ASST scored negative on APST
[12]. Asero et al. hypothesized that coagulation cascade
was involved in the wheal and flare reaction, induced by
autologous plasma. He based this idea on the knowledge
that thrombin has been shown to induce oedema through
an increase in vascular permeability and to trigger mast
cell degranulation [18-20]. Following this study, Godse KV
from India reported 46% vs 46% positive results on both
ASST and APST and the wheal and flare area induced
by autologous serum was equivalent to that of autologous plasma in 13 of 14 cases [21]. Metz et al., reported
results from three centers; Spain, England and Germany. He
reported that ASST was positive in 37.5% while APST was
positive in 43% of chronic urticaria patients. In this study,
patients with a positive ASST were found to have a more
impaired quality of life and an increased disease activity
when compared to patients with a positive APST [22]. In
our study we found a positive APST in 39%, and a positive ASST in 63% of the patients, while 16% and 14.5%
were positive in the control group, respectively. Twentyfive (36%) of the patients were positive on both ASST and
APST. Of the ASST (+) patients, 56% scored positive on
APST, while 92% of the APST (+) patients scored positive
on ASST. There were only two patients who scored positive
on APST and negative on ASST. This finding showed that
ASST is a more sensitive tool than APST and has the ability
to detect more patients with autoreactive urticaria.

It has been shown that there is no association between
the ASST response and gender, age, personal or familial
history of atopy and age at onset [13, 23-27]. Likewise, in
our study we did not find any associations between ASST
(+) and ASST (-), APST (+) and APST (-) groups with
respect to age, gender, disease duration and personal atopy
history.

Presence of angioedema was found not to be associated
with ASST results [24, 28-31] except one study which suggested that presence of angioedema was more frequent in
ASST (+) patients [23]. There was no association between
presence of angioedema and skin test results in our series of
patients.

Caproni et al. [32] showed that urticarial episodes and number of wheals was higher in the ASST (+) group. Another
study showed that patients with positive ASST had more
wheals and higher itch scores [28]. We found no differences
between ASST (+) and ASST (-), APST (+) and APST (-)
groups with respect to disease activity.

Staubach et al. [31] demonstrated that ASST (+) patients
required significantly more antihistamines than ASST (-)
patients and experienced a longer (but not significantly)
duration of CU. We were not able to report this kind of
information, because almost all of the patients stopped their
antihistaminic drugs during the week they scored the UAS7.
But duration of the disease was not affected by the ASST
and APST test results in our study.

We found no differences between the ASST (+) and ASST
(-) patients with respect to quality of life scores and disease
activity, like Staubach et al. who could not show any differences between ASST (+) and ASST (-) patients in quality
of life scores [31]. We also found no differences between
the APST (+) and APST (-) patients with respect to quality
of life and disease activity, which matched the results of

342

 

Metz et al. [22]. In our study, there were no correlations
between the mean wheal diameter for serum and duration of disease, disease severity and quality of life scores,
like Kulthanan et al., who reported that serum-induced
wheal size of a positive ASST did not correlate with the
severity and duration of CU [24]. The mean wheal diameter for plasma was not correlated with duration of disease
and disease activity, but was positively correlated with quality of life scores. The significance of this finding remained
unexplained where the results of APST were not associated
with quality of life.

In the study of Asero et al. in patients with a positive ASST,
the mean diameter of the wheal and flare area induced by
autologous plasma exceeded that induced by autologous
serum in 51% and was equivalent in 46% of cases. In our
study, the mean wheal diameter for serum and plasma were
equivalent in 7 (16%) patients with a positive ASST. Plasma
induced mean wheal diameter exceeded serum induced
diameter in 4 of ASST (+) patients and in 5 of APST (+)
patients. In 15 (55%) of APST (+) patients and 34 (77%)
of ASST (+) patients, serum induced mean wheal diameter
exceeded that induced by plasma. We saw that serum wheal
was the prominent reaction in both ASST (+) and APST (+)
patients in contrast to Asero ef al. [12].

There is evidence of an increased prevalence of anti-thyroid
autoantibodies among CU patients; Lezznoff reported that
14.4% of CU patients have anti-thyroid antibodies [33]. We
found anti-TPO antibodies in 23% of our patient population,
where only 8% of control subjects had these antibodies.
Anti-TPO assay showed a high sensitivity albeit a low specificity between CU patients and healthy controls. In addition
we found no association between anti-TPO antibodies and
a positive ASST, while O’Donnell reported a significant
association [27]. In their study, 82% of chronic urticaria
patients with thyroid antibodies scored positive in ASST.
In our study population, 56% of patients with positive antiTPO antibodies scored positive on ASST and 37.5% of them
scored positive on APST. And positive APST results were
not associated with anti-TPO antibodies.

We compared ASST and APST with respect to their sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. The specificity of the two
tests was similar, while ASST was found to be more sensitive than APST in discriminating between CU patients and
controls. The ASST had a higher accuracy and likelihood
ratio than APST. These findings showed that ASST was
superior to APST with respect to sensitivity, accuracy and
likelihood ratios.

The reproducibility of ASST has been evaluated earlier by
Grattan and Sabroe in two separate studies [7, 8] and it was
found reproducible. We aimed to compare the reproducibility of two tests and found that the results of both ASST and
APST are reproducible.

Our results show that ASST is superior to APST in many
aspects and has the ability to detect more patients with
autoreactive urticaria than APST. Therefore there is no
need to use autologous plasma instead of autologous serum
for intradermal testing in autoreactive urticaria. The ASST
is a reproducible and sensitive skin test that should be
performed in all clinical settings where differentiation of
autoreactive urticaria is demanded. ll
