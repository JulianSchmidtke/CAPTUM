Abstract

Background: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common skin disorder,
but its clinical course reported so far is largely variable, probably due to the heterogeneity of the clinical background of patients and pathogenesis of this disease.
Methods: To reveal the prognosis of refractory CSU, we retrospectively studied
the patients who suffered from spontaneous urticaria for six weeks or longer at
their first visit to our outpatient clinic, who were insufficiently controlled by a
standard dose of antihistamine, and revisited from 2003 to 2009.

Results: Among 223 patients with CSU, 117 patients fulfilled the criteria mentioned above. Mean disease duration at first visit and mean duration of follow-up
at our hospital were 27.4 + 4.2 months and 18.7 + 1.9 months, respectively. By
using Kaplan-Meier methods, the estimated improved rates at 12 months,
24 months, and 60 months were 36.6%, 51.2%, and 66.1%, respectively. The
overall improvement rate of childhood cases (<19 years) was significantly higher
than that of adult cases (P = 0.007, log-rank test). Moreover, the improvement
rate of patients with short disease durations (<1 year at the first visit) was significantly (P = 0.003, log-rank test) higher than that of patients with long disease
durations (one year or more).

Conclusion: Our data indicate that the condition of patients with CSU can be
gradually improved even in intractable cases. Information about the clinical
course and prognostic factors of CSU in this study could help physicians predict
the prognosis of patients and ensure medication adherence of patients with CSU.

 

Urticaria is one of the most common skin diseases, and 0.5—
1.0% of population suffer from chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) (1). According to the current EAACI/GA?LEN/
EDF/WAO guideline (2), CSU is defined as the spontaneous
occurrence of symptoms, pruritic wheal, and flare for longer
than 6 weeks.

Several reports have indicated that IgG antibodies to IgE
and/or those to the high-affinity IgE receptor play a role in
the mechanism for activation of cutaneous mast cells and
blood basophils in up to 50% of the patients with CSU.
Moreover, a series of reports by Asero and his colleagues
shed light on the involvement of coagulation in the pathogenesis of CSU (3, 4). However, the frequent failure to identify a specific underlying cause, the unpredictable course of
symptoms, and high disease burden lead to frustration
among patients and their physicians (1).

Previous reports concerning the natural course of chronic
urticaria by other investigators have given variable results.
Gaig (5) and co-workers reported the duration of urticaria
in the Spanish population. They found a 0.6% prevalence
of chronic urticaria and demonstrated that 50% of patients
with nonacute urticaria were symptom-free after a 3-month
period. Moreover, only 11.3% of patients with chronic urticaria suffered from symptoms for more than 5 years. In
contrast, van der Valk et al. (6) reported that the proportion of patients who visited a Dutch hospital and entered
remission at five years was only 34%. However, in these
studies, the definitions of ‘chronic urticaria’ were unclear
and not strict as that of recently defined ‘CSU’. In fact,
physical urticaria and urticarial vasculitis were included in
Gaig’s definitions, whereas those clinical subtypes
are excluded from recently defined ‘CSU’. Thus, large

229
Clinical course of chronic spontaneous urticaria

variations and/or discrepancies among reports about the
prognosis are likely due to inconsistencies among the subjects studied.

In this study, to clarify the clinical course and prognostic
factors of intractable cases of CSU, we conducted a retrospective cohort study on the patients, who had visited Hiroshima University Hospital, while suffering from CSU that
was refractory to a standard dose of histamine H,-receptor
antagonist (antihistamine).

Methods
Subjects

Among 223 patients who suffered from CSU and visited
Hiroshima University Hospital from July 2003 to August
2009, we retrospectively studied the patients who were
insufficiently controlled by a standard dose of antihistamine
and followed at least twice in our outpatient clinic. We
defined ‘insufficiently controlled’ as ‘suffering from urticaria
for three or more days in a week with daily score more
than three’. Criteria of daily severity score were as stated
below.

Assessments of disease severity

To assess the disease severity, we used the scoring system
proposed by Grattan et al. (7) with a slight modification.
Duration of wheals, number and diameter of wheals, and
degree of itching were scored separately from 0 to 3, or 4.
The summed severity score ranged from 0 to 10. Namely, the
duration of wheals was scored as 0, when wheals did not
appear; 1, when wheals lasted for <2 h; 2, when wheals lasted
for not <2 h, and <12 h; 3, when wheals lasted for 12 h or
longer. The number of wheals was scored as 0, for the condition without any wheals; 1, for 1-4 small (diameter <3 cm)
wheals; 2, for 5-19 small or 1-5 large (©3 cm) wheals; 3, for
20-49 small or 5-19 large wheals; 4, for 50 or more small or
20 or more large wheals. The severity of itch was scored as 0,
none; |, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe.

Treatments

The patients were treated according to ‘a step-by-step treatment for idiopathic urticaria’ described in the guidelines published by Japanese Dermatological Association (8, 9). Details
of the treatment steps are as follows: Step 1 is oral administration of antihistamine. The antihistamine could be switched
to or combined with another one, or simply increased in
dose; Step 2 is the usage of adjunctive agents (histamine H>receptor antagonists, antianxiety medication, Chinese herbal
medicine, leukotriene receptor antagonists, tranexamic acid,
diaminodiphenyl sulfone, etc.); Step 3 is the oral administration of corticosteroids (equivalent to 5-15 mg/day prednisolone); Step 4 are treatments in exploration (cyclosporine,
corticosteroids equivalent to 220 mg/day prednisolone, and
other immunosuppressive or immune-modurative treatments,
etc.).

Criteria for improvement and remission

We defined two outcomes as follows: ‘Improvement’: Patients
suffer from urticaria for not more than three days in a week
with daily score three or less by taking a standard dose or
less dose of an antihistamine without other medications and
‘Remission’: Patients suffer from no symptoms for more than
one month without any medication.

Statistical analysis

Kaplan-Meier curves were applied to demonstrate the
improvement and remission rate. The prognostic factors of
improvement were analyzed by log-rank test and Cox’s multivariate analysis. Analyses were performed by the use of the
SPSS version 15.0J for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL,
USA) and GRAPHPAD PRISM version 5.04 (GraphPad
Software, San Diego, CA, USA). All data are presented as
mean + SEM. This study was carried out in accordance with
the guidelines stated in the Declaration of Helsinki and was
approved by the Ethical Committee of Hiroshima University
Institute of Biomedical & Health Sciences.

Results
Demography

Of the 223 patients who suffered from CSU, 22 patients were
excluded from the study because they had visited our outpatient clinic just once. Of the remaining 201 patients, 84
patients were excluded from this study because they suffered
from urticaria for not more than three days in a week with
daily score three or less by taking a standard or less dose of
an antihistamine without other medication. The remaining
117 patients fulfilled the above-mentioned criteria and had
visited our hospital every 1.2 + 0.2 months on average. Mean
duration of their follow-up at our hospital was
18.7 + 1.9 months. Other detailed demographic data are presented in Table 1. Complications with other types of urticaria
and other allergic diseases in the 117 patients are shown in
Table 2. Thyroid dysfunction was detected in three of 21
patients who undertook thyroid tests.

Treatments

We obtained information about previous treatments for 111
of 117 patients, and 106 (90.6%) patients had been treated
with medications before the first visit to our hospital. Details
of treatment are shown in Table 3.

Improvement and remission rate of CSU

The remission rate increased gradually and _ reached
11.5 + 3.7% at 12 months, 13.9 + 4.3% at 24 months, and
27.7 + 4.3% at 60 months from the first visit (Fig. 1). The
improvement rates were 36.6+5.3% at 12 months,
51.2 45.9% at 24 months, and 66.1 + 7.1% at 60 months.
The improvement rate increased rapidly up to 30 months

21.2 + 6.2 months. Estimated mean disease duration until the
improvement and remission was 40.4+4.7 and
72.3 + 4.7 months, respectively.

Prognostic factors

Gender, age, personal history of atopy, complication with
other types of urticaria, disease duration, and treatment were
analyzed using the log-rank test. We found that age, disease

duration from the onset to the first visit, and treatment steps
were the significant prognostic factors for the improvement.
There was no statistical significance with respect to gender,
history of atopy, the complication of other types of urticaria,
and taking double dose or two types of antihistamines at recommended doses (Table 4, Figure S1). We further analyzed
the four prognostic factors: age, disease duration at the first
visit, treatment steps before and after the first visit by Cox’s
multivariate recurrence analysis, and found that disease duration at the first visit and treatment steps after the first visit
were independent prognostic factors of the improvement

(Table 5). The odds ratios of the patients who were 19 years
old or more were lower than those of the patients who were
younger than 19 years, although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.052).

Discussion

In this study, we investigated the clinical course of intractable
CSU in patients who visited our hospital. The demographic
data suggested that the patients with CSU were mainly
women and many of their ages of onset were from 20s to
40s. At the first visit, 18 patients (15.4%) had been suffering
from CSU for more than 5 years. These results revealed that
a subpopulation of the patients was suffering from CSU for
an extremely long duration.

The remission rates of CSU at | and 5 years estimated in
this study (11.5%, 27.7%) were lower than those in other
studies, 16.5-47.4% at 1 year (10-13) and 34-88.7% at
5 years (5, 6, 10-12). One of the big differences between these
studies and ours is in terms of objectives and methods. We
investigated patients with face-to-face consultations in hospital and analyzed the remission rate by the Kaplan—Meier
method, whereas most of other studies used telephone or
questionnaires and did not calculate the remission rates considering dropout subjects with Kaplan—Meier analysis. Moreover, we excluded the patients who entered remission
following a standard dose of antihistamine. Therefore, the
difference in remission rate might imply that the prognosis of
urticaria that was not controlled by using a standard dose of
antihistamine within 6 weeks may be worse than urticaria
that promptly disappeared either spontaneously or by using a
standard dose of antihistamine.

Along with ‘Remission’, we defined the ‘Improvement’ as the
condition of patients who suffered from urticaria with daily
score three or less for not more than three days in a week by
taking a standard or less dose of an antihistamine without other

 

medications. The improvement rate at 2 years, 51.2%, appeared

to be satisfactorily high as compared with the remission rate at
the same time. The considerably higher rate of the improvement
than that of the remission of CSU could encourage physicians
to maintain good medication adherence of patients.

We also investigated the relationships between factors of
the patients and the improvement of their symptoms by logrank test and Cox’s multivariate analysis. The one-year
improvement rate in patients under 19 years old, 56.8%, was
significantly higher than that in adults, 35.4% by long-rank
test. Sahiner et al. (11) studied 100 patients with CSU who
were not older than 19 years old and revealed that 50% of
them became symptom-free within 5 years. They also showed
that the prognosis of female patients aged 10 or more was
worse than that of the other children groups. Because the
incidence of CSU in childhood urticaria is, in general, smaller than that in adult urticaria (14, 15), information on the
prognosis of childhood CSU is quite limited. In fact, the

Figure 1 Improvement and remission rate from the first visit to
our hospital (n = 117). We defined ‘Improvement’ as patients suffer from urticaria in not more than three days a week with daily
score three or less by taking a standard or less dose of an antihistamine without other medications, and ‘Remission’ as patients suffered from no symptom for more than one month without any
medication. These data were estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods.

number of patients who were younger than 19 years old in
our study was only 14 of 117. With Cox’s multivariate analysis, however, we could not find a significant difference
between the improvement of CSU in patients aged <19 years
and that in patients aged 19 years or more (P = 0.052). It
might be due to insufficient number of patients under
19 years old in this analysis. Further studies in a larger population are necessary to predict precise figure of prognosis
for pediatric patients.

Several previous reports (6, 16) have pointed out that the
remission rate decreases as urticaria persists. In agreement
with these studies, we also found that the disease duration at
the first visit was critical for prognosis by both log-rank test
and Cox’s multivariate analysis.

The relationship between disease severities at the first visit
and their prognosis is of great interest. However, we could
not use our scoring system to evaluate disease severities at
the first visit, because almost all subjects had already been
treated with various medications by that time. Alternatively,
we investigated the medications before and after their first
visit. The improvement rate of the patients who had been
treated by Step 2 or less medications before the first visit
was higher than that of the patients who had been already
treated by Step 3 or more. Similarly, symptoms of the
patients who had been treated with Step 1 or 2 medications
in our hospital improved faster than those of the patients
treated with Step 3 or 4 (Table 3). However, Cox’s multivariate analysis reveals no statistical significance between the
treatment steps before the first visit. This result suggests that
the treatment steps before the first visit may reflect other
prognostic factors, such as disease duration at the first visit.

Clinical course of chronic spontaneous urticaria

In fact, the patients who were treated by Step 3 or 4 medications before the first visit had been suffered from urticaria
longer than the patients who treated by Step 2 or less medications at the first visit.

Previous reports (12, 17) showed that the remission rate of
patients who suffered from both wheals and angioedema
after 1 year was lower than that of patients who exhibited
wheals without angioedema (64-70% vs 43-48%). In contrast, our study revealed that the complication of angioedema
was not related to the prognosis. This difference might be
either due to a lower population (11.1%) of patients with angioedema included in our study as compared with other
reports from European countries (40%, 33%) (16, 18). Alternatively, we speculate that it might be due to a difference in
genetic background of urticaria and angioedema between
Europe and Asia.

Finally, the influence of treatments on the natural course
of urticaria is a matter of deep interest. However, the population in this study is too small and heterogeneous to evaluate
that aspect. Grob et al. (19) compared the effect of continuous daily therapy with an antihistamine, desloratadine, and
on-demand treatment with desloratadine on symptoms return
(PRN) on chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), which had been
controlled for four weeks by desloratadine. The quality of life
(QoL) of patients treated with daily continuous desloratadine
was better than that treated by PRN. However, there was no
significant difference in QoL between two groups in the follow-up period when all patients took PRN. No other study
about the prognosis of urticaria has analyzed the effect of
medications on the natural course of CSU. Thus, prospective
studies of medical interventions on the natural course of urticaria should be performed with adequate classifications of
patients based on this study.

In this study, we clarified the remission and improvement
rates, and factors associated with prognosis of intractable
cases of CSU. Our findings provide basic information to predict the natural course of refractory CSU and to maintain
patients’ compliance with the treatments. Differences between
our results and those in previous reports, mainly from European countries, suggest that the observations of urticaria and
angioedema in European patients could not directly apply to
Japanese and possibly other Asian patients. Further studies
of CSU should be performed, considering the factors related
to the prognosis shown in this study.
