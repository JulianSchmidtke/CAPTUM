Introduction

Abstract

Background A positive autologous serum skin test (ASST) is considered
to reflect the presence of anti-FceRI and/or anti-IgE autoantibodies that
are capable of activating mast and basophil cell degranulation. The ASST is
regarded as a reliable in vivo test in chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) patients,
with diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic implications. However, positive
ASST results have also occasionally been demonstrated in patients with other
diseases and in healthy subjects.

Objective To evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of the ASST in a cohort of
CIU patients compared to a cohort of respiratory-allergic patients and a group
of normal individuals.

Methods ASST was performed in a cohort of 116 subjects, 47 subjects with
seasonal allergic rhinitis, 32 respiratory-symptom-free CIU patients, and 37
healthy individuals.

Results The results were compared statistically to those of the CIU patients.
The intradermal injection of autologous serum induced a weal and flare
reaction in 17/32 (53.1%) CIU patients; 14/47 (29.8%) patients with seasonal
allergic rhinitis (P= 0.06) and in 15/37 (40.5%) of the healthy controls
(P = 0.34). The sensitivity and specificity of the ASST in the CIU patients and
the seasonal allergic rhinitis patients was 53 and 28%, respectively. When
comparing the CIU patients with the healthy controls the sensitivity and
specificity was 55 and 31%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive
values of the ASST when comparing CIU patients with healthy controls were
53 and 59.5%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values of the
ASST in the CIU patients compared to seasonal allergic rhinitis patients were 53
and 70%, respectively.

Conclusion The relatively low sensitivity and specificity of the ASST in the
CIU patients compared to the seasonal allergic rhinitis patients and healthy
controls warrants a more critical interpretation of the ASST in chronic
idiopathic urticaria.

In 70-80% of patients no apparent cause is identifiable.”
Chronic idiopathic urticaria is a common skin disorder

Urticaria is a common skin disorder, affecting 15-25%
of the population at least once in a lifetime.! Chronic
urticaria (CU) is defined as widespread, transient (< 24 h)
weals occurring daily or almost daily for at least 6 weeks.”*

affecting at least 0.1% of the population, with an average
duration of 3—5 years in adults.* The pathogenesis of CIU
is not completely understood.! In 1986, the presence of
a serum factor which caused weals upon autologous

intradermal injection (i.e. autologous serum skin test,
ASST) was reported by Grattan etal.’ in a subset of
patients with CIU. In 1993, an autoimmune aetiology of
CIU was suggested by Hide etal.> They identified the
presence of IgG anti-high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI)
and anti-IgE autoantibodies capable of activating mast cell
and basophil degranulation in the sera of CIU patients.’
Circulating autoantibodies against IgE or against FceRI
were found in 30-60% of patients with CIU.* The mast
cell-specific histamine-releasing assay (HRA) allows the in
vitro functional detection of anti-FceRI, anti-IgE or other
histamine-releasing factors.? Using HRA, sera from CIU
patients were shown to induce histamine release from
normal basophils in vitro.'°

Using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
and immunoblot techniques, autoantibodies to FceRI
have been found not only in CIU patients, but also in
normal individuals, as well as in therapeutic intravenous
immunoglobulin (IVIG) units.”

It appears that the use of ELISA and immunoblotting
techniques is not specific for detection of functional
autoantibodies in chronic urticaria.*

In clinical practice, a positive ASST has been used as a
proxy for the measurement of functional autoantibodies
to FceRI, and it is assumed to be suggestive of an autoimmune pathogenesis of urticaria.” The ASST is an in vivo
validated test performed by injecting the patient’s own
serum into the skin, and by reflecting CIU autoreactivity.?*®
A weal and flare reaction will develop in 30-67% of
patients, particularly during the active phases of the
disease.'° A correlation between the presence of anti-FceRI
and anti-IgE autoantibodies and positive autologous
serum skin test (ASST) was documented.”’ In addition, an
association was indicated between ASST and CIU severity
and duration.?* Nevertheless, there is a concern about
possible false positive results due to the formation of other
vasoactive mediators while the serum is being processed,
and false negative results due to degradation of histaminereleasing factors.

A recent study failed to demonstrate that patients
with a positive ASST had a more severe urticaria.'° It was
also demonstrated that skin reactivity to ASST is not
necessarily due to IgG autoantibodies against IgE and/
or FceRI.'' These autoantibodies were also found in
patients with non-idiopathic urticaria; in patients
affected by other diseases, and in normal subjects.!?
The ASST in non-CIU chronic diseases or in healthy subjects was only rarely positive,?*' although recently the
ASST was shown to have the same percentage of positive
reactions in CIU patients (58%) in respiratory-allergy
patients (57.9%), and in as many as 45% of healthy
controls.!* Therefore, a more critical interpretation of
the ASST was advocated.”

The present study was performed to further elucidate the
diagnostic usefulness of ASST in idiopathic CIU patients by
comparing test results with those of respiratory-allergy
patients and normal individuals.

Patients and methods

Patient selection

This prospective study included 47 subjects with seasonal
allergic rhinitis (24 women and 23 men; mean age: 32.7 +
13.5 years), and a cohort of 32 respiratory-symptom-free
CIU patients (23 women and 9 men; mean age: 38.4 +
14.5 years). A control group consisting of 37 healthy adult
subjects was also included (26 women and 11 men; mean
age: 39.3 + 12.2 years). The criteria for the clinical diagnosis
of suspected allergic rhinitis were compatible with those
suggested in the ARIA document.’® Patients with a
documented history of seasonal allergic rhinitis during the
pollen season for at least 2 years prior to the study were
included. Patients were eligible for inclusion in the study
after confirmation of seasonal allergic rhinitis by skin
prick tests for a panel of 40 inhalant allergens (ALKAbell6, Inc., Round Rock, TX, USA). The skin tests were
considered positive if the diameter of the skin response
was2>5mm greater than that of the saline control.
Patients with skin tests positive to olive pollen and/or mix
of eight southern grasses, which correlated to the patient’s
seasonal history, were included in the study. All CIU
patients reported daily or almost daily symptoms of
urticaria, lasting for at least 6 weeks. The urticaria patients
were chosen among a group of patients that was referred
to the hospital with recurrent, transitory, itchy weals for
more than 6 weeks. Patients with associated physical
urticaria and/or dermographism were excluded. Our
hospital is a tertiary referral hospital, so all the patients
had a severe CIU that was causing significant disruption of
their personal, occupational or social life.

The CIU patients did not show any clinical symptoms of
vasculitis, food allergy or intolerance, contact allergy,
bacterial or parasitic infections, and underwent a laboratory
workup, which included a complete blood count and
chemistry panel, anti-thyroid antibodies, antinuclear
antibodies, rheumatic factor, cryoglobulins, urine and
throat cultures, stool culture for parasites and stool
guaiac, and chest X-rays. The workup was negative except
for one patient with positive cryoglobulins and seven
patients that displayed anti-thyroid antibodies, three of
which also had an autoimmune disease of the thyroid.
The other four did not display any symptoms of autoimmune diseases. The CIU patients were also tested with a
panel of food and inhalant allergens. CIU patients underwent prick tests with the same panel of inhalant allergens

that was used for the allergic rhinitis patients. In addition,
the CIU patients were prick tested with a panel of food
allergens adapted for Israel, which included peanut, banana,
milk, egg, oat, almond, peach, cow meat, chicken meat,
cinnamon, nut, fish, mustard, strawberries, tuna, vanilla,
tomato, soya, orange, wheat, sesame, avocado, corn, seafood, and black pepper. Only the CIU patients with
negative prick tests results to food and inhalant allergens
were included in the present study.

The healthy controls and patients with seasonal allergic
rhinitis did not present any personal history of autoimmune diseases.

The study was approved by the hospital’s local ethics
committee and all subjects provided written informed
consent. Antihistamine therapy was discontinued 1 week
before skin testing in all cases. None of the participants in
the study was taking corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs at the time of the evaluation.

The ASST was applied to all study participants as follows: venous blood was drawn into sterile 10-mL vacuum
tubes, without a clot accelerator (Vacutainer, Becton
Dickinson, NJ, USA), and allowed to clot at room temperature for 30 min. The serum was separated by centrifugation at 550g for 15 min, and cell-free supernatant was
collected under sterile conditions immediately before its
use. 0.05 mL of fresh undiluted sterile autologous serum
alone and 0.05 mL of physiological saline solution were
injected, each intradermally, into the participant’s forearm. The reactions were evaluated after 30 min. A weal
with a diameter of at least 1.5 mm greater than that of the
control weal induced with the saline solution was
recorded as positive.? The ASSTs were performed and read
by two of the investigators (EGY and ES).

Statistical analysis

Data were analysed using SPSS (Statistics Products
Solutions Services) for Windows. The association between

categorical groups was analysed using the Chi-square test
and Fisher’s exact test. The Student's t-test was applied to
compare the age distribution among the different groups.
Sensitivity of the ASST was calculated by the proportion
of the truly diseased persons in the screened population
that were also identified as having the disease by the
screening test. Specificity of the ASST was calculated by
the proportion of the genuinely non-diseased persons that
were also identified as not having the disease by the
screening test.

A two-tailed P-value of 0.05 or less was accepted as statistically significant.

Results

A cohort of 116 subjects was examined (32 patients with
CIU, 47 with allergic rhinitis, and 37 healthy subjects).
The age of patients ranged between 18 and 54 years, with
amale to female ratio of 0.4 (9/23), 1.04 (24/23), and 0.42
(11/26) in the CIU, allergic rhinitis and healthy patients,
respectively. A demographic distribution of the entire
cohort examined is presented in Table 1.

The intradermal injection of autologous serum induced
a weal and flare reaction in 17/32 (53.1%) of patients
with CIU compared to 14/47 (29.8%) of the patients with
seasonal allergic rhinitis (P = 0.06), and to 15/37 (40.5%)
of the healthy controls (P = 0.34) (fig. 1). The injection of
saline solution did not elicit any reaction in the patients or
healthy individuals. No difference was observed between
the genders. Anti-thyroid antibodies were demonstrated
in seven of the CIU patients, with only three of them
displaying a positive ASST, implying a lack of a correlation
between anti-thyroid antibodies, and/or autoimmune
diseases and ASST positivity.

The sensitivity and specificity of the ASST when
comparing the CIU patients and the seasonal allergic
rhinitis patients was 53 and 28%, respectively. When
comparing CIU patients with healthy controls, the sensitivity

Discussion

Intradermal injection of autologous serum (ASST) causes
a weal and flare in 30-60% of patients with CIU, which
demonstrates that sera from CIU patients may induce
histamine release activity (HRA) in normal basophils in
vitro.'! HRA has been shown to be associated with specific
IgG or IgM antibodies against the high affinity FCeRI
present on mast cells and basophils or against circulating
Igk.49.13-15

The ASST has been used as a proxy measurement for in
vivo functional autoantibodies against FCeRI. However,
studies have not always shown a good correlation between
ASST results and the presence of functional autoantibodies
in vitro.“'' Only approximately 50% of CIU patients that
demonstrate a positive (ASST) appear to have a HRA
by the in vitro assay.*'! ASST is widely used as a clinical
means of identifying autoimmune urticaria from other
forms of chronic urticaria. Several studies demonstrated
that patients with autoantibodies against the FCeRI or
IgE suffered from a more severe urticaria than patients
without these antibodies.'”'* The plasma levels of these
autoantibodies varied according to the activity of the
disease!’ and removal of the antibodies by plasmapheresis
resulted in remission of the urticaria.'? Confirmation of
the diagnosis of autoimmune chronic urticaria (AIUC) has
major treatment implications. Patients with a confirmed

38

Guttman-Yassky et al.

diagnosis of AIUC are usually more treatment-resistant,
and their disease runs a more aggressive course than those
with a non-AIUC.'” However, the sensitivity and specificity
the ASST was 65-81 and 71-78%, respectively.?
Previous studies found an absence or rarely-positive ASST
in healthy control subjects.**!> However, Mari et al.’° and
the present study indicate a positive ASST in 29.8-47%
of patients with allergy-like respiratory symptoms and in
40.5-45% of healthy control individuals.'? Miescher
etal.” detected the existence of a major IgM clone that
produces autoantibodies against FCeRI both in chronic
iopathic urticaria patients having an active disease and
in normal donors. These autoantibodies recognize the
FCeRI on cells but are not anaphylactogenic on blood
basophils, except when IgE is removed from the receptor.
They proposed a concept of ‘conditional autoimmunity’
where natural anti-FceRI autoantibodies can become
pathogenic, depending on the state of occupancy of the
FceRI by its natural IgE ligand.”° It could be that this test
is important in identifying subsets in the general population, and in atopic individuals that are prone to develop
allergic diseases, and is not specific for defining patients
with autoimmune urticaria. This would explain the high
frequency of positive responses to the ASST in the group
of seasonal allergic rhinitis patients. Anti-FceRIa antibodies
were reported in four out of 10 asthmatic subjects, in part
capable of inducing histamine release from basophils,”’
and functional anti-IgE antibodies were demonstrated in
asthmatic patients.** Thus, the hypothesis that a common
autoreactive mechanism could underlie the activation of
mast cells in different tissues, causing different clinical
symptoms resembling an allergy disease, must be considered.'? Different serum factors can contribute to the
heterogeneity of symptom patterns observed among
patients. Our reported findings in both CIU patients, allergic
rhinitis patients and normal donors, can lead to a different
interpretation of the positive ASST in healthy subjects.
The chronic activation of mast cells could lead to an
increasing expression of the allergy phenotype either as
direct expression of symptoms (release of mediators) or
indirectly by enhancing the risk of developing an IgEmediated disease (release of Th2 cytokines). Until a
reliable method becomes available, the ASST could represent
a valid diagnostic approach to all allergy/allergy-like
conditions.'!> Cutaneous and respiratory symptoms may
possibly reflect the corresponding activation of mast cells
in different tissues. In the general population, ASST
positivity may define a risk factor for reactive healthy
subjects, prone to allergy/allergy-like diseases. Follow-up
studies are needed to define the role of ASST in atopic
individuals.

In the present study, we have demonstrated a 53.1%
prevalence of positive ASST among CIU patients, which is

within the range found in previous studies.'° However,
we have also demonstrated a relatively high prevalence of
positive ASST reactivity in 29.8% of patients with
seasonal allergic rhinitis and in 40.5% of healthy controls,
which resulted in relatively low sensitivity, specificity,
and predictive values for the ASST test in CIU. It has been
suggested that a positive ASST in CIU patients should be
confirmed by in vitro testing of HRA.*' Unfortunately, the
basophil HRA is difficult to standardize, as it is confined to
research or reference laboratories,” and must be correlated
with the clinical data.**1”"*

In conclusion, the relatively high prevalence of positive
ASST among non-CIU patients makes the diagnostic validity
and usefulness of the test questionable in autoimmune
urticaria.
