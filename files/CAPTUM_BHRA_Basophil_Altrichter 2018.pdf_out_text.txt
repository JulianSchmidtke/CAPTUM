Abstract

Background: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a frequent disorder with recurrent itchy
wheals and/or angioedema. Despite the known effectiveness of omalizumab therapy, the
relevant IgE antigens are largely unknown. Recently, increased rates of elevated levels of

IgE towards Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins (SEs) were described in CSU.

Aim: To assess the prevalence and functional relevance of IgE to SEs in CSU.

Method: We investigated serum levels of IgE against SEs in 49 CSU patients and in 15 CSU
patients additional specific IgE to SE components and basophil histamine release (BHR).

Sera of 15 healthy controls (HCs) served as control group.

Results: 25 (51%) of the CSU patients had detectable levels of SE-lgE as compared to 5
(33%) of HCs. Specific IgE to one of the SEs, Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB), was

present in 5 (33%) of 15 randomly selected CSU patients vs 3 (20%) of HC. Total IgE serum

levels in CSU patients were significantly correlated with SE-IgE (r = 0.52, p<0.001) and SEBIgE (r = 0.54, p = 0.04) serum concentrations. Interestingly, SEB-IgE levels were strongly
correlated with disease activity (UASday) in CSU patients (r=0.657, p=0.01). Furthermore,
BHR in response to SEB was significantly higher in basophils loaded with the serum of CSU
patients compared to HC (p<0.05) and was clinically correlated with duration of disease (r

>0.51, p <0.05).

Discussion: IgE against SEs may contribute to the pathogenesis of CSU in a subpopulation
of patients Its role and relevance in the pathophysiology of CSU needs to be further

analysed.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a frequent and disabling disease characterized by
recurrent itchy wheals and/or angioedema that result from the activation of cutaneous mast
cells (MCs) [1]. The results of recent studies of the underlying etiopathogenesis of CSU
suggest that two types of signals, MC secretagogues and MC modulators, are important for
the activation of skin MCs in CSU [2]. MC secretagogues induce MC degranulation, the
process that leads to the development of CSU signs and symptoms. MC modulators change
the susceptibility of MCs to the effects of MC secretagogues, by lowering or increasing the
MC threshold to respond with degranulation [3]. The effects of MC priming by these
threshold modifiers, together with those of MC secretagogues, result in the release of
histamine and other proinflammatory mediators by skin MCs, which induce subsequent
vasodilatation and extravasation as well as and nerve activation, resulting in the typical itchy

wheal and flare type reactions.

Several independent lines of evidence suggest that IgE, via its high affinity IgE
receptor, FceRI, is the major MC secretagogue in CSU: i) Total IgE is elevated in CSU, and

CSU patients have a higher prevalence of elevated IgE levels as compared to controls [4, 5].

ii) The activation of skin MCs via IgE and its receptor leads to urticaria signs and symptoms,
e.g. in skin prick testing, as a side effect of specific immunotherapy, or in acute allergic
urticaria [6, 7]. iii) Treatment with Omalizumab, a monoclonal humanized anti-IgE antibody,

is very effective in CSU [8, 9].

MCs degranulate when FceRIs on their cell surface aggregate and crosslink. This
happens when two or more FceRI-bound IgE molecules that are all specific for the same
antigen bind this allergen, a pollen allergen for example [10]. Allergen-induced IgE/FceRImediated MC degranulation is the hallmark pathogenic feature of type | allergies, such as
allergic rhinoconjunctivitis [11, 12]. CSU, in contrast is not a classical allergy and typical
exoallergens are not involved in the degranulation of MCs in CSU. As of yet, the antigens to
which CSU-relevant IgEs are specific, are largely unknown. Although specific IgE against
classical common allergens, i.e. aeroallergens and food allergens [13-16], or to less
common allergens such as fungi [5, 17] can be detected in some patients with CSU, they are
not regarded as pathophysiological relevant for the development of the signs and symptoms
of CSU [14, 15, 18-20]. Autoallergens might be the targets for the IgE molecules in CSU, but

there is very little evidence as of yet to support this [21-23].

What could be the specific targets of the IgE that induces skin MC degranulation in
CSU patients? Some older studies [24, 25] have shown that bacterial antigens may be the
target of IgE, and that MCs with antibacterial IgE on their surface IgE receptors degranulate

when exposed to IgE-specific bacterial antigens such as staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs).

Indeed, IgE to staphylococcus toxins has been demonstrated to be elevated and
linked to disease activity and exacerbation in several MC-driven diseases including atopic
dermatitis [26], nasal polyposis and allergic rhinitis [27, 28]. Leung et al. [29] have
demonstrated that 57% of patients with atopic dermatitis have serum IgE against
staphylococcal toxins and that their basophils release histamine upon exposure to the

relevant SEs. Sharma et al reported that antibacterial treatment reduced urticaria symptoms

in colonized patients with chronic urticaria [30].

Most interestingly, Ye and co-workers detected an increased prevalence of specific
IgE against staphylococcal enterotoxin A and B and toxic shock syndrome toxin TSST-1
(13.7%, 12.0% and 18.0%, respectively) in Korean patients with chronic urticaria, and
described associations with aspirin sensitivity, elevated total IgE serum levels, higher rates
of atopy and specific HLA haplotypes (HLA DQB1*0609 and DRB1*1302) [31]. Recently a
second study of the same group described, in a larger cohort of Korean patients, increased
rates of IgE against SE. These where significantly elevated for SEB and TSST-1 compared
to healthy controls (SEA 10.0% vs. 6.1%, n.s.; SEB 21.3% vs. 6.3%, p<0.001; and TSST-1

26.75% vs. 12.3%, p<0.001) [32].

In this study, we wanted to confirm these findings in Caucasian CSU patients and address

the question if the IgE against SE is functional and relevant in CSU.

Materials and Methods

Study subjects

In this retrospective study, 49 sera of CSU patients from the Department of Dermatology and
Allergy, Charité - Universitatsmedizin, Berlin were analyzed and correlated with clinical
parameter of the patients. 15 healthy control sera were analyzed in the study. Study
subjects’ details are given in Table 1. Patient sera and data used for this study were
exclusively derived from the blood obtained for the routine clinical management of patient
and their medical chart documentation, respectively. None of the enrolled participants had
taken systemic corticosteroids or applied topical antihistamines, corticosteroids or mast-cell
stabilizers for 2 weeks and not taken oral antihistamines at least 72 hours prior to routine

assessment.

Questionnaire

Patients were asked to keep a symptom diary and to document, every day, their itch score
(0= none, 1= mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe) and their numbers of wheals (0O= none, 1= little
intensity, 2= moderate intensity, 3= severe intensity), in order to assess their disease
severity. By adding these scores the weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7, range 0-42) of the
last seven days before blood drawing were calculated. As 32% of the CSU had taken
second generation antihistamines (median 2 Tabl.) in the week before blood drawing, we
also calculated the daily urticaria activity score (UASday, range 0-6) on the day of blood

drawing, where the patients had stopped AH treatment at least 72h before.

Autologous serum skin test (ASST)

The ASST was routinely performed in CSU patients as described before [33]. The ASST was
regarded positive if a serum-induced weal occurred with a diameter of >/= 1.5 mm bigger

than the saline-induced response at 30 min.

Serum analysis

By using the Immuno CAP System Phadia Laboratory Systems, Thermo Fisher Scientific

Inc, Uppsala, Sweden, the following parameters were determined:

e — total-IgE

Staphylococcus specific:

e — slgE Staphyloccocus enterotoxin B (m81)

e SE-lgEs (URL, Ghent University, not commercially available)

Total IgE levels >100 kU/I were considered as elevated (as given in the manual of Immuno

CAP). Detection level of SE-IgE was 0.1kU/I.

Basophil histamine release (BHR)

15 randomly selected CSU sera (8 SE-IgE detectable, 7 SE-IgE below detection limit; 5
SEB-IgE detectable, 10 SEB-IgE below detection limit) were used for BHR. Clinical
characteristics of the randomly selected CSU patients did not differ from the whole 49 CSU

patients (see Supplemental Table 1)

Passive sensitization was performed using heparinized blood from the same single healthy
non-allergic donor, with the following characteristics: 1. confirmed strong reaction to anti-IgE
(histamine released: 52 + 5 ng/mL) and 2. No response to SEA or SEB. To remove the IgE
bound from the basophils surface, 3 mL of blood samples were treated with 10 mL of
stripping buffer (0.14 M NaCl, 0.005 M KCI and 0.0134 M lactic acid) for 10 min at 4°C.
Thereafter the cells were washed with PIPES buffer (10 mM piperazine-N,N(bis-ethane
sulfonic acid), 140 mM sodium acetate, 5 mM potassium acetate, 0.6 mM CaCl, 1.1 mM
MgClo, 1 mg/mL glucose, 0.3 mg/mL HSA, 15 IE/mL heparin) and resuspended to a total
volume of 3 mL in the PIPES buffer. Then, 130 pL of sera from patients or controls were
incubated with 3 mL of the “IgE-stripped” donor blood for 60 min at 37°C. Aliquots of 25 uL
of passively sensitized blood in the presence of IL-3 (2 ng/mL blood) were incubated in the
glass fibre-prepared microtiter plates (RefLab ApS, Copenhagen, Denmark), with 25 ul of
SEA or SEB at a concentration of 100 and 30 g/mL for 60 min at 37°C. The SEA and SEB
concentration chosen for this test were the highest values that did not lead to unspecific
histamine release in a dose-response curve. This level corresponded to the mean + 3 x SD

of the histamine release values measured in 5 non-allergic subjects without a specific

stimulus. As a positive control of the passive sensitization was used 25 ul of anti-IgE (KPL,

USA, MD) in a concentration of 5 pg/mL.

After incubation, the microtiter plate was washed with H2O for 1 min to remove cells and
interfering substances. Thereafter, 75 yl of NaOH/ortho-phtaldialdehyde (OPA) mixture was
added to each well allowing glass fiber bound histamine to be released and coupled to OPA.
After 10 min the coupling reaction was stopped and histamine-OPA complexes stabilised by
adding 75 ul of 0.59% HClO... Histamine was determined fluorometrically in the
Histareader™ 501 manufacturing company (RefLab). Results were expressed as ng/mL of

histamine released.

Statistical Analyses

Statistical analysis was performed using Graph Pad Prism Version 6 for Windows, 2012.
D'Agostino & Pearson omnibus normality test was used to test for normal distribution.
Parametric data are depicted using mean and standard error of mean values, non
parametric data using median and (interquartile) range.

Binominal variables were analyzed using Chi-square test. Parametric variables were
compared using unpaired t-test. Non-parametric continuous variables were compared using
Mann-Whitney test. Correlations were calculated using the Spearman’s rank test. P < 0.05

was considered to indicate statistical significance.

Results

In CSU patients, total IgE levels are elevated, but specific IgE levels against staphylococcal

enterotoxin are comparable to those of healthy controls.

In our study, CSU patients had significantly elevated levels of total IgE (median 95 kU/I) as
compared to healthy control subjects (median 29.5 kU/I, p=0.026, Figure 1a). We also found
specific IgE against a mix of staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) in the blood of 51% of CSU
patients versus 33% of healthy controls, but IgE-anti-SE-levels were not significantly higher

in the CSU group as compared to the healthy control group (Figure 1b).

Specific IgE to one of the SEs, Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB), was present in 33% of
CSU patients vs 20% of healthy controls. Again, the median serum levels in CSU patients

and healthy controls were comparable (Figure 1b).

Detectable specific IgE against staphylococcal enterotoxins are significantly correlated with

total IgE serum levels.

SE-IgE serum concentrations were significantly correlated with total IgE serum levels in
both, CSU and healthy controls (CSU: r = 0.52, p<0.001, healthy: r = 0.74, p = 0.002). In
contrast, SEB-IgE and total IgE were significantly correlated only in CSU patients (r = 0.54, p
= 0.04), but not in healthy controls (r = 0.39, p = 0.155). In both populations, SEB-IgE was

correlated very well with SE-IgE (r = 0.87, p < 0.001).

In CSU patients, levels of SEB-IgE, but not SE-IgE, correlate with disease activity.

In CSU, SE-IgE did not correlate with any assessed clinical features such as duration of
disease, disease activity (determined by UASday or UAS7) or ASST/APST-wheal diameter

(Table 2a). In contrast, SEB-IgE levels were strongly correlated with disease activity

(UASday) in CSU patients (Rs=0.657, p=0.01, Table 2b). Interestingly, most CSU patients
with elevated SEB-IgE levels were ASST negative (80%). The significant correlation of SEBIgE with disease activity (UASday) was pronounced in ASST negative CSU patients
(Rs=0.702, p=0.043, n=9) but absent in ASST positive patients (Rs=0.791, p=0.400, n=5).

There was no significant correlation with the UAS7 score.

SEB-IgE from CSU patients induces basophil histamine release

When we exposed donor basophils first to the serum of 15 randomly selected CSU patients
or healthy control sera and then to SEB, histamine release was significantly more
pronounced in the basophils sensitized with CSU sera (Figure 2a-c). SEB-induced histamine
release was significantly correlated with levels of total IgE and with the disease duration in

CSU patients (see Table 3).

Basophil exposure to SEA or TSST-1 did not result in histamine release neither in basophils

sensitized with the serum of CSU patients nor healthy controls (data not shown).

Discussion

This study shows that many CSU patients have IgE to staphylococcal toxins. The levels of
IgE to one of these toxins, SEB, are correlated with total IgE levels and CSU activity. Also,
the SEB-specific IgE of CSU patients has histamine-releasing effects, which are linked to

disease activity and duration.

CSU patients frequently have IgE against staphylococcal enterotoxins

In comparison to the study of Ye et al. in Korean CSU patients (31.8%) [31] we detected a

higher prevalence of about 50% sIgE against staphylococcal enterotoxins in our Caucasian

CSU patients. In this study also, the healthy controls had lower prevalences (13%)
compared to our study (33%). In comparison to this publication we also detected more
frequently IgE against Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB). Compared to the study of Ye et
al. it was present in 33% of our CSU patients (compared to 12%) vs 20% of healthy controls
(compared to 4.3%). To our knowledge it is not known if Asians overall have lower sIgE
against staphylococcal enterotoxins rates compared to Caucasians. As in both studies the
same test system had been used, these differences are not the result of different test

sensitivities.

The mean levels of specific IgE against staphylococcal enterotoxins including SEB was not
significantly higher compared to the healthy control groups (Figure 1b). If looking at the
specific IgE levels in the positive CSU patients and healthy controls, we did see higher sIgE
levels in CSU patients (SE-IgE mean 0.84 kU/I 0.14 compared to 0.49 kU/I +0.08 in healthy
controls; SEB-IgE mean 0.65 kU/I + 0.05 compared to 0.32 kU/I + 0.06 in healthy), but this
differences missed statistical significance, due to the low number of patients. Ye et al. in

comparison did not report the levels of IgE against staphylococcal enterotoxins.

Our results confirm earlier studies showing that CSU patients have elevated serum levels of
total IgE [4, 5, 21, 34]. Comparative to other studies [35-37], we also saw in our study a
trend to more frequent detectable levels against perennial or seasonal inhalant antigens as
compared to healthy controls (see Supplemental Table 1). The highest detection rates had
been described for house dust mite allergens [13, 14, 16], for which we could also detect
specific IgE in almost half of our patients. In line with a previous study [14], overall the
prevalence was not significantly different to those of healthy controls (see Supplemental
Figure 1). The clinical significance of these specific IgE antibodies is still not clear. In the
literature these sensitisations are mostly regarded as irrelevant to CSU symptoms [15, 18
20].

Aspirin intolerance has not been assessed in our patient population. Previously, chronic
urticaria patients with aspririn intolerance [31], aspirin intolerant patients with nasal polyposis
[38] and aspirin intolerant asthma patients [39], have been reported to show higher rates of
specific IgE to superantigens. Thereasons for this are not completely understood yet. None
of the studies was able to provide evidence for a direct link between IgE to Staphylococcus

aureus and aspirin intolerance, and further studies are needed.

IN CSU, IgE-anti-SEB is linked to total IgE and disease activity

In line with the paper Ye et al. [31] we also detected a correlation of SE-IgE and SEB-IgE
with the total IgE levels. This fact, that serum IgE-anti-SEB levels in CSU patients were
strongly correlated to total IgE levels, suggests that the elevation of total IgE in CSU may be

explained, at least in part, by the production of IgE to SEB and other bacterial antigens.

As of now it is largely unclear why CSU patients have elevated total IgE levels. In some
publications IgE against classical common allergens, i.e. aeroallergens and food allergens
[13-16], or to less common allergens such as fungi [5, 17] had been detected in some
patients with CSU. Nevertheless, they are not regarded as pathophysiological relevant for
the development of the signs and symptoms of CSU [14, 15, 18-20], as the symptoms occur
independently of exoallergen contact. This is in contrast to contact urticaria, where
symptoms occur (immediately) upon contact and can be detected via BHR [40]. We have
shown in a former publication that some CSU patients do have IgE against autoantigens
such as TPO [21]. How these autoreactive IgE molecules evolve in CSU is unknown. It can
be speculated that they develop as a result of cross-reactivity e.g. after infectious diseases,
as infections are a common cause of acute and chronic urticaria [41]. Staphylococcus
aureus is a common skin colonizing bacteria known for causing various infectious diseases.

Accordingly, Staphylococcus aureus specific antibodies including IgE might occur as a result

of such infections, which then might lead to the development of allergic symptoms, as seen

in CSU.

That IgE-anti-SEB levels are correlated with disease activity in CSU patients indicates this
specific IgE may contribute to the mast cell degranulation occurring in CSU skin. Neither SEIgE nor SEB-IgE were correlated with ASST positive reactivity, suggesting that sensitisations
to staphylococcal antigens are not associated with autoreactivity in CSU. In contrast,
elevated SEB-IgE levels were more often seen in ASST negative patients and in this
subpopulation the correlation with the UASday was significant, in contrast to the ASST
positive population, probably indicating that SEB-IgE can be a driver of disease in the nonautoreactive patient population. SEB-IgE did not correlate with the UAS7 in our CSU
patients, but in this tested selected population, 27.7% of the patients had taken
antihistamines in the week before blood drawing, probably affecting the UAS7 score, thus

leading to missed correlations due to a low total patient number.

Interestingly, the sensitisation against staphylococcal antigens seemed to have developed
irrespective of the sensitisations against environmental antigens in CSU patients. This was
in contrast to the healthy controls, where the occurrence of staphylococcus specific IgE, if
present, was highly correlated with specific environmental IgE levels (Supplemental Table
2). Thus, sensitisations against staphylococcal antigens seem to evolve by a different route
in CSU compared to healthy controls, e.g. via (recurrent) bacterial infections or (constant)
colonisation. In In CSU patients, rates of skin colonisation with Staphylococcus aureus are
reportedly very low, 3% in one study [42]. In contrast, nasal colonization rates were found to
be increased in two independent studies, 53% in CSU vs. 13% of healthy controls in one
study [43]; and 56% in CSU vs. 28% of healthy controls in the other [30]). Interestingly,
antibiotic treatment of CSU patients with nasal colonization with S. aureus reportedly

reduced urticaria symptoms, in one study [30].

SEB induced histamine release is significantly higher in CSU patients, but limited.

In CSU patients the SEB induced histamine release on sensitized basophils was significantly
higher compared to healthy controls, but the total histamine release was relatively low
compared to the histamine released evoked via anti-lgE induced histamine release (e.g.
mean 12.1% SEB 100yug/m! compared to the anti-IgE induced histamine release, mean
5.4% SEB 30yg/ml; Figure 2c). Interestingly, the SEB-induced histamine release was
significantly correlated with the disease duration in CSU patients. This can either indicate
that SEB-IgE (and possible recurrent SE contact) can prolong CSU disease duration, or that
long lasting CSU and a pro-lgE switched immune system preferably produces (also) IgE to

SE.

Accordingly, high SEB-level could also induce histamine release via unspecific basophil
activation. Overall, the contribution to the total histamine release in CSU patients is limited,
indicating that SEB-IgE induced mast cell activation might not be sufficient to solely evoke
the clinical symptoms of CSU. Probably several specific IgE stimulations in parallel have to
occur in CSU (sum effect), or the specific IgE primes the effector cells to histamine release
to other (unspecific) trigger factors (priming effect). The significant correlation of the SEB
induced histamine release with the total IgE levels could point towards the first assumption,
that several specific IgEs (and their respective antigens) are needed in CSU to provoke a
clinical significant skin reaction. Currently we have no clear explanation, why SEA and
TSST-1 did not result in basophil activation. This is in contrast to reports on atopic dermatitis
where basophil histamine release to SEA or TSST-1 was seen [29]. We speculate that levels
and rates of specific IgE are lower in CSU patients as compared to AD, and that this may

affect the sensitivity of ex vivo basophil activation assays.

Beside the seen direct effect on basophils and mast cells in CSU, staphylococcal
superantigens could also contribute to the eosinophilic and mixed Th1/Th2 cell-mediated
inflammatory response seen in histologic examinations of CSU patients [44] [45]. In mice
exposed to staphylococcal superantigens, mixed Th1/Th2 cellular infiltration was reported
[46], and intracutaneous injection of SEB in wild type mice, but not in T cell deficient mice,
elicited mast cell degranulation and inflammatory responses, indicating that both,
superantigens and T cells are required for mast cell degranulation [47]. Taken together,
these findings suggest that IgE directed against staphylococcal superantigens may trigger
and perpetuate inflammation in at least some CU patients by effects on T cells and other non

mast cell populations.

Limitations of the study are the limited number and patient material of CSU patients and
healthy control subjects, the retrospective analysis of the patients’ data and the missing
information of aspirin intolerance and the patients’ colonisation status. Nevertheless, we
were able to detect specific IgE against SE’s and give first hints of functional relevance of
IgE-antibodies directed against staphylococcal enterotoxins, and especially the antigen SEB,
in CSU. IgE against staphylococcal enterotoxin B is functional in CSU patient sera and

linked to a prolonged course of CSU as well as daily disease activity.

The overall frequent detection of SE-IgE also in healthy controls, the relatively low serum
levels and mild histamine release of basophils do need further prospective investigations to
clarify the relevance of this finding. Our results should encourage the further assessment of

these types of IgE antibodies and their role and relevance in the pathophysiology of CSU.
