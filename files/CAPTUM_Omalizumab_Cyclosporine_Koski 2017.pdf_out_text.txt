Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is classified as urticaria
with or without angioedema that occurs for 6 or more weeks with
an unknown cause. The prevalence of CSU (also known as chronic
idiopathic urticaria) is approximately 0.5% to 5% of the population.
CSU may be active or reactivated for 1 to 5 years at a time, but in
some cases, CSU can relapse, lasting several years.' CSU has deleterious effects on patients’ quality of life, overall health, and
emotional well-being.” Although guidelines outline several options
for treating CSU, many patients ultimately resort to last-line therapies.' In this article, the 2 mainstay last-line treatment options for
CSU, omalizumab and cyclosporine, are compared.

According to US guidelines, first-line treatment for CSU is the
use of second-generation histamine; (Hj) antihistamines (ie,
cetirizine). Although effective for some urticaria, secondgeneration Hj-antihistamines, even at doses up to 4 times the
maximum approved dose, are often ineffective for CSU. The second
step in therapy is the addition of another second-generation H,antihistamine, addition of an H2-receptor antagonist, addition of a
leukotriene receptor antagonist, or addition of a first-generation
antihistamine (ie, diphenhydramine) taken at bedtime. If treatment with this approach also fails, a potent antihistamine (ie, hydroxyzine) can be dose advanced until no longer tolerated. This
treatment is often ineffective and may have adverse effects, such as
drowsiness, that affect patients’ quality of life. The next step is
last-line alternative treatments, including immunosuppressants,
such as cyclosporine; biologics, such as omalizumab; or antiinflammatories. Although omalizumab is approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration for CSU, cyclosporine and the other
last-line agents are not.! European guidelines, similar to US
guidelines, recommend a second-generation H-antihistamine first
line, increasing its dosage up to 4-fold second line, and adding

omalizumab, cyclosporine, montelukast, or a short course of corticosteroids for exacerbations third line.’ Data that support the lastline agents are limited, and some of these agents when taken long
term have significant adverse effects. Because the mechanism of
CSU is debatable, the-last line agents’ mechanisms are theorized
based on the hypothetical pathophysiologic mechanisms of the
disease.

Histamine release from mast cells causes urticaria and in some
cases angioedema. In CSU, there are several ways that histamine
release from mast cells may be occurring via IgE and non—IgEmediated pathways. A detailed description of the pathophysiologic
mechanism of CSU is beyond the scope of this article and is
comprehensively reviewed elsewhere.”

Select Treatments for Resistant CSU

Omalizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IgE, is the first
biologic agent approved for CSU. It is administered subcutaneously
at doses of 150 or 300 mg every 4 weeks (Table 1). The duration of
treatment needed for CSU has not been determined, so patients
should be monitored for resolution of urticaria. Monitoring IgE
levels during treatment is not recommended because dosing and
treatment duration of omalizumab for CSU are not based on IgE
levels. IgE levels may increase during omalizumab treatment
because of the presence of omalizumab-IgE complexes. Most
commercial assays detect total and not free IgE. Patients should be
monitored for adverse drug reactions, including anaphylaxis and
injection site reactions, on administration.*>

Cyclosporine, an immunosuppressant agent that inhibits T
lymphocytes, is used off label for refractory CSU and has been
studied at doses of 1 to 5 mg/kg daily. Cyclosporine is available in
modified and unmodified versions. Unmodified cyclosporine has
less absorption than the modified version and thus lowers
bioavailability, making the 2 products not interchangeable. Before
starting cyclosporine treatment, patients should have their blood
pressure checked on 2 separate occasions, and baseline laboratory
components, including blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine,
complete blood cell count, magnesium, lipids, potassium, and uric

acid, should be measured. Throughout treatment, initial laboratory
samples should be redrawn monthly and during dosage adjustments. Patients should be monitored for adverse effects, including
gum hyperplasia, hypertension, renal dysfunction, tremor, and
hirsutism. Because cyclosporine is an immunomodulator, patients
are at increased risk of infections and should be monitored for signs
and symptoms of infection.>°

Other treatment options suggested in the guidelines for refractory
CSU have much less supporting evidence than omalizumab or cyclosporine. These options include hydroxychloroquine, dapsone, methotrexate, sulfasalazine, or intravenous immunoglobulin.

Omalizumab Studies

Six major studies and 1 meta-analysis clinically analyzed omalizumab in patients with resistant CSU (Table 2).-"4 All studies
were multicenter, randomized, double-blind, and _placebocontrolled. MYSTIQUE (Phase III Open Label First Line Therapy
Study of MEDI 4736 [Durvalumab] With or Without Tremelimumab
Versus SOC in Non Small-Cell Lung Cancer) was the only study not
to include an antihistamine treatment in addition to omalizumab or
placebo as part of its treatment protocol.® The studies enrolled 91 to
336 patients and had similar inclusion criteria involving age,
duration and severity of CSU, and previous treatment. The duration
of treatment ranged from 4 to 28 weeks. Different severity or
quality-of-life measures were used as primary efficacy end points,
including Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7), Itch Severity Scale (ISS),
and the Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Score (CU-Q2oL). Although
each of these scales is slightly different, they all take into account
itchiness and amount of hives.® *

Omalizumab 75 mg, was effective vs placebo in 1 of its 3 studies.
The 150-, 300-, and 600-mg doses were effective vs placebo in all

studies in which they were used. According to the meta-analysis,
300 mg was the most effective dose. Adverse events were similar
between omalizumab and placebo. Some adverse events that
occurred with omalizumab were gastrointestinal upset and infusion site reactions.” 4

Cyclosporine Studies

Four studies assessed cyclosporine treatment in patients with
resistant CSU (Table 3). All 4 studies used modified cyclosporine.
Two studies were placebo-controlled,!*'° 1 was open label,'’ and 1
was retrospective.'® The doses of cyclosporine administered ranged
from 1 to 5 mg/kg daily. The study enrollments ranged from 25 to
110 patients. The study durations ranged from 1 to 6 months.
Different severity measurements were used as primary efficacy end
points.'? '® One study’ also compared biomarkers thought to be
involved in the pathophysiology of CSU.

All doses of cyclosporine studied were effective. Most adverse
events that occurred were minor, such as gastrointestinal
effects.'°-'® There were cases of mild increases in serum creatinine that required dose reductions.'® In the study by Serhat
et al,” significantly fewer biomarkers (interleukin 2 receptor,
tumor necrosis factor a, and interleukin 5) were present in patients without CSU than with CSU. There was also a significant
decrease in biomarkers in patients with CSU after taking
cyclosporine.'®

Conclusion

Both omalizumab and cyclosporine are effective treatment options for patients with resistant CSU. Omalizumab was most
effective with 300 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks. Cyclosporine
was effective at doses ranging from 1 to 5 mg/kg daily. Overall, the

omalizumab studies were better designed in terms of methods, but
collectively all studies reviewed provide useful data to support both
drugs as last-line options for the treatment of CSU. In terms of
burden on the health care system and patient adherence, omalizumab requires once monthly appointments for subcutaneous
administration by a health care professional during which the patient can be monitored for adverse injection site reactions. It does
not require laboratory monitoring. Cyclosporine requires monthly

laboratory monitoring and routine follow-up with a health care
professional. Its once- or twice-daily oral administration requires
strict patient adherence. Finally, omalizumab is approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration for use in CSU, whereas cyclosporine
is not. Both drugs are feasible options in resistant CSU, given their
effectiveness and safety profile. A future study comparing these
last-line agents may be helpful to clarify the treatment order for
resistant CSU.
