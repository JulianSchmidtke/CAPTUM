Abstract

Background: Approximately 50% of patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU)
experience symptoms that are not fully controlled by antihistamines, indicating an unmet clinical
need.

Objective: To evaluate the effects of the selective CRTh2 antagonist AZD1981 on symptoms and
targeted leukocytes in adults with persistent CSU despite treatment with Hj- antihistamines.

Methods: We performed a single center, randomized, placebo-controlled study involving adult
CSU subjects with symptoms despite daily antihistamines. Subjects underwent a 2-week placebo
run-in, 4 weeks of double-blinded therapy with either AZD1981 40 mg TID or placebo, followed
by a 2-week placebo washout. The primary objective was the effect of AZD1981 on CSU signs
and symptoms. Secondary objectives included the effects of AZD1981 on PGD>-induced
eosinophil shape change, circulating leukocyte subsets, CRTh2 expression on blood leukocytes,
and total blood leukocyte histamine content.

Results: Twenty-eight subjects were randomized to AZD1981 or placebo, with 26 completing
the study. Urticaria activity scores declined during the treatment phase for both groups, and were
significantly reduced in the AZD1981 group at the end of washout. AZD1981 treatment increased
circulating eosinophils and significantly impaired PGD -mediated eosinophil shape change.

CRTh2 surface expression rose significantly on blood basophils during active treatment. No
serious adverse events were observed.

Conclusions: This is the first study to examine the efficacy of a CRTh2 antagonist in
antihistamine-refractory CSU. AZD1981 treatment was well-tolerated, effectively inhibited PGDmediated eosinophil shape change, shifted numbers of circulating eosinophils, and reduced weekly
itch scores more than hives during treatment and into washout. Further studies are needed to
determine whether inhibition of the PGD2/CRTh2 pathway will be an effective treatment for CSU.

2. Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is defined as pruritus and hives occurring daily or
almost daily for at least 6 weeks without an underlying etiology [1]. Although second
generation H1- antihistamines are first-line therapy for CSU, 30-50% of patients fail to
achieve symptom control with antihistamines alone [2-4]. Cyclosporine, sulfasalazine,
dapsone, plaquenil, and mycophenolate mofetil have been used in more severe cases of
CSU, but each has the potential for significant toxicities that require frequent laboratory
monitoring [4, 5]. Omalizumab is approved for antihistamine-refractory CSU by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at 150 mg or 300 mg every 4 weeks, and the
European Medicines Agency (EMA) at 300 mg every 4 weeks. The optimal dose of
omalizumab is 300 mg every 4 weeks [6, 7], yet 47-66% of patients treated fail to achieve
complete symptom control (UAS7=0) at this dose[4, 6-8]. The disadvantages of
omalizumab treatment include the high cost of a biologic agent, the requirement for
subcutaneous injection in a physician’s office, and the need for an epinephrine auto-injector
prescription due to the risk of drug-related anaphylaxis of up to 0.2% [9, 10]. Thus, there
remains a need for safe, affordable, and convenient therapies for antihistamine-refractory
CSU.

While the pathogenesis of CSU remains unknown, biopsies of CSU skin lesions reveal
evidence of mast cell degranulation and infiltration by CRTh2-bearing leukocytes which
include basophils, eosinophils, and Th2 lymphocytes [11]. The endogenous agonist for
CRTh2 is prostaglandin Dz (PGD2) [12, 13], which is synthesized and released by activated
mast cells [14-18]. We recently reported that CRTh2 levels were notably decreased on blood
basophils and eosinophils from CSU subjects as compared to healthy controls [19]. This
finding is consistent with ongoing in vivo receptor-ligand engagement, leading to CRTh2
receptor internalization [20, 21].

The cellular effects of CRTh2 activation include shape change, chemotaxis, upregulation of
CD11b, Th2 cytokine production by Th2 cells and group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s),
eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) release by eosinophils, and enhancement of allergeninduced basophil histamine release [21-28]. Animal studies have shown that PGD2
propagates eosinophil mobilization from bone marrow [29] and mediates eosinophil
infiltration into the airway and skin [30-33]. PGDp injection into healthy human skin has

been shown to trigger wheal and flare responses [34, 35]. While the functional role of the
CRTh2 activation in CSU is unknown, 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CRTh2
promoter region are associated with antihistamineresistance in CSU [36].

AZD1981 is an oral, potent, selective, reversible antagonist of CRTh2 [37]. Preclinical
studies have shown that AZD1981 blocks CRTh2-mediated shape change in human
eosinophils and basophils in vitro, inhibits CRTh2-mediated chemotaxis of human Th2 cells
and eosinophils, and blocks PGD -mediated eosinophil release from bone marrow in guinea
pigs [37]. In clinical trials, oral CRTh2 antagonists have reduced esophageal eosinophils in
eosinophilic esophagitis [38] and provided an improvement in airway function and
protection against allergen-induced symptoms in patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis
and asthma [39-43]. Here we report the results of the first study to examine the safety and
efficacy of the selective oral CRTh2 antagonist AZD1981 as add-on therapy to standard
antihistamines in CSU.

3. Materials and Methods
3.1 Study Design and Participants

This is a phase II, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel
group study which recruited patients with CSU, ages 18 to 65, who remained symptomatic
despite treatment with standard doses of non-sedating Hrantihistamines (for details of
inclusion and exclusion criteria, see the Online Supplemental Materials section). This study
involved a 1- week screening period (days —7 to 0), a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in
(days | to 14), a 4- week randomized double-blind treatment period (days 15 to 42), and a 2week single-blind placebo washout (days 43 to 56) (Fig. 1).

During the screening and placebo run-in periods, subjects were required to have an in-clinic
physician-assessed urticaria activity score (UAS) of 2 or greater (range 0-6) and
demonstrate a UAS over 7 days (UAS7) of => 8. The UAS is a validated measure of CSU
disease activity which scores the intensity of pruritus (0-3) and number of hives (0-3) with a
maximum value of 6 [44]. The UAS7 is the sum of the daily average UAS scores (average of
a.m. and p.m.) for 7 days with a maximum value of 42 [45]. Participants were required to
show compliance with twice-daily symptom recording in eDiaries throughout the study.

Subjects who met screening and run-in criteria for symptom activity were randomized on
day 15 in a 1:1 ratio to receive either AZD1981 40 mg TID or matched placebo administered
orally as 10 mg tablets. This dose was selected based on preclinical PK and PD studies
comparing BID to TID dosing as well as safety considerations. Throughout the study,
participants were required to maintain stable doses of their pre-randomization,
Hrantihistamine treatment. Participants could take diphenhydramine 25 mg up to TID as a
rescue medication. Subjects who required therapies other than diphenhydramine (e.g.,
prednisone) to treat disease symptoms were removed from the study.

All research team members were blinded to treatment assignments with the exception of the
site pharmacists who dispensed the study drug, but did not interact with participants. The
pharmacists randomized subjects in blocks of 4 to maintain a balanced randomization.

3.2 Study Endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in diary-based clinical symptoms as measured
by the UAS7 from baseline (placebo run-in, days 8 to 14) to the last week in the treatment
period (days 36 to 42).

Secondary endpoints included the following: the safety of AZD1981; the pharmacodynamics
(PD) of AZD1981 through an ex-vivo eosinophil shape change assay; the pharmacokinetics
of AZD1981 through a serum bioassay; and quality of life benefit as measured by
Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaires. Additional efficacy endpoints
included the change from baseline to the last week of treatment of the following: weekly itch
severity scores (ISS), weekly score for number of hives, weekly score for the sleep
interference, rescue medication use, and presence of angioedema. Safety analyses included
adverse events (AEs), severe AEs (SAEs), laboratory abnormalities, and physical
examination abnormalities.

Exploratory endpoints were as follows: the change in circulating leukocyte population
numbers that are targeted by CRTh2 such as blood basophils, eosinophil and lymphocyte
numbers by automated analysis; the change in basophil histamine release and whole blood
histamine content; and pruritus-free and hive-free days during the treatment period. For
details of laboratory experiments, please see the Methods section in this article’s Online
Supplemental Materials.

3.3. Data Analysis

The analysis of the primary endpoint (change in UAS7 from baseline to week 4) was made
using pairwise comparisons. The UAS7 obtained 1 week prior to randomization was used as
the baseline score. The minimally important difference (MID) of the UAS7 for patients with
CSU is estimated to be 9.5 to 10.5 [45]. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test
(Prism 7.00) was used for intragroup comparisons between UAS7 values at baseline, the end
of treatment, and the end of placebo washout. The secondary endpoints were analyzed using
pairwise comparisons among the 2 study groups. Treatment comparisons of change from
baseline to week 6 in the weekly ISS and number of hives score was made using the
Wilcoxon signed-rank test. For missing patient-entered data (ISS and number of hives), the
preceding recorded observation carried forward. Patient characteristics were analyzed using
Chi-Square test and 2-sample t test for categorical and continuous variables, respectively.
Any AEs or SAEs were tabulated by system organ class and preferred term, as well as by
seriousness, severity, and treatment relatedness and reported by frequency. P values of < .05
were considered significant.

4. Results

4.1 Subject Characteristics

A total of 38 subjects were consented and 28 subjects were randomized to treatment with
AZD1981 or placebo. Following randomization, | subject withdrew due to CSU disease
progression and | subject withdrew due to inability to comply with study visits, leaving 26
subjects (93%) who completed the study (See the Online Supplemental Materials, Fig. S1).

Page 5

Baseline characteristics were similar across treatment groups (Table 1). All CSU subjects
were taking approved doses of H;-receptor antagonists. No subjects were taking leukotriene
receptor antagonists (LTRAs), aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
during the study.

4.2 Patient-reported Outcomes

During the course of the study, UAS7 scores decreased during the treatment phase for both
active and placebo groups, but reached a significant reduction only in the AZD1981 group at
the end of washout (Fig. 2). Active treatment had a greater effect on weekly itch severity
scores (35.9% reduction) than on hives (20.5% reduction, not shown), but only itch was
significantly reduced at the end of washout compared to baseline (P= .001 vs. P= .33).

This delayed effect raised the possibility of a carry-over effect as has been seen in prior
studies with CRTh2 antagonists [46]. UAS7 scores also decreased in the placebo group from
baseline to the end of treatment, but did not reach statistical significance. There was no
difference in symptom response to AZD1981 based on aspirin/NSAID sensitivity or
tolerance, baseline laboratory assessments (CRTh2 expression, blood eosinophil percent,
eosinophil shape change response), baseline UAS scores, or medication compliance. There
was no significant change in diphenhydramine use, DLQI, angioedema episodes, sleep
disturbance, emergency room visits, or hive-free days with AZD1981 treatment relative to
placebo.

Compliance with eDiary entry was high (90%) throughout the study and was similar
among groups. Of the 14 subjects who completed the study in the AZD1981 arm, | patient
was excluded from the final data analysis due to a dispensing error which resulted in the
patient receiving AZD1981 during the washout period. No other dispensing errors occurred.
One active patient and placebo patient were excluded from symptom analysis due to
malfunction or loss of eDiary device. Pill counts after each 2 week dispensation were
performed by the research pharmacists and revealed an overall compliance level of 86.54%
and 84.79% for active and placebo groups, respectively, during the 4 week randomized
treatment period.

4.3. Effects on Eosinophil Shape Change

Eosinophil shape change after PGD» stimulation is shown as mean increase in forward
scatter above vehicle for subjects at randomization, the end of treatment, and the end of
washout (Fig. 3). At baseline, the ia vitro addition of AZD1981 significantly impaired
PGD)-mediated eosinophil shape change at 0.1 tM dose (not shown) and 1 uM dose as
calculated by AUC (Table S1). ia vitro incubation with 1 uM AZD1981 significantly
decreased the area under the curve (AUC) of PGD2-mediated eosinophil shape at baseline
(prior to randomization) in both the active and placebo arms (P= .0005 and P= .002,
respectively).

At the end of the treatment period, ex vivo PGD-induced eosinophil shape change was
significantly inhibited in the AZD1981-treated group but not in the placebo group (Fig. 3).
Treatment with oral AZD1981 showed similar impairment in PGD-mediated eosinophil
shape change to in vitro inhibition with 1 4M AZD1981 performed at baseline. Furthermore,

peak serum drug levels achieved at end of AZD1981 therapy fell within or above this range
(Table $2). This inhibitory effect of AZD1981 therapy trended toward baseline at the end of
washout. In the placebo group, there were no significant changes observed at the end of
treatment and washout relative to baseline (Table S1B).

4.5. Effects on CRTh2* Leukocyte Percentages in Blood

The functional inhibition of eosinophil shape change observed at the end of AZD1981
treatment (Fig. 3A) occurred in parallel with a rise in circulating eosinophils at the end of
treatment (Fig. 4A) that did not reach statistical significance (from 2.49 + 0.37% to 3.5

+ 0.70%, P= .08). This rise in circulating eosinophils appeared to reverse at the end of
washout (2.9 + 0.46%, P= .40), supporting a transient impairment in eosinophil trafficking
to the skin. Shifts in the percentage of blood basophils did not follow a similar pattern as
eosinophils in the AZD1981 group, but assessments were limited by the presence of notable
basopenia in subjects (Fig. 4B). No changes in these parameters were seen in the placebo

group.

4.4 Effects on Basophil Surface Markers and Function

 

At the end of AZD1981 therapy, levels of CRTh2 surface expression rose significantly on
blood basophils (P= .03) (Fig. 5A) and trended towards baseline at the end of washout (P=.
13). Similar changes in basophil CRTh2 expression were not seen in the placebo group (Fig.
5B) or on blood eosinophils (Fig. 5C and 5D). We did not observe changes in the expression
levels of other basophil chemoattractant surface receptors, including CCR1, CCR3, or CCR5
(not shown). There was also no significant change in CD11b expression on basophils or
eosinophils, or CD203c expression on basophils, which are known to be enhanced after in
vitro exposure to PGD.[24] We did not observe significant changes in total blood leukocyte
histamine content, which is a reflection of blood basophil presence, or changes in basophil
histamine release (Fig. S2). Both of these measures for blood basophils were limited by the
small numbers of subjects in this study.

4.6 Safety and Tolerability

During the treatment period and follow-up period, no significant safety AEs, CBC, or liver
function test abnormalities occurred. A total of 9 patients (64.2 %) in the AZD1981 group
experienced at least one AE compared with 8 patients (66.6 %) in the placebo group (Table
2). The majority of adverse events were mild and led to no patients withdrawing from the
study. The most frequently reported adverse events among subjects were infection (5 active
and 5 placebo).

5. Discussion/Conclusion

This is the first study to examine the safety and efficacy of a CRTh2 antagonist in CSU. For
this study, we allowed the use of antihistamines as a major goal of this our study was to
evaluate the use of AZD1981 as an add-on therapy in antihistamine-refractory CSU patients.
As such, we required all subjects to take a standard dose of H1 antihistamines throughout
the study. Regardless, all patients continued to have moderate disease despite antihistamine
use and we excluded subjects whose symptoms were controlled on antihistamines.

With AZD1981 treatment, UAS7 scores decreased during the treatment phase, but reached a
significant decline from baseline at the end of drug washout. During this same time period,
AZD1981-treated subjects experienced a 35.9% decline in itch component scores. This
suggests the possibility of a carry-over effect as has been seen in other diseases targeted by a
CRTh2 antagonist [46]. In the placebo group, decreases were observed in UAS7 and itch
scores from baseline to the end of treatment which did not reach statistical significance.
These findings were confirmed using one-way ANOVA, with significant differences
(P<0.01) being seen only in the active group for UAS7 and itch. Active treatment had a
greater effect on weekly itch severity scores than on hive scoring (Fig. 2). However, this
study failed to meet the primary endpoint (UAS7 decrease > 9.5). There was no significant
change in DLQL, sleep interference, or in-clinic UAS scoring as a result of this brief 4-week
treatment period. Rescue medications were rarely taken by our subjects and there was no
significant impact of AZD1981 treatment on rescue medication use.

Consistent with the in vitro effects of AZD1981 on eosinophil migration, we found marked
inhibition of ex vivo eosinophil PGD -induced shape change in CSU subjects on active
therapy (Fig. 3) along with a transient rise in circulating eosinophils (Fig. 4). Both changes
trended towards baseline during drug washout suggesting a drug-induced effect on
eosinophils. This suggests that PGD2 may be a central pathway for eosinophil migration to
the skin. Surprisingly, these changes did not correspond with a significant change in CRTh2
surface expression on blood eosinophils. Although in vitro PGD2 binding to CRTh2 leads to
receptor internalization [20, 21], our results suggest that the decrease in eosinophil CRTh2
observed in CSU subjects compared to healthy controls [19] may not solely reflect CRTh2
receptor activation by PGD». For instance, in vitro IL-5 stimulation significantly reduces
human eosinophil CRTh2 expression [20] and it was shown that IL-5 m-RNA and protein
expression are increased in chronic urticaria lesions [11, 47].

Although eosinophils are a consistent infiltrating cell in urticarial skin biopsies [11, 48],
their role in CSU disease is unknown. The changes seen in eosinophil shape change and
circulating eosinophils with CRTh2 antagonism suggest a role for mast cell-derived PGD2 in
the migration of eosinophils into skin lesions in CSU and contribution to itch. While
eosinopenia is not a feature of CSU, there is data to suggest overall lower eosinophil counts
in CSU as compared to healthy controls [49]. In contrast to this study, CRTh2 antagonism in
subjects with persistent eosinophilic asthma led to reductions in sputum and tissue
eosinophils and in asthma symptoms, but did not shift peripheral eosinophils counts [43].
Thus, the effects of PGD2 may be disease and tissue compartment specific.

In support of impairment of PGD2 actions on basophils, levels of CRTh2 surface expression
rose significantly on blood basophils at the end of AZD1981 therapy (Fig. SA). Unlike
eosinophils, this finding in basophils supports the hypothesis that the reduced levels of
basophil CRTh2 expression previously noted in active CSU subjects is due to ongoing

PGD -mediated receptor downregulation [19]. We were limited in the performance of
additional functional assays of basophil CRTh2 inhibition such as basophil shape change
due to the basopenia associated with CSU. However, the effects of AZD1981 on basophil
receptor expression were specific to CRTh2, as we did not observe changes in the expression

levels of other basophil chemoattractant surface receptors that may also have roles in
basophil skin recruitment.

Interval improvement in clinical symptoms in CSU patients are reported to occur with rising
blood basophil numbers [50]. After 4 weeks of AZD1981 treatment, we did not find
significant changes in the percentage of basophils or a rise in total blood leukocyte histamine
content. Given the wide variance of this latter measure in CSU disease, we were underpowered to detect basophil number increase based on past experience [51]. In addition, the
lack of change in other basophil chemoattractant receptors may also explain the lack of
change in measures of circulating basophils.

The reason for the decrease in itch from AZD1981 therapy is currently unknown.
Intradermal PGD) injections trigger wheal and flare responses but do not produce immediate
itching [35]. We did not alter basophil histamine release mediated through the IgE receptor
or spontaneous histamine release, consistent with past studies that showed that PGD
enhances antigen mediated basophil histamine release but not that from polyclonal IgE
receptor crosslinking [52]. Therefore, the improvements in CSU subjects’ itch in our
AZD1981 trial may be through indirect actions on mast cells and/or basophils.

The late onset of itch reduction in AZD1981 recipients could be the result of reduction in
eosinophil recruitment to the skin and/or eosinophil-derived granule proteins (EDGPs) that
contribute to itch pathways. Previous studies have shown that PGD} activation of
eosinophils triggers ECP release [22]. Thus, it is possible that PGD> may trigger the release
of other EDGPs. Prior studies have revealed evidence of eosinophil activation CSU,
specifically the presence of extracellular MBP and ECP in CSU skin lesions and elevated
levels of ECP and major basic protein (MBP) in the serum of CSU patients despite normal
peripheral eosinophil counts [53, 54]. MBP produces an immediate erythematous wheal
when injected intradermally in humans and guinea pigs [55, 56]. Eosinophil MBP and
eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) were recently shown to trigger histamine release from skinderived mast cells via MrgX2 receptors which are increased in CSU skin mast cells
compared to healthy controls [57]. Thus, there is a need for additional studies to fully
understand the consequences of CRTh2 activation on eosinophil EDGP release.

Among the limitations of this study are the small number of subjects, short duration of
therapy and washout periods, and the lack of skin tissue biopsies to correlate with peripheral
blood leukocyte findings. In addition, the optimal dose of AZD1981 in CSU is unknown and
we were limited to the use of a single dose (40 mg TID) in this study. AZD1981 was
previously studied in allergic asthma at doses ranging from 10 mg BID to 400 mg BID, but
failed to produce a clinically relevant improvement in lung function in patients with allergic
asthma on ICS and LABA therapy [58]. This dose was selected based on preclinical PK and
PD studies comparing BID to TID dosing and safety considerations. While it is possible that
the use of a higher dose may have achieved the primary endpoint, a higher frequency of liver
function abnormalities were previously noted in higher doses (400 mg BID) [58]. Despite
this, we did observe a delayed yet modest reduction of disease activity particularly in itch,
impairment in eosinophil shape change and potentially migration, and a rise in basophil
CRTh2 expression, which would suggest that this pathway was inhibited by AZD1981.

In summary, this is the first study to examine the safety and efficacy of a CRTh2 antagonist
in antihistamine-refractory CSU. Our findings of AZD1981 support the hypothesis that the
CRTh2 pathway contributes to the formation of CSU skin lesions and symptoms,
particularly for eosinophils. AZD1981 was well-tolerated with no significant safety issues.
AZD1981 appeared to have a delayed positive effect on itch more so than wheals, although
the study failed to meet the primary endpoint in UAS7 reduction at the dose studied. Given
these findings, further studies are needed with longer treatment periods and higher dose
ranges to determine whether inhibition of the PGDz/CRTh2 pathway will be an effective
treatment for CSU.
