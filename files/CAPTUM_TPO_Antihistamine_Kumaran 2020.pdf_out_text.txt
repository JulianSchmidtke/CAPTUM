Abstract

Background: Urticaria is a common dermatosis affecting approximately 25% of the population. Childhood
chronic urticaria is frequently encountered, however, epidemiologic data on pediatric urticaria are limited.
Aim: The objective of this study was to study the clinico-epidemiological profile of children with chronic urticaria.
Methods: A retrospective study including children less than 14 years with chronic urticaria was conducted
from January 2010 to December 2015. Detailed history, clinical examination, investigation results, treatment
taken, and follow-up details were recorded on a prefixed proforma. As per the practice of the urticaria
clinic, the children were investigated only in case of inadequate therapeutic response or had features of
atopy/autoimmune disorders.

Results: Two hundred and ninety-six children (166 boys, 130 girls; mean age, 11.3 years) with chronic
urticaria were included in the study. Urticaria was spontaneous in onset in 57.1% (169) children; precipitating
factors were reported in 42.9% children, most common being physical factors, food allergy, drug intake and
infections. Investigations were done in 48 (16.2%) patients; Antinuclear antibody was negative in all patients,
raised serum IgE in 20/48 (41.6%), positive autologous serum skin test in 32/48 (66.6%) and raised anti-TPO
titre in 10/48 (20.8%) children. A diagnosis of chronic spontaneous urticaria was made in 245 (82.77%) children,
chronic dermographic urticaria in 35 (11.82%), cholinergic urticaria and drug-induced urticaria in 5 (1.69%)
each, aquagenic urticaria in 4 (1.35%) and cold-induced urticaria in 2 (0.68%) children. Two hundred and
fifteen (72.6%) children responded to nonsedating antihistamines alone, 61 (20.6%) required addition of
a sedating antihistamine, 7 (0.02%) required addition of montelukast, 3 (0.01%) ranitidine and 10 (20.8%)
required a short course of oral corticosteroids to control acute flare. None of the patients required any long-term
immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive agent. The mean duration of treatment required was 3 to 12 months.
Limitations: The main limitation is the study being retrospective in nature with associated drawbacks
of data loss. In addition, we did not use objective scoring system such as urticaria severity score and not
all children were extensively investigated.

Conclusions: Chronic spontaneous urticaria is the most common type of chronic urticaria in children.
Majority of these children can be managed conservatively with long-term antihistamines.

Key words: Antihistamines, chronic urticaria, pediatric

Introduction

Urticaria is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized
by the development of evanescent pruritic wheals and/or
angio-edemaa. It is classified into acute or chronic spontaneous
urticaria and inducible urticaria.! Despite being one of the
most frequently encountered dermatoses, epidemiologic data
regarding urticaria is meagre, especially among children.
The consensus statement on the management of urticaria
from the Indian Academy of Dermatologists, Venereologists,
and Leprologists and more recently the Position Statement
on the use of omalizumab in urticaria, highlights the lack
of epidemiologic data regarding urticaria in India.?? It also
highlights the knowledge gap that exists in the management
of pediatric urticaria. A systematic review concluded that
children with chronic urticaria not caused by physical stimuli
should undergo tests for allergy or infections only when there
is a history of cause-effect correlation.* The lack of studies
on epidemiology of urticaria in pediatric age group among
Indian population prompted us to perform this study.

Methods

Study design

This was a retrospective study. Case records of urticaria
patients attending the urticaria clinic at our institute
(Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research,
Chandigarh) were screened from January 2010 to December
2015. All children aged <14 years with a clinical diagnosis of
chronic urticaria of any subtype were included in the study.
While making the diagnosis of urticaria and classifying it,
the definitions proposed by EAACI/GA?LEN/EDF/WAO
guidelines were taken into consideration (starting from the
year 2009 and updated recently in 2014).!

A detailed history regarding the demographic characteristics
(age and sex), disease duration and evolution, diurnal variation,
seasonal variation, presence of coexistent angioedema, family
history, aggravating or initiating factors, associated cutaneous
or systemic illness and the management given was recorded
on a prefixed proforma. Detailed clinical examination was
performed in all patients. Tests for physical urticaria were
performed according to the standard recommendations.’
Drug-induced urticaria was confirmed with oral re-challenge
tests. Investigations were done wherever indicated: clinically,
due to inadequate response to treatment, and in the presence of
history suggestive of atopy/autoimmune disorders, and were
guided by their feasibility. These included complete blood
count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, stool examination for
parasites, serum IgE, antinuclear antibody, thyroid stimulating
hormone, anti- thyroperoxidase (TPO) antibody.

Treatment given

All patients were initially prescribed second-generation
H1-antihistamine (levocetirizine, loratadine or fexofenadine).
A stepwise approach of treatment was followed as per the
EAACI/GA°?LEN/EDF/WAO guidelines.° These medications
were used in the recommended doses for the age. The patients

Clinico-epidemiological features of chronic urticaria in children

were initially followed every 4 weeks for 1-3 months and
every 2 months thereafter. Antihelminthic medications
were used if stool examination showed parasitic infestation.
Response to antihistamines in children was taken as greater
than or equal to 75% improvement in symptoms, as assessed
by the dermatologist, otherwise termed as unresponsive
where the dose of antihistamines was hiked or second-line
management was initiated. Remission was considered if
symptoms did not recur for at least 3 months.

Data were expressed as individual values or mean + S.D.
For all quantitative variables, mean, median and standard
deviation were calculated. Qualitative or categorical variables
were described as frequencies and proportions.

Results

The case records of 296 children were studied. Table 1
summarizes the baseline characteristics and management
of study population. Urticaria was spontaneous in onset in
169 children. Personal/family history of atopy was present in
25% (74) children. Disease recurrence occurred commonly
during late evenings or early morning. One hundred and
twenty-seven children (42.9%) or their parents suspected an
inciting cause. However, among the children with suspected
food allergens, on a more detailed history, none reported a
consistent and reproducible relationship between food intake
and onset of urticarial rash. None of the children reported any
gastrointestinal symptoms with food intake. Investigations
were advised in 48 (16.2%) patients. Based on history and
investigations, 245 children were offered a diagnosis of
chronic spontaneous urticaria, 35 had chronic dermographic
urticaria, cholinergic urticaria in 5, drug-induced urticaria in
another 5, aquagenic urticaria in 4 and cold-induced urticaria
in another 2 children [Figure 1].

The duration of treatment required varied between
3 months and 12 months. Average duration of follow-up
was approximately 4 years. During follow-up, 280 (94.5%
children after regular treatment for 5—6 months had only

occasional wheals, following which antihistamines were
given only when required. Majority of the children,
i.e. 272 (91.8%) were on regular follow-up while the rest
were lost to follow-up after a variable period ranging from
1 to 6 months. All children were treated with non-sedating,
second-generation antihistamines initially followed by
the application of a stepwise approach depending on
their therapeutic response. No serious side-effects were
observed in our study cohort. Ten children required short
and tapering courses of oral corticosteroids (0.3 mg/kg/day
for 7 days) to control an acute flare of disease activity. The

cause of flare in these children was not known. Three of
these children had positive autologous serum skin test and
1 had raised anti-TPO titre. None of the patients required
any long-term immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive
agent.

Discussion

Population-based data on childhood urticaria are relatively
few. Around 0.1% to 3% of the children are diagnosed with
chronic urticaria.’ In a noninterventional birth cohort study,
5.4% of 404 participating, 6-year-old children were reported

52 Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology | Volume 86 | Issue 1 | January-February 2020
Kumaran, et al.

to have had at least a single episode of urticaria during the
last one year.®

Two hundred ninety-six children with chronic urticaria
were included in our study, and a slight male preponderance
(male:female — 1.28:1) was noted with a mean age of
11.34 years. Another study in 94 Thai children with
chronic urticaria found that 51% children had wheals with
angioedema,’ whereas study by Volonakis et al. on childhood
chronic urticaria found that 78.4% children had wheals alone,
6.6% had angioedema alone and 15% had both;'° our finding
corroborates with that of Volonakis et al.

Urticaria was spontaneous in onset in 57.1% (n = 169/296)
children in our study. Various precipitating factors were
reported/suspected in 42.9% children, the most common
being physical factors, followed by food allergy, drug
intake and infections. Later, this was confirmed in 51 out
of 296 (or in 17.3%) children. This is not too dissimilar to
the findings by Kozel et al. who reported that the etiology
of chronic urticaria in children is established in only 25%
cases despite investigations; the remaining cases are aptly
designated as chronic spontaneous urticaria, a group which
includes both autoimmune and idiopathic urticaria."
Similar results were observed by Volonakis et al. and
Sackesen ef al.'*'? Thus, chronic spontaneous urticaria
appears to be the most common type of chronic urticaria in
children. Various aetiological factors were associated with
approximately 20-25% cases of chronic urticaria; 17.23%
in our study cohort.

A positive autologous serum skin test was observed in
10.81% (32) children, indicating the role of autoreactivity
in childhood chronic urticaria. Different studies on chronic
urticaria in children, demonstrated a positive ASST in 38—
47% patients.°'*'4 Several autoimmune conditions have
been associated with childhood urticaria.'* Caminiti ef al.
conducted a study in antihistamine resistant cases of chronic
childhood urticaria and found 9.5% cases demonstrated
antithyroid autoantibodies.'* Kilic et al. reported a 14.8%
prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity in children with chronic
urticaria,'’ whereas Levy ef al. reported a prevalence of
4.3%,.'§ Because most patients with thyroid autoimmunity
remain clinically euthyroid, thyroid autoantibodies are likely
to represent an underlying autoreactive predisposition rather
than being themselves pathogenic. In our study, 3.38% (10)
children had a raised anti-TPO titre, 1 child had type 1
diabetes mellitus. Antinuclear antibody was negative in all
the children in whom it was done.

Management of childhood urticaria includes identification
and elimination of precipitating factors and antihistamines
for symptomatic relief.!° A recent systematic review
analyzing 9 reports (633 children) concluded that H1
antihistamines are effective and safe in children, although
many other options such as cyclosporine, omalizumab,

Clinico-epidemiological features of chronic urticaria in children

montelukast and cefuroxime have been tried.”” Majority
of the children in our study achieved adequate control of
their disease with second-generation antihistamines. In our
study, sedating, first-generation antihistamine was added for
20.6% (61) children to control their symptoms as itching was
interfering with their sleep. No side-effects were observed
in our study, which could be attributed to the retrospective
nature of the study and recall bias. In a study by Lee et al.
on the management of chronic spontaneous urticaria,
96.9% children achieved control with second-generation
antihistamines.?! Montelukast is licensed for pediatric use,
but there are very few studies assessing the effectiveness of
adding montelukast to antihistamine treatment of urticaria
in children. Corticosteroids can control urticaria effectively;
however, should be used only in selected severe cases and
exacerbations and only for short periods due to the potential
side-effects of chronic use.”? H2 blockers such as ranitidine
along with H1 antihistamines have also been used in chronic
refractory childhood urticaria. However, further studies are
needed to prove their efficacy.

An average follow-up for a period of 4 years was done in our
study. All children regularly followed up with us and most of
them (= 272; 91.8%) after a treatment period of 5—6 months
presented with only occasional wheals, following which the
antihistamines were stopped and given only when required.

There are several limitations of the present study. Being
retrospective in nature, there was missing data for many
variables. The mean antihistamine dosing was difficult to
calculate accurately because different brand names of drugs
were mentioned in case record sheets and missing data at
places. Lack of objective evaluating scores such as urticaria
activity score is a limitation in this retrospective study/chart
review. Similarly, investigations were not carried out in all
patients and were not exhaustive. Food challenge tests were
not carried out partly due of lack of feasibility in children and
partly due to inconsistent history.

Conclusions

Urticaria in children is most commonly spontaneous in onset,
and most of the children can be managed conservatively with
long-term antihistamines and without extensive and elaborate
investigations.
