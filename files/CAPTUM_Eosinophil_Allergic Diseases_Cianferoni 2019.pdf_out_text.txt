Abstract: Food allergies, defined as an immune response to food proteins, affect as many as 8% of
young children and 2% of adults in western countries, and their prevalence appears to be rising like
all allergic diseases. In addition to well-recognized urticaria and anaphylaxis triggered by IgE antibody—mediated immune responses, there is an increasing recognition of cell-mediated disorders,
such as eosinophilic esophagitis and food protein—induced enterocolitis. Non-IgE-Mediated gastrointestinal food allergies are a heterogeneous group of food allergies in which there is an immune
reaction against food but the primary pathogenesis is not a production of IgE and activation of mast
cells and basophils.

Those diseases tend to affect mainly the gastrointestinal tract and can present as acute (FPIES) or
chronic reaction, such as Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE), Food Protein-Induced Allergic Proctocolitis (FPIAP). The role of food allergy in Non-EoE gastrointestinal Eosinophilic disorders (NonEoE EGID) is poorly understood.

In some diseases like EoE, T cell seems to play a major role in initiating the immunological reaction against food, however, in FPIES and FPIAP, the mechanism of sensitization is not clear.

Diagnosis requires food challenges and/or endoscopies in most of the patients, as there are no validated biomarkers that can be used for monitoring or diagnosis of Non-IgE mediated food allergies.

The treatment of Non-IgE food allergy is dependent on diet (FPIES, and EoE) and/or use of drugs

(i.e. steroids, PPI) in EoE and Non-EoE EGID.

Non-IgE mediated food allergies are being being investigated.

1. INTRODUCTION

Reactions to foods have been reported for more than two
thousand years [1], however, in the last decade, there has
been a steady increase in the diagnosis of food allergies (FA)
due to an increase in atopic conditions as well as to increase
public awareness. Recent estimates suggest that one in the
four adults have FA in the western world, however, FA
which is diagnosed by testing, such as oral food challenge
(OFC) has a much lower prevalence, closer to 8% in young
children and less than 4% in adults. It is difficult to estimate
FA in the general population because FA is poorly understood and people have adverse reactions to various foods. In
the present paper, we will review the definition, prevalence,
clinical presentation and management of the emerging

gastrointestinal Non-IgE mediated FA that has different
pathogenesis and clinical manifestation compared to the
classical FA. The most common Non-IgE mediated FA is
present as delayed reactions to foods and can be chronic in
nature like Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE), Non-EoE Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Diseases (Non-EoE EGID), Food
Protein-Induced Proctocolitis (FPIAP) or acute such as Food
Protein-Induced Enterocolitis (FPIES) (Fig. 1).

2. DEFINITION

Adverse food reactions are defined as an abnormal response related to the ingestion of a food. They can be classified as food intolerance or food allergy based on the pathophysiological mechanism of the reaction [2]. Food intolerance are the adverse responses to a food, that are due to the
inherent properties of the food (i.e. toxic contaminant, pharmacologic active component such as caffeine, alcohol) or
abnormal response of the host (i.e. lack of enzymes such as
lactase in lactose intolerance or metabolic disorders, food
aversion due to psychological issues). Food intolerance reactions tend to be dose-dependent and are not consistently re

producible. The vast majority of food allergic reactions reported by the general population are food intolerances [2].

Food allergic reactions are pathological immunologic
responses to food that occurs in a susceptible host. These
reactions are reproducible each time the food is ingested *.
Based on the immunological mechanism involved, food allergies may be further classified in a) IgE-mediated, which
are mediated by antibodies belonging to the Immunoglobulin
E (IgE) and are the best known and well-characterized food
allergy reactions; b) Non-IgE, when the specific IgE to foods
are not important and the cell compartment of the immune
system is responsible for food allergy; c) mixed IgE cell mediated when both IgE and immune cells are involved in the
reaction [1, 3-5].

The most common food allergies in the United States and
the western world are the IgE mediated food allergies, which
have the highest prevalence in children below 3 years of age
(6-8%) [2]. Recent studies report a significant increase in
food allergy and food induced-anaphylaxis, with FA being
the leading cause of anaphylaxis which is treated in hospital
emergency departments in Western Europe and the United
States [6, 7]. The most common foods involved in IgE mediated food allergy are milk, egg, peanuts, tree nuts, seafood,
soy and wheat. Treatment for IgE mediated food allergies
includes avoidance of the allergens, availability of rescue
medications such as self-injectable epinephrine and oral immunotherapy. IgE-mediated classic food allergic reactions
are immediate, reproducible, and are caused by food-specific
IgE, which can readily be detected to confirm the Food allergy diagnosis [2]. IgE binds to IgE high-affinity receptors

(Fc€RI) on basophils and mast cells, and upon exposure of
the food, the specific food antigen gets recognized by 2 or
more specific IgE bound to the Fc€RI with consequent
crosslink of the receptor and activation of mast-cells to release histamine and other mediators that cause vasodilation
and related hives, angioedema, low blood pressure and or
smooth muscle constriction with consequent bronchospasm,
diarrhea and vomiting [8].

Non-IgE mediated food allergies (Non-IgE-FA) have
been increasing worldwide. The most common Non-IgE-FA
are Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE), Non-EoE eosinophilic
gastrointestinal disorders (Non-EoE-EGID), Food proteininduced enterocolitis (FPIES) and Food Protein induced Allergic Proctocolitis (FPIAP). EoE, Non-EoE-EGID, FPIAP
are chronic in nature whereas FPIES is an acute disease.

The Non-IgE-FA are immunologic reactions to food and
occur in the absence of demonstrable food-specific IgE antibody in the skin or serum, therefore, it can have several different pathogenetic mechanisms [9]. T cells may play a central role in EoE, however, the pathogenesis of FPIES and
FPIAP is still less clear [10, 11].

3. EOSINOPHILIC ESOPHAGITIS (EoE)

EoE is a clinical-pathologic disease characterized by
symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and eosinophilia affected the esophagus. EoE is as prevalent as Crohn’s disease
in the US with the most recent estimate at 56.7/100,000 [12,
13]. FA appears to play a role in over 90% of children and
Non-IgE Mediated Food Allergy

adults with EoE, as an elemental diet is able to induce clinicpathological remission in the majority of pa tients [14-17].

In younger patients, EoE symptoms consist of a failure to
thrive, feeding difficulties, gagging, vomiting, food refusal
and appear to be related to inflammatory induced gastroesophageal dysfunction, whereas adolescents and adults develop dysphagia and food impaction due to reversible and
irreversible fibrotic changes [10].

Diagnosis is based on esophagoduodenoscopy (EGD)
and the finding in at least of 1 biopsy positive of 15 eos/hpf
[18-20]. Macroscopically, EGD can be normal or show signs
of inflammation or fibrosis, such as Exudates, Rings,
Erithema, Furrows, Stricture, which can be graded in the
EREFS grading system [21]. Microscopically, besides eosinophilia, ancillary signs are the organization of eosinophils
in abscesses, lymphocytosis, hypertrophy of the basilar
membrane and fibrosis [22, 23]. The disease leads to the
development of patches to with normal areas of mucosa
mixed with inflamed ones therefore, at least 3 biopsies
should be performed in different parts of the esophagus, (i.e.
Distal, mid and proximal) even if the esophagus looks normal macroscopically. Indeed, false-negative biopsy rate is
reduced when more biopsies are performed [25, 26]. EGD is
the only available follow up tool to assess the efficacy of
treatment. Serial EGDs are often necessary for proper EoE
management because there are no available biomarkers or
pathognomonic elements that can replace EGD for clinicpathologic diagnosis and monitoring [27].

 

The individuals affected by EoE are mostly Caucasian,
males and have a high rate of atopic co-morbidities (i.e. allergic rhinitis, asthma, IgE mediated food allergy and/or eczema) [28]. Other family members are often affected as genetics play a larger role in EoE compared to other atopic
diseases [29]. For example, having a sibling affected by
asthma doubles the chance of developing the same disease
compared to the general population, but having a sibling
affected by EoE increases the chances by about 40 times
[30]. Identical twins have almost 800 times higher risk than
the general population. It is therefore not surprising that
many Single-nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) (-TGF-B [3133], CCL-26 (Eotaxin 3) [34]; Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)
[35]; thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) at 5q22, Calpain
14 (CAPN14) on chr2p23.1 and cllorf30/EMSY on
chr11q13.5 [36-39] and genetic defects, such as the risk of
connective tissue disorders such as Marfan’s syndrome, hypermobile Ehrlos Danlos’ Syndrome [40], autosomal dominant Hyper-IgE Syndrome, AD-HIES) [41] ; defects in
PTEN, tumor suppressor lipid phosphatase and tensin homolog and a defect in the epithelial protease inhibitor
SPINKS [42, 43]; dehydrogenase El and transketolase domain—containing 1 (DHTKD1) in DHTKD1 homolog oxoglutarate dehydrogenase-like (OGDHL) [44].

However, the reason why multiple family members are
affected by EoE might be because of common environmental
risk factors. Fraternal twins have 5-10 times higher risk of
developing EoE compared to siblings and only 40% of identical twins develop the disease suggesting that environmental
factors may play a role. This also explains the rapid rise of
disease in many western countries. Jensen et al. [45] found a
positive association between EoE and several early-life fac
Current Pediatric Reviews, 2020, Vol. 16, No.0 3

tors such as maternal fever, preterm labor, cesarean delivery,
antibiotic and acid suppressant use in infancy. The authors
observed an inverse association between having a furry pet
in infancy and EoE. The same data have been shown
independently by other groups [46, 47]. Environmentrisk
gene interaction has been examined in one study and there
was an association between breast-feeding and SNP
186736278 on CAPN14 and NICU admission and SNP
1s17815905 on LOC283710/KLF 13 [45].

Food allergens, mainly milk and wheat, but also egg,
legumes, meats and soy have played a central role in EoE
[10], probably by activating Th2 cells [48]. Recent advances
in research have shown that a dysfunctional epithelium may
play a central role in inducing a local and possibly systemic
Th2 response against food and environmental allergens in
genetically predisposed individuals [10, 49]. In patients who
have active EoE, esophageal biopsy specimens have been
consistently found to have greater number of T cells, invariant natural killer cells (INKTs), basophils and mast cells and
increased expression of the Th2 prototypical cytokines such
as IL-5, IL-4, and IL-13 [50, 51].

Eosinophils are infiltrating cells in EoE biopsies and are
able to secrete some Th2 cytokines, they appear to be the
result of an initial Th2 inflammation but they do not initiate
inflammation. Ant-IL-5 trails in both adults and children are
able to reduce eosinophils from esophageal biopsies of EoE,
but it does not reduce symptoms or other inflammatory
changes in the tissue [10].

Similarly, despite the high rate of atopic diseases and
IgE-mediated FA, some evidence suggests that IgE doesn’t
play a central role in EoE pathogenesis [52]. Indeed measurement of specific IgE to foods via a skin prick test or serum is not useful to establish the real food triggers in EoE
[53, 54]. Oral immunotherapy, which is used to induce desensitization in IgE-mediated food allergy, can cause EoE in
approximately 2-5% of desensitized patients, indicating a
non-IgE mechanism in EoE pathogenesis [55, 56]. Similarly,
patients that overcame IgE-FA can develop EoE once food
dysmotility reintroduced in the diet [57]. Other evidence
such as the ability of mice to develop EoE like disease in the
absence of IgE, the lack of efficacy in clinical trials with
anti-IgE suggests that IgE are not central in EOE pathogenesis [52, 58]. Another feature common to other atopic chronic
diseases such as asthma, AD, and EoE is the remodeling, the
by-product of chronic inflammation [10, 59]. Food impaction is due to inflammation-induced dysmotility or reversible
or irreversible fibrosis, and it is the most common symptom
of EoE in teenagers and adults [60, 61]. In patients who have
untreated EoE, the development of strictures is a concern as
a longer duration of EoE leads to the development of irreversible fibrotic strictures [60].

In order to prevent long-lasting fibrosis and for the treatment of symptoms, there are three main clinically-accepted
treatment strategies for EoE: Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs),
Dietary elimination and corticosteroid treatment. Esophageal
Dilation is an option in patients with irreversible fibrosis
[62].

PPIs are now considered the first drug to be used in the
management of EoE based on the most recent guidelines [63,

64]. Many practitioners consider PPIs as a first-line therapy
in EoE as they are easy to administer and have a very favorable risk-benefit ratio. Patients with EoE responsive to PPIs
should be treated indefinitely with PPI as mono-therapy [63].
A therapy with dietary exclusion or steroid should be performed only on those patients whose EoE doesn’t respond to
PPI [63]. In a meta-analysis of 32 studies on PPI treatment in
EoE, 50.5% (95% CI 42.2%-58.7%) patients had histologic
improvement (to <15 eosinophils/hpf) with significant differences among different studies [65]. The dosage effective
in EoE treatment is on the higher side with most physicians
using 1-2 mg/kg in children and 40 mg of omeprazole (or
equivalent dosages for other PPIs) once or twice a day. The
mechanism of action of PPIs in EoE is not clear. PPIs are
well-established inhibitors of gastric parietal H+/K+-ATPase
and this effect may reduce acidic injury to the esophagus and
cause epithelial healing. However, PPI show anti-cytokine
effects at the level of the esophageal epithelium [66], by directly inhibiting epithelial STAT6, a key transcription factor
for the secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokines (i.e. Eotaxin-3) and cytokines (i.e. Th2 cytokine) [67] (Table 1).

As in all atopic diseases, steroids, both oral and topical
are very effective in inducing EoE remission. Oral steroids
can treat the disease clinically and histologically, however,
they carry significant side effects if used long term and given
the chronicity and life long duration of EoE, they are not
recommended for long term treatment [68]. Systemic corticosteroids can, however, be used for emergency cases, such
as severe dysphagia, hospitalization, and weight loss [27].

 

Topical corticosteroids are effective in inducing EoE
remission, although steroid resistance (as demonstrated by
the lack of histological responsiveness and the failure to
modify local esophageal gene expression) has been reported
[69]. In Europe, oro-dispersible tablets of 1 mg Budesonide
(Jorveza”) are approved for the treatment of EoE in adults.
In the US, there are no topical steroids approved for EoE,
therefore, steroids used for asthma, such as fluticasone or
budesonide are the most common off label prescribed drugs.
Patients are instructed to spray fluticasone from a metered
dose without a spacer in the back of their mouth and swallow
(not inhale) at the dose of 110 mcgX 2 puffs twice daily for
children year< 8 years of age and 220 mcg X 2 puffs twice

daily for children year>8 years of age. No food or drink is
allowed 30 minutes after the medication is administered.

Oral viscous budesonide has also been shown to be effective. Children under the age of 10 received | mg daily and
those who were 10 or over received 2 mg/day. Viscous
budesonide is obtained by mixing 1 mg _ Pulmicort
RespuleTM (0.5mg or 1 mh budesonide/2 mL intended for
nebulized administration) with 10 g (10 packets) of sucralose
(SplendaTM) to create a volume of approximately 8mL [70,
71]. No food or drink is allowed 30 minutes after the medication is administered.

In a prospective randomized trial [26] in children and
adults, the efficacy of Fluticasone by metered-dose inhaler in
inducing histological and clinical remission ranges from 50
to 90% as reported by different authors [69, 72-74]. Esophageal Candida overgrowth is a major side effect and is
seen in approximately 15% of patients. Randomized control
study in children and adults for the use of Oral viscous
budesonide indicates 70-80% of responders [70, 71, 75]. A
recent randomized trial to compare Fluticasone and viscous
Budesonide for EoE treatments showed that viscous
budesonide provided a significantly higher level of esophageal exposure to the therapeutic agent, which correlated with
lower eosinophil counts [76]. Moreover, there is some evidence that budesonide can reverse esophageal fibrosis [77].
Additional studies have documented their short-term safety,
except for local fungal infections [27]. Oral dispersible tablets appear to have similar efficacy to viscous budesonide
and are more favorable to patients [78].

Based on such studies, topical corticosteroid therapy can
be considered in all children and adults affected by EoE for
both initial therapy and maintenance therapy. Currently,
there are many unanswered question in topical steroids
chronic use. In particular, there is no consensus regarding
dosage, formulation, frequency and how to obtain remission
using minimal steroid dosage. Long term side effects are an
important concern , no study has been conducted regarding
bone health in either adults or children for longer than 1
year. Moderate high dose of topical steroids like the one
used to treat EoE, is associated with significant reduction in
growth in children [79, 80]. Adrenal suppression, for example, has been reported in some children using topical steroids
Non-IgE Mediated Food Allergy

for EoE, especially if they were using inhaled steroids for
asthma and allergic rhinitis at the same time [81].

FA has been shown globally to be the most common
trigger of EoE, as numerous studies in both adults and children have demonstrated how dietary restriction therapies
have been successfully used for EoE treatment [52-54, 68,
82-86]. Elemental diets using amino-acid based formula as
the sole source of nutrition are able to induce clinical and
histological remission in the vast majority of patients with
EoE [54, 68, 87]. This strategy is associated with a significant reduction in quality of life, tube feeding and it is extremely difficult to adhere to for longterm [88]. As such,
single and multi-food elimination diets have been described
in multiple clinical trials and observational studies were effective in inducing disease remission in 60-80% of the patients [52-54, 68, 82-86]. Various dietary strategies have
been tried with comparable efficacies, with the more restrictive being able to induce a more rapid and frequent remission
[88]. Examples of common diet used in EoE management
are: 6-food (milk, wheat, egg, soy, peanut/treenut,
fish/shellfish), 4-food (milk, wheat, egg, soy) ; to 2-food
elimination (milk, wheat) or 1-food (milk) elimination diets
with a recent prospective study showing benefit in 2-food
elimination (milk, wheat) with step-wise additional restriction if clinically necessary compared to more restrictive approaches [52-54, 68, 82-86]. If more restrictive diets are chosen, once remission is achieved, it is important to do a sequential single food reintroduction followed by EGD in order to identify the trigger to find the least restrictive effective
diet as those are more likely to be followed successfully long
term [88]. Unfortunately at the moment, the diet is largely
empirical as traditional allergy testing measurements of specific IgE to food via skin prick test, serum evaluation and
atopy patch test have been shown to be less effective than
the empiric method to find EoE food trigger [63, 89]. This is
probably due to the fact that the role of IgE in food-induced
EoE is minimal, if any [52] and to the lack of standardization
of food atopy patch tests [89]. This empiric dietary approach
is very undesirable as patients have to wait a long time and
undergo multiple endoscopies before finding the allergen
trigger [88]. Therefore, the development of allergen testing
for food allergens with high specificity and sensitivity for
use in EoE is a priority for many researchers working in the
field.

Recently, a specific CD154 induction in vitro of peripheral blood T cells to milk in patients with milk induced EoE,
suggesting that this test could be used in the future to predict
specific FA in patients with EoE, however further prospective study will be needed to confirm the clinical applicability
of the test [48].

In the future, more targeted therapy for EoE is going to
be available as several novel treatments are under investigation. Antibodies that target only specific aspects of Th2 inflammation, such as anti-IgE and anti-IL5 have been tried
with limited success [90-94]. On the other hand, antibodies
which were able to block more broadly Th2 inflammation
like anti chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule on
Th2 cells (CRTH2) (a prostaglandin D (2) (PGD (2)) receptor) [95], the anti-IL-4 anti-IL-13 (dupilumab) or anti-IL-13
(RPC4046) have been shown to be more promising in small

clinical trials [95-97]. Antibodies targeting Th2 pathway are
very desirable as many patients with EoE have a number of
atopic disorders including asthma or atopic dermatitis which
are amenable to management with these biologic therapies
and therefore, it remains important to understand their effects on the disease process in EoE.

4. Non-EoE-EGID

Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis (EGE), Eosinophilic Gastritis (EG), Eosinophilic Colitis (EC) are a group of very rare,
ill-defined diseases characterized by eosinophilia limited to
the gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach, duodenum,
ileus, colon) [98-100]. Differently from EoE, Non-EoEEGID are rarely responsive to dietary restriction with consistent success only in a minority of cases reported for those
diseases limited to the stomach. Therefore, the role of food
allergy in such diseases is less clear.

EGE are characterized by the involvement of multiple
locations, whereas in EG and EC, eosinophils are found only
in the stomach/duodenum or colon. Eosinophilic ileitis exists
but they are poorly characterized as biopsies of the ileum are
rarely obtained [31, 101].

The diagnosis of Non-EoE-EGID has based primarily on
clinic pathological criteria, but the exact number of eosinophils considered pathologic has not been universally established, indeed differently from the esophagus in normal individuals eosinophils are commonly found in the lower gastrointestinal tract [98-100]. In a recent pediatric study, the
authors defined as pathological > 50 eos/hpf in stomach or
colon, 30/hpf for duodenum and ileum based on the fact that
normal levels are between 10 to 50 eos/hpf (with the distal
colon and stomach being the organ where the highest level of
eosinophils is found in normal individuals and lower levels
in duodenum, ileum and proximal colon) with a gradual distribution [102]. The eosinophilic infiltration can be limited to
the superficial layer of the GI mucosa (mucosal EGE, EG,
EC), they can involve only the serosal epithelium (serosal
EGE, EG, EC) or can be deep and involve the muscular layer
(mucolaris EGE, EG, EC).

The type of inflammation responsible for EGE, EG and
EC appears to be similar. It is not clear if EGE, EG and EC
are different diseases or a spectrum of the same common
pathological process however, they appear to be on a different spectrum then EoE [103]. A recent study, for example,
showed that EoE and EG are different diseases as EG is diferent from EoE and it is appeared to be a systemic disorder
associated with high levels of blood and gastrointestinal tract
eosinophilia, Th2 immunity, and a conserved gastric transcriptome signature, with only 7% of patients with EG having a transcriptome that overlapped with EoE [103].

 

 

 

In one of the largest published studies on 42 patients,
Dellon et al. [104] found that only a minority of patients with
EGE responded to treatment (35%; 15/42). Among those
who responded about 47% responded to diet, 80% to steroids, and 7% mast cell stabilizer or anti-leukotrienes. In another study [101], 40% of EGE patients had spontaneous
remission and the rest responded poorly to any treatment
[101]. The value of the diets, both elemental and elimination
ones is the object of some debate, and recent meta-analysis
6 Current Pediatric Reviews, 2020, Vol. 16, No. 0

on the use of diet in EGE shows no efficacy in the majority
of cases [105].

The oral steroids are the most effective treatment both in
the short term and in the long term [101, 104, 106]. The use
of the topical steroid budesonide used in capsule has had
some sporadic success [101, 104, 106-111]. Patients with
suspected predominantly ileal disease can use the budesonide granules in capsules for optimal ileal activity. These capsules controlled release budesonide in the ileum with very
minimal gastric delivery [112]. If stomach is affected opening the capsule and drink them intact and after crashing them
mixed with liquid can help the diseases. The starting dose for
swallowed budesonide is typically 9-27 mg once daily [112].
Case reports show that occasionally PPI and mast cell stabilizers are effective in EGE treatment [101, 104, 106, 113,
114]. However, it is hard to tell as patients can have spontaneous remission and the effects in case reports maybe due to
medication or spontaneous remission.

 

In both pediatric and adult patients with EG diet (both
elemental and SFED) have been reported to be more effective [102, 115]. However, diet often is effective after several
days and most patients are treated initially with systemic
steroids (0.5-1 mg/kg/day 5-14 days), which differently from
EGE are very effective in inducing remissions. Once symptoms are controlled, steroids are typically tapered over a few
weeks (2-4). Once remission is achieved, long term therapy
can be done with diet or with the use of topical or swallowed
steroids (Crashed granules from budesonide capsules as
above described) [111].

Recently, advances in biologics targeting cytokines and
cells responsible for eosinophilic inflammation are being
used in clinical trials to treat Non-EoE EGIDs. Antibodies
specific Anti-IL-5 (mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab), anti- IL-13 ( QAX576, RPC4046), anti-IL-4/IL-13
(Dupilumab) , anti-integrin responsible for transmigration of
lymphocytes (Vedolizumab), anti Eotaxin —‘1-2-3
(GW766994), or able to induce apoptosis of Eosinophils
such as anti-Siglec-8 (AK002) have been shown to reduce
eosinophilic infiltrations and are currently being tried in several non-EoE-EGID cohorts [116].

5. FOOD PROTEIN INDUCED ENTEROCOLITIS
(FPIES)

Initially described in the late ‘70s and early ’80s, food
protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) [117, 118],
FPIES has been increasingly recognized as an important
‘ood allergy in infants and young children and the first international consensus guidelines were published in 2017 to improve diagnosis and management of FPIES [119]. Recent
imited epidemiological studies show that FPIES is not as
rare as previously thought, with an estimated prevalence
between 0.34 to 0.7% in infancy [120, 121, 122]. Typically
FPIES manifest acutely 1 to 4 hours (usually 2 hours) after
‘ood ingestion and is characterized by profuse, repetitive
vomiting, lethargy and pallor [119]. A minority of patients
(20-50%) will develop diarrhea several hours later [120, 12328]. Recently, a form of chronic FPIES has been described
in young infants due to soy or milk intake. In those infants
symptoms manifests as chronic diarrhea, intermittent vomiting, failure to thrive, hypo-albuminemia and anemia. If the

offending food is removed, symptoms improve rapidly
within 72 hours, however, upon reintroduction classical
FPIES with life threatening reaction ensues [129-132].

The most common food reported as trigger of FPIEs are
milk, rice followed by soy, oat, egg, poultry [119, 127]. It
appears that the most common food allergens in FPIES differ
within different geographical regions with milk being the
most common foods in US and Israel and rice in Australia
[119, 127]. Similarly, soy is a common trigger in the US, but
rare in Australia and Israel where soy based formula are less
used [119, 127]. However, every food including those rarely
considered allergenic (i.e. sweet potatoes, squash, banana
and avocado) have been described as culprits [119, 127,
133]. Most patients are allergic to only 1-2 foods but multiple food allergies are not rare [119, 127, 133]. Typically,
patients outgrow the disease by age 3 [119]. However, long
lasting diseases into elementary school age have been described expecially among patients with multiple food triggers and those that develop IgE antibodies to FPIES food
triggers [119, 134]. The natural history for more rare food
triggers is largely unknown.

 

The pathogenesis of FPIES is still not completely understood. Monocytes and lymphocytes have been shown to have
a pan-activation during acute reactions [11]. However, the
cell ultimately responsible of antigen recognition and reaction initiation is unknown and therefore no biomarker or in
vitro testing are currently available for diagnosis of FPIES or
its food allergy trigger [119].

Acute FPIES reactions are treated with the use of IV fluids, ondasetron IV or IM may help to reduce severity based
on limited studies. Epinephrine is used only IV in an intensive care setting to support blood pressure in case of prolonged reduced blood pressure irresponsive to fluid resuscitation. IV steroids may also be helpful in prolonged reactions
associated with diarrhea [119, 135].

The disease is currently treated long with diet, avoiding
the known triggers, and its diagnosis is largely empirical
based on history and open food challenges in protected clinical setting [119]. Skin prick tests, measurement of specific
IgE in the blood and atopy patch tests are unreliable to predict food allergy triggers as IgE specific to food are absent in
the vast majority of patients at diagnosis and Atopy patch
test have poor sensitivity and specificity [119].

Food challenges are indicated only if history is not consistent with suspected clinical triggers, or to assess the
achieved tolerance [119, 135]. Food challenges to trigger
foods may be dangerous and result in protracted vomiting
and low blood pressure that may need vaso-pressure support,
therefore, should be done only in a protected clinical environment and when necessary [136].

6. FOOD PROTEIN-INDUCED ALLERGIC PROCTOCOLITIS (FPIAP)

A form of Food protein Induced Allergic Proctocolitis
(FPIAP) is a very common food allergy in infancy. Infants,
bottle fed or breast fed, may present with bloody stools in the
absence of any other symptoms. Removal of the products
causing allergy, typically milk and or soy, from the diet either using hypoallergenic formulas or by restricting the diet
Non-IgE Mediated Food Allergy

in breastfed babies, induces a rapid remission in a few days
[137]. Diets are largely empiric as skin prick test and atopy
patch tests are not sensitive or specific in predicting triggers
of FPIAP. Oral food challenges following a restricted diet
are necessary to establish diet [138, 139]. If left untreated,
the major risk of FPIAP is anemia, so severely restricted diet
in breastfeeding moms are not indicated. Indeed is extremely
rare that foods other than milk and soy are implicated; therefore, if there is not a prompt response to milk elimination at
least a month should be waited before further restricting maternal diet [140]. FPIAP is, therefore, very different from
chronic FPIES and the 2 forms should not be confused

CONCLUSION

Non-IgE-Mediated gastrointestinal food allergies are a
heterogeneous group of food allergies in which there is an
immune reaction against food but the primary pathogenesis
is not a production of IgE and activation of mast cells and
basophils.

Those diseases tend to affect mainly the gastrointestinal
tract and can present acutely (FPIES) or as chronic delayed
reactions, such as EoE, FPIAP. The role of food allergy in
Non-EoE EGID is poorly defined.

In EoE, T cell seems to play a major role in initiating the
immunological reaction against food, however, in FPIES and
FPIAP, the mechanism of sensitization is less clear.

Diagnosis requires food challenges and or endoscopies in
most of the patients. None of the Non-IgE mediated food
allergies have validated biomarkers.

Treatment of Non-IgE FA relies on diet (FPIES, and
EoE) or the use of steroids and PPI in EoE and Non-EoE
EGID

Non-IgE mediated food allergies are an object of intense
investigation.
