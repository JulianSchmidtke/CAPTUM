Introduction

Omalizumab (OmAb) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the C-epsilon-3 locus of
the Fe (constant fragment) portion of free immunoglobulin E (IgE) [1-3]. Anti-IgE OmAb recognizes an epitope
that is masked when IgE is bound to its high-affinity
receptor, Fe epsilon receptor I (FceRI). OmAb was synthesized with the aim of sequestering free IgE to reduce
its binding capacity, thereby reducing mediator release
and allergic inflammation [4]. OmAb rapidly reduced
IgE levels and, consequently, also lowered FceRI levels
in mast cells [5] and basophils [6], thus resulting in a

*These authors contributed equally to this work

Results We found that OmAb dissociates pre-bound IgE from mast cells and basophils,
resulting in a reduction of proximal phosphorylation-mediated signalling events (Syk,
PLCy, and LAT) and in a decrease in degranulation and leukotriene synthesis.

Conclusion Our data prove the existence of common mechanisms of action of OmAb in
mast cells and basophils that would explain its effectiveness and rapid effect in chronic
urticaria and provide a basis for its use in other diseases mediated by these cells.

reduction of the amount of positive allergen skin prick
tests in patients suffering from allergic rhinitis.

OmAb is currently used in allergic conditions other
than asthma, including chronic urticaria and food allergies [3]. Sera from a subset of patients with chronic
spontaneous urticaria (CSU) were demonstrated to activate normal basophils [7] and mast cells [8]. These
patients had IgG against the alpha subunit of the IgE
receptor or IgE itself [7-10]. The administration of
OmAb proved to be effective in a proof of concept
study carried out with a subset of 12 patients with CSU
and with antibodies against FceRI [11]. Furthermore,
after obtaining findings suggestive of IgE autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase (antithyroid peroxidase
Abs) [12], the first large multi-centre, double-blinded,
OmAb action on mast cells and basophils in vitro 93

 

and placebo-controlled study that was carried out with
OmAb for CSU, included patients with IgE antithyroid
antibodies, definitely supported the use of OmAb in
cases of CSU [13].

Unexpectedly, a small clinical trial also proved that
OmAb was equally effective for the treatment of
patients with non-autoimmune CSU [14]. Moreover, in
a subset of patients treated with OmAb, effectiveness
was reached within the first 24 to 48 h. These results
cannot be explained by the previously accepted mechanism of action of OmAb sequestering free IgE.

Eggel et al. recently reported on the ability of nonimmunoglobulin-based IgE inhibitor E2_79, a designed
ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin), and to a lesser extent
of that of OmAb, to dissociate pre-bound IgE from its
receptor in ex vivo basophils [15]. Our research further
explores the effect of physiological doses of OmAb on
this action, delving into its functional and signalling
consequences in mast cells and comparing them to that
of basophils. We also aimed to test our hypothesis that
this newly described activity of OmAb does not depend
on its immunoglobulin nature, using human IgG as a
control.

In order to perform such study, we first assessed the
ability of OmAb to decrease the level of pre-bound IgE
from mast cells and compared this to its ability in the
case of basophils. Thereafter, we measured mast cell
and basophil activation after the administration of the
OmAb treatment by means of several techniques, as
well as after an anti-IgE challenge to study the mediator release and synthesis, along with the signalling
cascade.

Understanding the mechanism of action of OmAb in
mast cells and basophils will potentially enable us to
find additional applications for this drug.

Cells and reagents

The LAD2 human mast cell line was provided by Drs.
A. Kirshenbaum and D.D. Metcalfe (National Institutes
of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) and grown in StemPro34 serum-free medium (Invitrogen Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with StemPro-34
Nutrient, L-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 U/mL),

the buffy coat from blood pertaining to non-atopic
donors. The donor blood was processed within the first
hour after its collection and was subsequently centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min, removing the serum. The
buffy coat was then collected and centrifuged again to
remove any remaining serum. The cells were re-sus

Cell activation

Mast cell activation was performed following the procedures described elsewhere [16]. Briefly, LAD2 cells were
sensitized overnight with IgE® (100 ng/mL) in culture
media. The following day, the cells were washed three
times in Tyrode’s buffer to eliminate unbound IgE, were
subsequently incubated with OmAb or higG at different
concentrations (high-dose experiments: 2, 1, 0.5, and
0.25 mg/mL; or low-dose experiments: 300, 100 and
30 g/mL) in culture media and for different periods of
time, and were then stimulated with streptavidin for
varying periods of time. Supernatants were collected for
CysLT measurement, and the cells were used for WB
analysis or FACS staining.

Basophil suspensions (50 utL) were incubated with
50 uL of OmAb or higG at different concentrations
(high-dose experiments: 2, 1 and 0.5 mg/mL; or low94 E. Serrano-Candelas et al

 

dose experiments: 300, 100 and 30 pg/mL) for 3, 12 or
24 h. After washing them three times with stimulation
buffer (Tyrode’s buffer containing 2 ng/mL IL-3), the
cells were stimulated with 1 pg/mL anti-human IgE or
stimulation buffer alone for 40 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped with 100 pL of stopping buffer
(20 mm HEPES, 133 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 0.27 mu
EDTA), and the tubes were centrifuged at 4°C at 900 g
for 5 min. The cells were then labelled for FACS
staining, and the supernatants were used for CysLT
measurements.

FACS staining

Mast cells were activated following the aforementioned protocol. Surface-bound biotinylated IgE and
FceRI were analysed by direct staining with STV-PE
or anti-FceRI-FITC, respectively, for 30 min at 4°C.
For the detection of CD63, IgE®-sensitized cells were
stimulated by incubation with 200 ng/mL STV for
30 min and, after being washed, were subsequently
stained with anti-CD63-FITC. The cell apoptosis
analysis was performed by incubation with AnnexinAPC and 7AAD for 15 min as described elsewhere
[17].

Basophil-bound CD63, FceRI, and IgE were determined by incubation with 20 pL of an HLA-DR-PerCPCy5.5, CD123-PE-Cy7, anti-IgE-FITC, anti-CD63-PE,
and anti-FcesRI-APC cocktail for 30 min at 4°C. Eryhrocytes were lysed with 2 mL of 10x pharm lysing
buffer (Becton Dickinson, Shannon, County Clare, Ireand) for 10 min in the dark. Cell lysis was stopped by
centrifugation at 900 g at 4°C for 5 min. The cells were
hen washed and re-suspended with 500 uL of stopping
buffer to perform the cytometric analysis. Cell apoptosis
was evaluated by incubation of Annexin-PE and 7AAD
for 15 min with cells that had been previously labeled with HLA-DR-PerCP-Cy5.5 and CD123-PE-Cy7.
Erythrocytes were lysed following the aforementioned
rocedure.

The cells were then analysed using a FACSCalibur or

a FASCCanto II flow cytometer (FACScan; BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA) and FlowJo Tree
Star software. In all cases, dead cells were gated out
based on the forward (FSC) and side scattering (SSC)
profile.

 

 

Immunoblotting

IgE®-sensitized cells (5 x 10° cells/sample) were incubated with OmAb or higG as described above. After
undergoing extensive washing, the cells were stimulated with 200 ng/mL STV for the indicated times (0, 1
or 5 min). Whole-cell lysates were obtained as described elsewhere [18], separated by SDS-PAGE and

electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). The blots
were probed with the indicated Abs. In all blots, proteins
were visualized with the aid of an ECL reagent (Advansta, CA, USA) and quantified using the Quantity One
software (Bio-Rad).

Cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) measurements

Mast cells were activated following the aforementioned
protocol. The IgE®-sensitized cells (2 x 10*/sample)
were subsequently incubated with OmAb or hlgG for
the indicated times, washed and seeded in 96-well
flat-bottom microtiter assay plates and stimulated with
200 ng/mL STV for 30 min at 37°C. The supernatants
were used to measure total CysLT levels using the Cysteinyl Leukotriene Express Competitive EIA Kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) following the
manufacturer’s protocol. The analysis was performed
in triplicate.

The supernatants (125 pL) from the basophil activation assays described above were used in the CysLT Cellular Antigen Stimulation Test (CAST ELISA, BithImann
Laboratories, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Results

OmAb removes surface IgE from mast cells and
basophils

High doses of OmAb have proven to be effective in
accelerating the dissociation of pre-bound IgE in
ex vivo basophils [15]. To explore this novel activity
in mast cells and its functional consequences, we first
analysed surface IgE in sensitized LAD2 cells after
removing free IgE and incubating the cells with OmAb
or higG as a control. Incubation of OmAb with the
IgE®-sensitized LAD2 cells reduced the pre-bound IgE
levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1).
higG had no effect on cell surface IgE levels, indicating the specificity for OmAb in this experiment. High
OmAb levels (2-0.5 mg/mL) were able to dissociate
pre-bound IgE as early as 4h (Fig. la-c); however, lower OmAb doses (100-30 j1g/mL), closer to the

to be effective (Fig. 1d). for different times and with varying doses of OmAb or

higG. After 24 h of incubation, bound IgE levels were
significantly decreased in the presence of OmAb
(Fig. 2a). Interestingly, we detected a significant IgE
dissociation as early as after 3 h of OmAb incubation
(Fig. 2b—c). Likewise, we observed a similar effect when
using low OmAb doses; however, a longer incubation
time was needed to achieve a significant dissociation of
IgE from the basophils’ surface (Fig. 2c).

OmAb removes IgE from FceRI in mast cells and
basophils without involving receptor endocytosis

To determine whether OmAb was able to reduce FcsRI
expression apart from dissociating IgE from its receptor,
we evaluated the receptor expression levels in mast
cells and basophils (Fig. 3). Both short- (4 h) and longterm (24 h) incubations with OmAb did not affect FceRI
expression in mast cells (Fig. 3a) in spite of causing a
drastic reduction of pre-bound IgE levels. However,
longer incubations (12—24 h) induced a decrease in the
levels of receptor expression in basophils (Fig. 3b). It
has been previously reported that monomeric IgE is
capable of stabilizing FceRI in the cell membrane and
of increasing its expression as a mechanism to amplify

(a)

its signal [20]. For this reason, it is important to note
that this effect on the reduction of FceRI expression is
likely a consequence of the absence of IgE bound to the
receptor, and not a direct effect of OmAb on the receptor’s expression.

Effects of OmAb in mast cell and basophil activation

Next, we studied the physiological relevance of IgE dissociation on mast cell activation, compared to the case
of basophil activation. To this end, IgE®-sensitized mast
cells were incubated with OmAb (or hlgG as a control)
for 4 h and were subsequently challenged with streptavidin (STV) for 30 min. As shown in Fig. 4a, OmAb
reduced mast cell degranulation, as measured by the
CD63 activation marker. OmAb per se does not affect
CD63 expression (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that OmAb also reduces cell activation as a
result of an increase in the levels of cellular apoptosis,
we determined whether mast cell viability was compromised in the presence of OmAb. Annexin V-7AAD
staining was performed in cells that were incubated
with human IgG or OmAb. No differences in cell viability
were observed (Fig. 4b).

Fig. 3. The reduction of pre-bound IgE from the cell surface is not due to a decrease in FceRI levels. (a) Histograms of surface FceRI staining of
previously sensitized LAD2 cells after incubation with OmAb for 4 and 24 h at different doses (black line). hIgG was used as a control (dotted

bar).

Under similar conditions, OmAb significantly reduced
basophil degranulation at different time points, as measured by means of CD63 staining, achieving significant
differences in CD63 expression after 24h of OmAb
incubation (Fig. 4c). Finally, similarly to the case of
mast cells, OmAb did not alter basophil viability
(Fig. 4d).

OmAb attenuates IgE-mediated activation of human
mast cells

In order to further examine this mechanism of action,
we analysed the phosphorylation status of IgE°-sensitized mast cells which were treated with OmAb. LAD2
cells were sensitized with IgE®, washed to remove
unbound IgE®, and incubated with OmAb for 4 h. Thereafter, the cells were challenged with STV for 1 or 5 min.
The cells were then lysed as described in section Material
and Methods, and their phosphorylation pattern was
evaluated by means of a western blot analysis. As shown
in Fig. 5a, global tyrosine phosphorylation was reduced
in the presence of OmAb (lanes 5-9) compared to the
case of cells that had been incubated without OmAb
(lanes 2-4). Moreover, this reduction in the pTyr signal

© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Clinical & Experimental Allergy, 46 : 92-102

proved to be dose-dependent. Human IgG, which was
used as a control, had the same effect on cells as that of
the incubation with media alone (lanes 10-14).

We subsequently evaluated the phosphorylation status of Syk, PLCy, LAT, and ERK, effectors of FceRIdependent events. The phosphorylation status of these
molecules was reduced, indicating that incubation with
OmAb decreased both proximal events regulated by
Syk, PLCy, and LAT, and downstream events governed
by ERK (Fig. 5a,b).

OmAb inhibits leukotriene release in mast cells and
basophils

ERK1/2 phosphorylates cytoplasmic phospholipase A2,
which is involved in the production of the eicosanoid
precursor arachidonic acid [21]. Leukotrienes are a product of the 5’ lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid
metabolism and are generated in leucocytes and other
immunocompetent cells, such as mast cells, eosinophils,
neutrophils, monocytes, and basophils. We therefore
assessed the ability of OmAb to inhibit leukotriene synthesis in mast cells and basophils. Our results demonstrated that OmAb inhibits cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT)

Basophils were stimulated with 1 jig/mL anti-IgE for 40 min, and CD63 expression was analysed. The bar charts represent the percentage of MFI for CD63 with respect to the OmAb/IgG untreated cells. The first bars indicate the negative

release in IgE®-sensitized mast cells (Fig. 6a) and basophils (Fig. 6b). Overall, our data prove that OmAb can
inhibit leukotriene synthesis and secretion, thus
explaining the ability of OmAb to reduce leukotrienes
during sustained inflammation in asthma and allergic
reactions [22-24].

Discussion

IgE plays a central role in the pathophysiology of allergic diseases. It was also recently proposed that IgE
plays a role in the amplification of inflammation
favouring the infiltration of immune cells into secondary lymphoid organs [25, 26]. OmAb is effective in
treating allergic diseases other than asthma, providing
new insights into unexpected roles for IgE [27-31]. In
the case of chronic urticaria, the exact mechanism of
OmAb is still unknown. Moreover, OmAb has been
reported to control physical urticarias [32-34]. Thus,
OmAb could have additional properties that act directly
on mast cells and basophils.

In this study, we described an OmAb activity in mast
cells that was already proposed to act in basophils [15].
This mode of action may be particularly relevant to
chronic urticaria, in which case mast cells play a key
role. We showed that OmAb inhibits mast cell activation
by mediating the reduction of IgE from its receptor. The
relevant experiments were performed side by side with
basophils. Inhibition occurred after only a few hours
and was consistent with the rapid response observed in a
minority subset of patients suffering from chronic urticaria that could not be explained by FceRI internalization resulting from the disappearance of free IgE. A
possible explanation for this result is that OmAb is able
to disturb the IgE-FceRI balance by rapidly sequestering
any free-IgE molecule. This hypothesis is supported by
the dissociation constant (Kd) reported for IgE:OmAb
(0.02—7 nm; which is dependent on the nature of the IgE
[35]) and IgE:FceRI (0.1 nm) complexes [36]). Thus,
OmAb would not only act by preventing new IgE from
binding, as stated for some time now, but also by
sequestering IgE from FceRI after it has already bound.

Fig. 5. OmAb incubation attenuates IgE-dependent signalling activation. LAD2 cells were sensitized with IgE® and subsequently incubated for 4 h
with OmAb or hlgG as a control. IgE was subsequently cross-linked with 200 ng/mL STV for the indicated times. (a) Specific mAb that recognizes phosphorylated-Tyr was used to analyse the general activation status. Specific mAbs against p-PLCyy7g3, p-Syky352, P-LATy191 P-ERKr292/
y204 Were used to analyse the phosphorylation status of these proteins in LAD2 whole-cell lysates. The total levels of these proteins were also measured, and B-actin was used as a loading control. (b) The bars graphics correspond to western blot quantitation by densitometry.

Furthermore, we found that OmAb not only inhibits
CD63 expression upregulation (a degranulation marker)
but also IgE-dependent proximal and distal signalling
events. In our study, Syk phosphorylation was reduced.
This kinase plays an essential role in early and late
mast cell responses by binding to the phosphorylated
FceRIy chain ITAMs after receptor aggregation, resulting in a conformational change that increases the enzymatic activity of Syk [37] and leads to downstream
signal propagation. Activated Syk phosphorylates LAT,
which acts as a scaffold for a multi-molecular signalling complex that includes PLCy, among other
molecules [38]. Therefore, we determined that the IgEdependent/Syk-LAT-PLCy signalling axis was affected
by the OmAb treatment.

Our data clearly demonstrate that OmAb also reduces
ERK phosphorylation and suppresses subsequent events,
such as leukotriene synthesis, in mast cells and basophils, which explains the effects of OmAb on sustained
inflammation in asthmatic patients [39].

Thus, we proved that OmAb can reduce IgE bound to
the cell surface of mast cells, causing a reduction of all
IgE-dependent events in a time- and dose-dependent
manner.

Our data show some experiments performed both at
supraphysiological doses (2 mg/mL (13 um) and
physiological concentrations (30 pg/mL (0.2 jm). With
regard to the doses of OmAb, pharmacodynamics data
[35] have demonstrated that after the administration
of a single subcutaneous dose of OmAb (300 mg), its
mean serum concentration is of 33.1 + 10.4 ug/mL,
(n = 23). In a study performed in a Japanese
population, Hayasi [19] obtained a serum concentration of 25-60 pg/mL after the administration of a
single dose of OmAb 300 mg, whereas Kornmann
[40] obtained a maximum serum concentration of
121.9 pg/mL after the administration of two doses of
OmAb 450 mg on day 1 and day 15 of the study.
The dose of OmAb is not adjusted to body weight
and IgE concentration for the treatment of chronic

Fig. 6. OmAb inhibits IgE-mediated leukotriene secretion. (a) LAD2
cells were sensitized overnight with IgE®, washed several times and
then incubated for 4 h with OmAb or hlgG as a control. Thereafter,
cells were challenged with 200 ng/mL STV for 30 min. Supernatants
were then used for cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) secretion quantification. The first bar indicates the negative control (IgE and OmAb/IgG
untreated cells). The data represent the mean + SD values of three
independent experiments. Statistical significance (*P < 0.05,
“P <0.01, ***P < 0.001) is relative to OmAb/IgG untreated cells. (b)
Primary basophils from healthy donors were pre-incubated with
OmAb or hIgG as a control for 24 h at different concentrations. The
basophils were then activated with anti-IgE for 40 min. The supernatants were used to measure CysLT levels. The first bar indicates the
negative control (OmAb/IgG untreated cells). The data represent the
mean + SD values of three independent experiments. Statistical significance (*P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001) is relative to OmAb/IgG untreated

urticaria, thus, OmAb plasma and tissue levels may
vary among individuals.

Regarding the mechanism of action of OmAb on
basophils, our results are consistent with those obtained
by Eggel and colleagues [15]. Our research data reflect
the physiological relevance of its action in mast cells
and a comparison for both cells: mast and basophils
with a physiological dose range of OmAb. While Eggel
used a concentration of 50 tm, we observed effects at a
concentration as low as 0.6 pM, which could be closer
to that of the skin’s physiological concentrations. In
addition, using IgG as a control, we proved that the
ability of OmAb to dissociate IgE was not a result of
its immunoglobulin nature. The same experiments
were performed with hlgG, instead of total hlgG to
determine isotype specificity, without observing any

differences (data not shown). Both the histidine and the
polysorbate contained in the OmAb solution as a diluent buffer were also analysed separately to rule out any
undesirable effect, with no significant differences being
found in this case either (data not shown).

It has recently been reported that OmAb does not
inhibit mast cell or basophil activation in vitro [41].
Gericke’s study was performed with low doses of OmAb
(10 pg/mL; 0.067 jm), with the mast cells and basophils
being incubated for 1h or 24h, respectively. Our
results are consistent with that of Gericke’s study, given
that no effects were observed in the mast cells or basophils at such doses. We believe that any differences
between both studies could possibly be explained by
this fact.

The differences in the kinetics of IgE dissociation of
mast cells and basophils that were observed in our
study may be partly explained by the nature of the IgE.
In human primary basophils, IgE is already bound to
their surface receptor. In the case of mast cells, LAD2
were incubated with a single IgE clone from the Abbiotec company. In addition, this different IgE dissociation
could also be explained by the differences between both
types of cells in terms of the time elapsed until the
decrease of FceRI expression, as reported elsewhere [5,
6].

We did not observe the induction of any cellular
apoptotic effects by OmAb per se in mast cells or basophils. However, monomeric IgE increases mast cell survival, mediator release, cytokine synthesis and FcsRI
expression [42, 43]. Thus, the depletion of bound IgE
may eventually decrease cell survival as well as FceRI
expression.

In conclusion, we proved that OmAb can dissociate
pre-bound IgE from its receptor, FceRI, in mast cells
and basophils. We also demonstrated that OmAb can
inhibit mast cell and basophil activation in vitro by
directly inhibiting early and late IgE-dependent phosphorylation events, consequently leading to a decrease
in pre-existing and newly synthesized mediators. This
additional mechanism of action of OmAb explains its
efficacy in controlling diseases such as chronic urticaria
as rapidly as within 24 h. Thus, our study provides new
information regarding the mechanism of action of
OmAb in mast cells and completes Eggel’s data on
basophils. However, the role of this drug in an IgEindependent context remains unclear.
