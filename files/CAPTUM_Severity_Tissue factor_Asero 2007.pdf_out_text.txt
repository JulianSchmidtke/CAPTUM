Background: In patients with chronic urticaria (CU), plasma
shows signs of thrombin generation and autologous plasma skin
tests score positive in as many as 95% of cases.

Objective: To evaluate the initiators of blood coagulation that
lead to thrombin generation and fibrinolysis in CU.

Methods: Activated factor VII, activated factor XII, fragment

F, 42, and D-dimer plasma levels were measured in 37 patients with
CU and 37 controls. Skin specimens from 10 patients with CU and
10 controls were tested for tissue factor immunohistochemically.
Results: Mean F +2 levels were higher in patients than controls
(2.54 [SD 2.57] nmol/L vs 0.87 [0.26] nmol/L; P <.001); disease
activity was moderate or severe in 9 of 11 (82 %) and 9 of 26 (35%)
patients showing high or normal Fj +2 levels, respectively (P <
-025). Mean D-dimer plasma levels were higher in patients than
controls (329 [188] ng/mL vs 236 [81] ng/mL; P <.01); disease
activity was moderate or severe in 6 of 8 (75%) and 11 of 29 (38%)
showing elevated or normal plasma D-dimer levels (P = NS).
Factor VIIa levels were higher in patients than controls (2.86 ng/
mL [0.66] vs 1.97 ng/mL [0.65]; P <.001). Activated factor VII
and F,,. levels were correlated (r = 0.529; P = .008). Tissue
factor reactivity was observed only in CU skin specimens.
Conclusion: The extrinsic pathway of clotting cascade is
activated in CU. Disease severity is associated with the
activation of the coagulation cascade.

Clinical implications: The involvement of the coagulation
pathway in CU opens new perspectives for a better
understanding of the pathogenesis and, possibly, for the

Key words: Chronic urticaria, coagulation, thrombin, D-dimer,
factor VII

Although the results of a number of in vitro studies performed during the last 15 years seem to suggest an autoimmune pathogenesis for chronic urticaria (CU), several
aspects remain ill defined or even contradictory. It is generally accepted that autoantibodies to IgE or to the high-affinity IgE receptor, FeeRI, which are commonly regarded
as the most relevant pathogenic factor in this disease, can
be detected in sera of a proportion ranging from 25%
to 50% of patients with CU.'®° We recently observed that
if autologous plasma anticoagulated with sodium citrate
rather than autologous serum is used to perform the intradermal test, the proportion of patients showing a skin response rises as much as 95%, suggesting that clotting
destroys a plasma factor that is somehow involved in the
skin reaction. In effect, we have demonstrated that plasma
from patients with CU frequently contains increased levels
of fragment F,+2, a marker of thrombin generation.’ An
increased responsiveness to sera of mast cells of patients
with CU, similar to that observed for basophils,* cannot
be ruled out. However, in experimental models, thrombin
was able to induce edema through an increase in vascular
permeability,’ an effect that, notably, is much reduced
by antihistamines and totally abolished if mast cell granules are depleted'®; moreover, thrombin triggers mast
cell degranulation'! and may activate protease activated
receptor | on mast cells.'? In rat mast cell populations,
the response to thrombin is equipotent with FceRI-mediated activation.'* Thrombin is the last enzyme of the coagulation cascade and is generated from prothrombin by
activated factor X in the presence of activated factor V
and calcium ions. The 2 pathways that initiate blood coagulation and lead to the activation of factor X are the contact
system and the tissue factor pathway. The activation of
contact system, also known as the intrinsic pathway, occurs when factor XII (Hageman factor) is activated by negatively charged surfaces and kallikrein. Activated factor
XII (FXIa) in turn converts prekallikrein into kallikrein
and factor XI into its activated form, which in turn activates factor IX, which, in the presence of activated factor

VIII, activates factor X. Measurement of FXIIa is a
reliable means to detect the in vivo activation of the contact
system in several human diseases.'* Factor VII is the first
factor of the other pathway, also called extrinsic. It forms a
complex with the membrane-bound tissue factor in the
presence of Ca**; this complex activates primarily factor
X.'> Once thrombin is generated, it acts on fibrinogen,
which is converted into fibrin that is then stabilized by factor XIIla and finally degraded by plasmin. In this study, we
have evaluated the contact and tissue factor pathways that
initiate blood coagulation by measuring activated factor
VII (FVIa) and FXIlIa in patients with CU. Prothrombin
fragment F, ;. was measured as marker of thrombin generation to get a complete overview of the coagulation cascade. Finally, we measured D-dimer levels as marker of
fibrin generation and subsequent degradation.

METHODS
Patients

Thirty-seven consecutive adult patients (male/female, 8/29; mean
age, 45 years; age range, 14-82 years) with CU seen at the allergy
department of the Clinica San Carlo (Paderno Dugnano, Italy) were
studied. CU was diagnosed on the basis of the appearance of
continuous or recurrent hives with or without angioedema for more
than 6 weeks.'® Patients with physical urticaria were excluded.
Disease activity was estimated according to the number of wheals
present at the time when blood samples from these 37 patients were
collected, as previously described”: 1 to 10 small (<3 cm in diameter) wheals = grade | (slight); 10 to 50 small wheals or | to 10 large
wheals = grade 2 (moderate); >50 small wheals or >10 large wheals =
grade 3 (severe); virtually covered with wheals = grade 4 (very
severe). All patients underwent intradermal testing with autologous
citrated plasma (autologous plasma skin test) and 31 of 37 with autologous serum (autologous serum skin test [ASST]) as well, as previously described.’ Na citrate—anticoagulated plasmas from all 37
patients with CU and from 10 normal subjects were stored in plastic
cones at —20°C until in vitro assays were performed. Citrated plasmas
from 37 normal subjects without a history of chronic urticaria were
used as controls in in vitro studies.

The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the
Declaration of Helsinki, and all subjects gave their informed consent
before participation.

Prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 measurement

Prothrombin fragment By<'8? was measured by a sandwich

ELISA (Enzygnost F;,2; Behring Diagnostics GmbH, Frankfurt,
Germany). Intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation (CVs)
were 5% and 8%, respectively.

D-dimer measurement

D-dimer levels were measured by 2 distinct methods. In the first,
plasmas from 21 patients were tested by a commercial latex

agglutination immunoassay kit (Instrumentation Laboratory Co,
Lexington, Mass). The degree of agglutination, directly proportional
to plasma D-dimer concentration, was determined measuring the
decrease of the transmitted light at 405 nm caused by the latex
aggregates.” Based on the calibration standards provided by the producer, levels < 278 ng/mL were considered negative. The positivelow and positive-high control standards provided with the batch used
in our experiments scored 395 ng/mL and 770 ng/mL, respectively.
In the second assay, plasmas from all 37 patients and 37 normal
controls were tested by ELISA (Zymutest D-dimer; Hyphen BioMed,
Neuville-sur-Oise, France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The intra-assay and interassay CVs were 10% and 15%, respectively.

FXila measurement

Plasma FXIIa levels were measured in plasma from all 37 patients
and 37 normal controls by a sandwich ELISA (Asserachrom FXIIa,
assay and interassay

 

Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres, France) with intraCVs of <7%.

FVila measurement

Plasma FVIla levels were measured in plasma from 24 patients
and 36 normal controls with a 1-stage prothrombin-time—based assay
using a truncated soluble form of recombinant tissue factor (kindly
supplied by Dr Nemerson, Mount Sinai Medical School, New York,
NY) that, on relipidation, reacts with FVIa, but not with 1-chain factor
VII”! The results were expressed as nanograms per milliliter referring
to a standard of recombinant FVIla (Novo Nordisk, Gentofte,
Denmark). Intra-assay and interassay CVs were 2.2% and 8.1%.

Immunohistochemical studies

In view of the results of F,,2, FVIIa, and D-dimer analyses
suggesting activation of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation, immunohistochemical studies were performed as well. Skin tissue specimens from 10 patients with active chronic urticaria who had been
evaluated to rule out urticarial vasculitis at the Dermatology Clinic
of the University of Milan were studied. These specimens were obtained during acute attacks and were fixed in formalin and embedded
in paraffin. Tissue specimens of normal skin from 10 patients who
underwent excision of benign skin tumors were used as controls.
Sections from paraffin-embedded skin tissue were tested for tissue

RESULTS
Patients

Disease activity was slight, moderate, or severe in 20,
14, and 3 patients, respectively. Thirty-six of 37 (97%)
patients scored strongly positive on the autologous plasma
skin test (in the remaining case there was only a slight
wheal-and-flare reaction). On the ASST, 10 patients
scored negative, 6 showed a slight reactivity, and 15
(48%) showed a marked wheal-and-flare reaction. The
only patient showing only slight skin reactivity on the
autologous plasma skin test scored negative on ASST.

Prothrombin fragment F,,

Prothrombin fragment F;,2 measurement results are
shown in Fig 1. On average, F; ,2 levels were significantly
higher in patients than in controls (2.54 [SD 2.57] nmol/L
vs 0.87 [0.26] nmol/L; P < .001; Table I). However, 2 patient populations could be clearly distinguished: 11 of 37
(30%) patients showed significantly elevated plasma
levels of fragment F, .., whereas the remaining 26 showed
normal Fj 2 levels. A moderate or severe disease activity
was present in 9 of 11 (82%) and 9 of 26 (35%) patients
showing high or normal F; +2 levels, respectively (P <
.025).

D-dimer

By latex agglutination immunoassay, plasma from only
2 of 21 (10%) patients contained increased D-dimer levels;

D-dimer was only slightly increased in one case (306 ng/mL)
and extremely high in the other one (2583 ng/mL; Table I).
Both plasmas contained increased Fj +2 levels, and these 2
patients showed a severe and moderate urticaria activity,
respectively.

By ELISA, mean D-dimer plasma levels were significantly higher in patients than in controls (329 [SD 188]
ng/mL vs 236 [81] ng/mL; P < .01; Table I). The D-dimer
plasma levels were elevated in 8 of 37 (22%) patients (Fig
2); these 8 included both patients showing elevated D-dimer levels on latex agglutination immunoassay. Notably,
only in 2 of 8 patients, D-dimer levels exceeded the normal
range provided by the producer (90-720 ng/mL). In 3
cases the D-dimer increase was associated with an increase in plasma Fj +. levels. A moderate or severe disease
activity was observed in 6 of 8 (75%) and 11 of 29 (38%)
patients showing elevated or low plasma D-dimer levels
(P = NS). D-dimer plasma levels were low in all normal
controls.

Plasma levels of FXIla were similar in all patients and
controls (mean, 0.80 ng/mL vs 0.80 ng/mL; P = NS;

Because of a limited sample supply, we could measure
FVIla only in 24 patients. Patients showed significantly

between FVIIa and fragment F,,> levels was found
(r = 0.529; P = .008).

tissue factor expression that was totally absent in normal
controls (Fig 5). Fig 6 shows the different patterns of tissue
factor reactivity in skin from patients with urticaria and in
normal skin. Urticaria skin lesions displayed a strong expression of tissue factor by upper dermal inflammatory
cells that was not present in normal skin.

DISCUSSION

There is some evidence that the coagulation cascade
might be involved in the pathogenesis of CU. Some
studies showed that heparin inhibits both the skin response
to autologous serum and histamine release from human
cultured basophils in vitro.2*?4 The immediacy of the
in vivo effect of heparin suggests that this should be caused
by a direct action at a cellular level or by a direct binding of
circulating histamine releasing factors and not by an interference with the intracellular system of second messengers. Importantly, heparin exerted its inhibitory effect
in vivo also in ASST-positive patients whose sera did
not induce any histamine release in vitro (ie, did not contain anti-FceRI or anti IgE autoantibodies), but did not inhibit the wheal-and-flare reaction induced by a SPT with
histamine or with a specific allergen extract in subjects
with allergy.”* A case of CU responding to the subcutaneous administration of heparin sodium (5000 U twice a day)
has been very recently reported.”° The beneficial effect of
the oral anticoagulant warfarin in patients with CU was
first observed in single case reports*°*’ and subsequently
confirmed by a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study”*; interestingly, all responders in the latter
study were negative on ASST, and the effects of the
drug were not associated with a modification of responses
to histamine and other mast cell mediators responsible for
the acute wheal-and-flare. Warfarin inhibits the synthesis

of vitamin K—dependent proteins in the clotting cascade
(ie, prothrombin, and factors VII, IX, and X).

This study provides further evidence of the possible
involvement of the clotting cascade in the pathogenesis of
CU. We confirmed our previous finding that plasmas from
a proportion of patients with CU, particularly those with a
more severe disease, show signs of thrombin generation as
supported by the elevated levels of fragment F; +2,’ but
also showed that in some cases, there is an activation of
fibrinolysis, as shown by the elevated D-dimer plasma
levels found in a proportion of patients. Accordingly
with the lack of thrombophilia in patients with CU, D-dimer levels were only slightly increased in all cases. Going
backward along the coagulation cascade, we showed that
the intrinsic pathway is not involved in CU, and demonstrated that thrombin generation is associated with an activation of the extrinsic (tissue factor) pathway. Our data
showing activation of factor VII and no activation of factor
XI are in line with early observations by Bork et al,”? who
found a reduction of factor VII associated with an increase
of factor XII in 10 patients with CU. These findings are
consistent with an activation and subsequent consumption
of factor VII but not of XII. The involvement of the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation was confirmed by our
immunohistochemical studies showing the expression of
tissue factor by upper dermal inflammatory cells in all
skin specimens from patients with CU and its absence in
normal skin. An association of disease severity with the
activation of the coagulation cascade was observed in
our patients. Patients showing elevated D-dimer and/or
F,.2 plasma levels showed a more severe disease in
most cases.

The sequence of etiologic and pathogenic events in
chronic urticaria is still insufficiently defined. If autoantibodies, complement, and mast cell-derived factors such
as histamine, tryptase, and/or different cytokines are
responsible for the activation of endothelial cells causing
tissue factor expression, then the observed activation of
the extrinsic coagulation pathway would be a secondary
consequence of urticaria, and thrombin might act as the

final actor amplifying the increase in vascular permeability observed in this disease. However, whatever the
mechanism of coagulation activation (primary or secondary), the presence of thrombin, an enzyme that increases
permeability of blood vessels, seems to play an important
role in the pathogenesis of CU. Moreover, a very recent
study has shown that thrombin is able to generate CSa in
the absence of C3, thus bypassing the entire first part of the
complement cascade.*” C5a has been demonstrated to amplify IgG-dependent histamine release from basophils in
chronic urticaria.*!

In conclusion, this study shows that the extrinsic
pathway of the coagulation cascade is activated in chronic
urticaria and that this activation appears to lead to thrombin generation. Our data provide the rationale for the
evaluation of anticoagulant drugs in the treatment of CU
and suggest further studies on the factors responsible for
the activation of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation in
patients with CU.
