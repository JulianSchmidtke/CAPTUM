BACKGROUND: Thyroid hormone
replacement therapy has previously been discussed as a feasible
therapeutic approach in patients
with chronic urticaria and/or
angio-oedema (CUA) and thyroid
autoimmunity (TA).

OBJECTIVE: The efficacy of levothyroxine was investigated in
patients with CUA and TA by comparing it with ketotifen treatment.

METHODS: A total of 60 patients
with CUA and TA were included in
the study. Patients were divided
into two groups, which were
matched with respect to sex, age
and symptom score. Each group
consisted of 30 patients. Patients
in one group were treated with
ketotifen and the other with
levothyroxine. After completion of
the treatment periods, the preand post-treatment symptom
scores, onset time of drug effects,

duration of symptom-free period,
recurrence ratios, recurrence
times and side effects were evaluated for each drug. The two drugs
were compared with each other
according to these parameters,
RESULTS: Ketotifen treatment provided significant relief of symptoms. However, these beneficial
effects were observed only in
ongoing treatment. Symptoms reappeared in all patients during
the drug-free follow-up period. On
the other hand, 18 of 30 patients
were completely improved and
three patients partially improved
with levothyroxine treatment.
Symptoms did not recur in the
completely improved patients.
CONCLUSION: Levothyroxine is an
important and inexpensive treatment alternative in patients with
CUA and TA. (J Dermatol Treat (2002)

Introduction

The association between chronic urticaria and/or angiooedema (CUA) and thyroid autoimmunity (TA) is well
defined. Thyroid hormone replacement therapy has been
previously suggested as a feasible therapeutic approach in
this group of patients.'* Although the beneficial effect of
levothyroxine has been proposed in some reports, there is
no published data that compares the efficacy of levothyroxine treatment with conventional antihistamine treatments.
We investigated the efficacy of levothyroxine in

patients with CUA and TA by comparing it with the antihistamine ketotifen.

Methods

Patient selection

Study participants were selected from 580 consecutive
out-patients with CUA, who were evaluated at GATA
Allergy Clinic, Ankara, Turkey. Diagnosis of CUA was
defined as recurrent episodes of ‘hives’ with or without
angio-oedema of at least 6 weeks duration, according to
the definition of Kaplan.’ Physical urticarias such as dermographism or pressure urticaria were not included. The
aetiology of CUA was evaluated by medical history, physical

examination and laboratory tests. The onset time of symptoms, duration of lesions, precipitating factors and systemic
symptoms, if any, such as fever, malaise, weight loss,
arthralgia and arthritis, were questioned. After a thorough
physical examination, laboratory investigations were performed to define CUA aetiology, including complete blood
count Coutler STKS Counter (Coulter Electronics, Miami,
Florida, USA), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (Westergren
Method), urine and stool microscopy, peripheral blood
smear, serum total eosinophil count, urea, creatinine, AST,
ALT, ALP, bilirubins, total protein, albumin (Technicon Dax
48 autoanalyzer (Bayer, Berkeley, California, USA), complement levels, CRP, RF (nephelometric assay), HbsAg, antiHCV, ANA, anti-dsDNA, chest and sinus X-rays, free T3,
free T4, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), antithyroglobulin antibody (anti-TG Ab) and antithyroid peroxidase antibody (anti-TPO Ab) (chemiluminescence method by using
DPC (Diagnostic Products corp., Los Angeles, California,
USA). Ultrasonographic examination of thyroid (thyroid
USG) was also performed in 40 patients with elevated
thyroid autoantibody levels (7.5 MHz linear probe; GE RT3600 (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA).
In addition to these laboratory tests, Helicobacter pylori infection was investigated by endoscopic or radionuclide techniques in those patients with chronic gastric complaints.

Elevated levels of thyroid autoantibodies were detected
in 70 out of 580 patients (12.06%). Since low levels of
thyroid autoantibodies are of uncertain significance in the
presence of normal thyroid function, an at least threefold
increase in anti-TG and/or anti-TPO antibody levels was
accepted as thyroid autoimmunity. These patients were
selected for the study. Exclusions included two patients
with other disorders that probably cause CUA, six patients
with contraindicated conditions for thyroid hormone
therapy (hypertension, ischaemic heart disease and older
age), and two patients who did not accept the levothyroxine treatment. The remaining 60 patients with CUA and
TA were included in the study.

Study protocol

Patients were divided into two groups which were matched
with respect to sex, age and symptom score. Each group
consisted of 30 patients. Patients in one group were treated
with ketotifen and the others with levothyroxine. The study
was designed as an open study. All patients were informed
about the study protocol and the effects and side effects of
the drugs, and their written consents were obtained before
the administration of drugs. Symptoms were recorded
before the administration of drugs, and every week during
ongoing treatment. Score recording was performed daily by
patients and the average score of the current week calculated by the physician in weekly control visits. The number
and duration of urticaria lesions, and the severity of itching
and angio-oedema were scored as mild, moderate, severe
and more severe (1: mild, 2: moderate, 3: severe and 4:
more severe; the maximum score was 16).

Ketotifen treatment

Ketotifen was given over a 6-week period. The drug was
administered at a dosage of 2 mg/day. Tablets were given
as a bedtime dose because of the sedative side effect of the
drug. On weekly control visits, symptom scores and side
effects of the treatment were recorded. The drug was discontinued at the end of the 6 weeks, and an overall evaluation was performed, Then, patients were followed-up
without any treatment.

Levothyroxine treatment

 

Levothyroxine was given for a 4-week period at a dosage
of 0.1 mg/day. The drug was administered on an empty
stomach 30 minutes before breakfast, since foods interfere
with gastrointestinal absorption. Patients were warned
about the importance of daily blood pressure and pulse
rate recording during levothyroxine treatment and asked
for phone visits when an unexpected effect occurred. On
control visits, the symptom score and side effects were
recorded, as for ketotifen treatment. After 4 weeks of
levothyroxine treatment, the levels of thyroid autoantibodies and TSH were measured again, and patients were
followed-up without any treatment.

In some patients, an additional 4-week levothyroxine
treatment was given. Levothyroxine was not re-administered in patients who did not respond to the total 8-week
trial.

Evaluation and comparison of the treatments

After the completion of the treatment periods, the pre- and
post-treatment symptom scores, onset time of drug effects,
duration of symptom-free period, recurrence ratios, recurrence times and side effects were evaluated for each drug.
In addition, the two drugs were compared with each other
according to these parameters.

The difference between pre- and _ post-treatment
symptom scores was defined as the ‘Improvement ratio’
(pretreatment symptom score — post-treatment symptom
score/pretreatment symptom score X 100 = improvement ratio, %). The treatment was accepted as successful,
unsuccessful and partially successful if the improvement
ratio was 100%, <50% and =50%, respectively.

Pre- and post-treatment thyroid autoantibodies and
TSH levels were compared in patients who received
levothyroxine. These parameters were also compared in
levothyroxine-treated patients who both benefited and did
not benefit from therapy.

All patients were followed-up for at least 6 months.
The longest follow-up period was 18 months

Statistical methods

Statistical analyses were performed by microprocessor
using statistical software package. Distribution of the data
was examined using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. It was

found that the distribution of the data was not normal.
Instead of transformation of the data and application of
parametric tests, non-parametric statistical methods were
chosen for comparison. The Wilcoxon signed ranks test for
paired samples data, the Mann-Whitney U test for
unpaired samples data, and the chi-squared test for frequency type data were used for comparisons.'”

All data in the text were expressed as mean + standard
deviation. The alpha was set to 0.05 in all calculations.

Results

Twelve male and 48 female patients with CUA and TA
were included in the study. The mean age was
37.87+12.20 years (19-63 years). Demographic and
clinical characteristics of the patients are summarized in
Table I.

Ketotifen treatment results

Complete improvement was obtained in 7 of 30 patients
during the 6-week period of ketotifen treatment. The pretreatment symptom score (11.70 + 2.39) was reduced to
6.80 + 4.57 post-treatment (Table II). The improvement
ratio was calculated as 41.90 + 36.61% (Table II),

Ketotifen treatment provided significant relief in the
number and duration of lesions, and itching and angiooedema. The difference between pre- and post-treatment
symptom scores was statistically significant (z = — 4.206,
p<0.001), However, these beneficial effects were observed
only in ongoing treatment. Symptoms re-appeared in
seven completely improved patients during the drug-free
follow-up period. Mean recurrence time was 4.71 + 3.09
days (1-10 days).

Side effects (sedation and/or weight gain) were
observed in 76.7% of patients, but none of them discontinued therapy because of adverse effects.

Levothyroxine treatment results

At the end of the 4-week period, 16 of 30 patients were
completely improved. In addition to these patients,
levothyroxine treatment was partially successful in
another six patients (improvement ratio >50%). On
follow-up, symptoms reappeared in five of the 16 completely improved patients. Mean recurrence time was
19,2+15.6 days (1-40 days); the symptom score was
5.8 + 4,1 among recurrences.

Levothyroxine treatment was re-administered to 11
selected patients (partially improved five patients, nonresponder two patients and four healed patients whose
symptoms recurred) for an additional 4-week period. This
second levothyroxine trial provided complete improvement in seven of the 11 patients. Symptoms did not recur
in these patients during long-term follow-up. Treatment
results of the 11 patients who received a total of 8 weeks
levothyroxine treatment are summarized in Table III.

With respect to the overall results (obtained after both
the 4-week and 8-week levothyroxine treatments), the
improvement ratio was 68.8 + 42.8%. Nine patients did
not respond to the therapy. Among the other 21 patients,
complete improvement occurred in 18 patients and partial
improvement in three patients (mean improvement ratio
was 65.1 + 4.1%). The pretreatment total symptom score
was 11.17 + 2.49 in this group of patients. The total score

was reduced to 3.00 + 4.62 with levothyroxine treatment.
This difference was statistically significant (z= —4.293,
p<0.001). The number and duration of lesions, and the
itching and angio-oedema were significantly reduced
(Table IV).

Anti-TG Ab levels were insignificantly reduced in five
patients (x* = 1.926, p=0.165), while anti-TPO Ab levels
remained unchanged. TSH was suppressed in all patients,
and thus a significant difference was found between
pre- and post-treatment TSH levels (z= —4.705,
p<0.001).

Rescue medication to alleviate symptoms was required
in only five patients. Hydroxyzine was preferred because of
its short duration of antihistamine action. It was used as a
single rescue dose when the symptoms affected daily activity or disturbed sleep. Rescue medication was generally
used within the first 2 weeks of levothyroxine treatment,
since onset of levothyroxine action takes at least 10 days.

Levothyroxine was tolerated well by all patients. Side
effects were only seen in a 28-year-old female patient. She
had her tachycardia relieved after dose reduction. All
patients completed levothyroxine treatment,

There were no significant differences between levothyroxine-responder and non-responder patients with respect
to gender, age, mean duration of disease and pretreatment
symptom scores (p= 1.000). In addition to these factors,

Patients who benefited from levothyroxine had higher

However, this phenomenon was not observed in anti-TG

Despite the presence of the ‘statistically’ insignificant

symptom score with levothyroxine treatment
(3.00 + 4.62) was significantly lower than ketotifen treatment (6.80 + 4.57) (z= —3.043, p=0.002), That indicates that levothyroxine is more effective in suppressing
the symptoms of urticaria and angio-oedema.

The improvement ratio was significantly higher with
levothyroxine treatment (z= —2.380, p=0.017). Only
seven patients benefited from ketotifen, whereas 21
patients benefited from levothyroxine (y?= 13.125,
p<0.001), In addition in those patients who responded to
treatment, symptoms recurred in all patients treated with
ketotifen, but only in five of 21 levothyroxine-treated
patients.

The differences between ketotifen and levothyroxine
treatments with respect to side effects were also significant. Side effects were observed in only 1 of 30 patients in
the levothyroxine group, but 23 of 30 patients complained
about the side effects in the ketotifen group (x? = 33.611,

Discussion

CUA negatively affects both the working and social lives of
patients because of its chronic relapsing course and poor
response to therapy. Despite advances in diagnostic
immunology, the aetiology of CUA remains uncertain in
most cases. Difficulty in determining the aetiology makes
treatment difficult. Dietary elimination, antihistamines
and corticosteroids provide only symptomatic relief, and
CUA usually recurs soon after discontinuation of treatment. Repeated courses of treatment also cause an
increase in costs, in addition to failure of a patient's expectations. Recent advances suggest that up to 50% of CUA
may be autoimmune. There is a wide spectrum of autoimmune processes associated with CUA. TA is one such
autoimmune disorder: an association that is well established, Several studies on this topic have been published
since 19831246

After establishment of the clear association between
CUA and TA, thyroid hormone replacement therapy has
been put forward by some authors. Thyroid hormone
replacement treatment was first used and published by
Leznoff et al.' Results of levothyroxine treatment trials are
summarized in Table VII.%

Beneficial effects of levothyroxine in this group of CUA
patients have been implicated in many of these studies. A
trial of levothyroxine treatment has been recommended in
CUA patients with TA, especially those who are resistant
to conventional therapies. However, the superiority of this
therapy over other common therapeutic modalities used
for CUA is unclear. There is no study that compares conventional CUA treatments and levothyroxine treatment.

Since CUA has a chronic relapsing course despite intensive
treatments, the aim of the ideal CUA treatment is to
provide long-term remission. In this respect, there is no
exact data about the long-term results of levothyroxine
therapy in CUA patients with associated TA.

One of the drugs evaluated in this study was ketotifen,
Ketotifen is a safe ‘anti-allergic’ drug which is unavailable
in the USA but is in extensive use in Europe. It is safe in
almost all age groups and appropriate for long-term treatments. It has a variety of actions in addition to its histamine receptor blocking activity, such as inhibition of the
release of the mediators of anaphylaxis and its calcium
antagonist effect. Ketotifen may help in cases of chronic
urticaria where other antihistamines have failed, The
onset of ketotifen activity is slow: 4—6 weeks are required
to achieve full prophylactic value. For this reason our
patients received ketotifen for 6 weeks,'''*

With respect to our results, ketotifen is unlikely to be a
reasonable treatment for patients with CUA and
TA. Symptoms disappeared within 6 weeks in only seven
patients and it provided partial relief (improvement ratio is
less than 50%) in the rest of the patients. Furthermore, in
all patients on ketotifen, symptom scores returned to pretreatment significance soon alter ceasing the drug. On the
other hand, an appropriate CUA treatment must enhance
quality of life for the patient. That means side effects of the
selected drug must be acceptable. But unfortunately, sedation, which is the most frequently observed side effect of
ketotifen, had a greater adverse effect on quality of life
than CUA activity in our patients.

Levothyroxine treatment provided complete improvement in 18 of 30 patients. In addition, partial improve

ments were obtained in three patients. Beneficial effects of
levothyroxine were observed alter the second week of
treatment in many patients. The post-treatment total
symptom score was significantly lower than the ketotifen
treatment. This was considered as the proof of superiority
of levothyroxine treatment in TA-associated CUA.

Levothyroxine not only effectively suppressed CUA
symptoms, but also provided a long-lasting disease-free
period in many patients. Recurrence of symptoms was
observed in all patients after ketotifen treatment, but only
31.25% of levothyroxine-benefited patients experienced a
recurrence following 4 weeks of levothyroxine treatment.
Furthermore, a prolonged symptom-free period was also
obtained in some patients who received an additional 4
weeks of levothyroxine treatment (up to 18 months).

Nine patients did not benefit from levothyroxine treat
ment. The only difference between these patients and nonresponders were higher pretreatment anti-TPO Ab levels.
Thyroid autoantibodies are commonly detectable even in
normal subjects, and anti-TPO Ab is more sensitive in the
diagnosis of autoimmune thyroiditis.'> It may be speculated that patients who did not benefit from levothyroxine
probably did not have autoimmune thyroiditis. If we were
able to perform thyroid biopsies, we could have more
explanatory data, but not surprisingly most of the study
patients did not accept thyroid biopsy.
Our results justify the association between TA and
CUA, and the beneficial effects of levothyroxine in CUA
patients, but the mechanisms of how levothyroxine alleviates urticaria and angio-oedema are still a mystery.
Thyroid antibodies themselves were not responsible for
CUA lesions. The differences between pre- and post-treatment thyroid autoantibody levels did not correlate with
the clinical activity. These autoantibodies only serve as an
indicator of autoimmunity, as repeatedly concluded
be! ore,23:6.16

It could be speculated that levothyroxine itself may be
responsible for clinical remission of urticaria and angiooedema. This hypothesis was not confirmed by Goldberg et

 

 

al!’ in that they found no significant difference in the
wheal-and-flare response to compound 48/80, codeine
and histamine in patients with hyperthyroidism compared
with healthy controls. It is also unlikely that levothyroxine itself has an effect on mast cell stability. Rumbryt et al
reported that three patients with CUA without TA did not
respond to thyroid hormone, while another seven patients
with TA did.?

More recently, Bar-Sela and colleagues'* described a
case of chronic urticaria associated with the presence of
IgE anti-TPO antibody. They proposed that in certain
patients these specific autoantibodies may sensitize mast
cells, which on encountering the specific circulating
antigen (TPO Ag), will degranulate. This unrecognized
finding may provide a possible explanation for the underlying mechanism in patients with CUA associated with
TA. In our study, we did not measure the serum total IgE
level in all patients since this kind of effort has been postulated as unrewarding in the literature.'’ Serum total IgE
was elevated in only one of seven randomly selected
patients. This patient was also atopic and suffered from
allergic rhinitis.

The most possible explanation of the beneficial effects
of levothyroxine on CUA is suppression of chronic thyroid
stimulation and glandular inflammation, which has been
previously proposed.’ Factors responsible for and generated from the recruitment of inflammatory cells such as
proinflammatory cytokines and __histamine-releasing
factors, may decrease the mast cell threshold to endogenous peptides or exogenous allergens or stimulants. Treatment with levothyroxine decreases thyroid stimulation
through reduction of TSH. Suppression of TSH was also
detected in our study. However, this finding is not valuable since it is a physiological effect of exogenous thyroid
hormones and is observed in all study participants.

Depending on our results and the literature review, the
following suggestions are offered: Thyroid autoimmunity
must be screened in all patients with CUA, especially those
with a personal or family history of thyroid disease.

Levothyroxine versus ketotifen

 

Thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be considered in all patients with TA-associated CUA, even if
they are euthyroid. This intervention is safe because a 4week levothyroxine trial does not cause any significant
alteration in thyroid function. A dose of 0.1 mg of levothyroxine per day is usually appropriate. The dose may be
modified according to the patient's age and thyroid function. Although 4 weeks of levothyroxine treatment is
usually sufficient, treatment may be prolonged to 8 weeks
if the response to therapy is still poor. If there has been no
response by a total of 8 weeks of administration, levothy
 

roxine should be discontinued. Levothyroxine is not indicated in CUA patients without thyroid autoimmunity.

In summary, levothyroxine is an important and inexpensive treatment alternative in about 14% of CUA
patients. Although the mechanisms responsible for
urticaria and angio-oedema in thyroid autoimmunity and
for levothyroxine effect are uncertain, levothyroxine treatment should be tried in CUA patients with TA, so long as
there is no contraindication for thyroid hormone replacement.
