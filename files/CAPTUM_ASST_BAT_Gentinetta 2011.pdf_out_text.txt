Background: The in vivo autologous serum skin test (ASST) is
the diagnostic gold standard to detect autoantibodies against Abbreviations used

FceRI or IgE itself, as well as other autoreactive serum ASST: Autologous serum skin test
components, in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria
(CU). Coincubation of patient sera with donor basophils and
measuring their degranulation in vitro could be a safe
alternative but has shown inconsistent results.

Objective: Optimization of the basophil activation test to detect
autoreactive serum components in patients with CU.

Methods: The ability of patient sera to induce CD63 and
CD203c in donor basophils (n = 15) was measured by means of
flow cytometry. Sera of 20 patients with CU (10 with positive
ASST results), 15 patients with cold urticaria, and 27 healthy

Additionally, the fact that several basophil donors are needed to
establish the test for daily routine diagnostics has not been
investigated in detail. Basophil cell lines have rarely been used in
this respect and did not show consistent results when tested in the
setting of atopic disease.”? There is only 1 report describing the
use of humanized RBL cells to measure B-hexosaminidase release from heat-treated sera of patients with CU.'° More recently,
Nakamura et al** demonstrated the toxicity of higher human serum concentrations for RBL SX-38 cells, which was in part because of complement activation.

The main goal of this study focused on the BAT was to define the
relevant parameters influencing test accuracy compared with that
of the ASST as the current diagnostic gold standard. We systematically investigated different test conditions (cell separation and
activation markers) and donor basophil characteristics (IL-3
sensitivity and IgE receptor density). Here we present, for the
first time, an optimized test procedure of the BAT in patients with
CU as an open-source protocol suitable to be implemented into
routine laboratory diagnostics whereby human donor basophils
could not be replaced by the basophil cell line used in this study.

METHODS
Serum samples of patients and healthy control
subjects

Serum samples from 110 patients (67 women and 43 men; mean age, 42
years; age range, 12-77 years) with CU, which is defined as the spontaneous
appearance of typical skin lesions at least 3 times a week for a minimum of 6
weeks without an identified cause, were recruited from our outpatient
Department of Allergology in Bern, Switzerland. Patients with physical
urticaria and urticarial vasculitis were excluded. Twenty-seven healthy
subjects without urticaria (18 women and 9 men; mean age, 39 years; age
range, 21-61 years) served as negative healthy control subjects. Additionally,
we included 15 patients with cold urticaria (8 women and 7 men; mean age, 41
years; range, 28-59 years) as a further control group. All serum samples were
stored at —20°C. All patients provided informed consent, and the study was
approved by the local ethics committee.

ASST

ASST was performed according to international consensus.** Briefly, 0.2
to 0.3 mL of autologous serum, drawn and centrifuged immediately before
testing, was injected intradermally (undiluted and 1:10) into the volar aspect
of both forearms, avoiding skin areas affected within the last 24 hours.

Histamine and codeine (2 mg/mL; Allergopharma AG, Hamburg, Germany)
and normal saline served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Results were evaluated 30 minutes after injection and were considered positive
if the wheal diameter exceeded the injection wheal by 1.5 mm and was accompanied by a flare reaction.

Basophil donors

We recruited 15 healthy basophil donors (8 women and 7 men; mean age,
36 years; age range, 25-57 years; Table I). Five basophil donors were atopic
based on history and skin test results to grass, weed, and birch pollen and house
dust mites. Four were nonresponders lacking CD63 upregulation after stimulation with anti-IgE as a positive control; those donors were excluded from further analysis.

FceRI density on the surface of donor basophils

To determine the surface density of FceRI on donor basophils, we used
QIFIKIT (Dako-Cytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) for quantitative flow
cytometry, as described elsewhere.”°

BAT

All reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich (Buchs, Switzerland) unless stated
otherwise. PBMCs were isolated from fresh heparinized peripheral blood by
means of density gradient centrifugation and resuspended in assay medium
(RPMI-1640, 1 mmol/L CaCh, | mmol/L MgCh, and 1% BSA) to a final concentration of 5 X 10° cells/mL. An individual concentration of IL-3 was added
for each basophil donor. One hundred microliters of cells resuspended in the appropriate IL-3 medium was incubated with either 100 L of patient serum or
100 wL of a healthy control serum for 30 minutes at 37°C. Anti-IgE (100 ng/
mL; Beckman Coulter, Marseille, France) and assay medium served as positive
and negative controls, respectively. In some experiments basophils were stimulated with N-formy|-methiony]l-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP; 2.5 nmol/L) as
an additional IgE-independent positive control. The cells were stained with
anti-CCR3-allophycocyanin, anti-CD63-fluorescein isothiocyanate, and
anti-CD203c—phycoerythrin, all of which were from BioLegend (San Diego,
Calif), for 20 minutes at 4°C. Cells were washed in CellWASH and fixed
with 1% paraformaldehyde. Basophils were acquired according to their granularity and CCR3 expression*® on a FACSCanto. CD63 and CD203c served as
activation markers and were expressed as the percentage of activated basophils.

Characterization of IL-3 sensitivity in donor
basophils

To define the IL-3 sensitivity of a given basophil donor, we prepared
different assay media with varying IL-3 concentrations (10-0.1 ng/ml
J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL
VOLUME 128, NUMBER 6

BioLegend) or without IL-3 for the subsequent BAT. The criteria to determine
the optimal IL-3 concentration for a given basophil donor were that healthy
control sera led to less than 5% upregulation of CD63 and optimal basophil
reactivity with positive controls.

Basophil cell line

The human FceRI-transfected RBL cell line RBL-703/21 was generated at
Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (Langen, Germany)’ and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Lonza, Switzerland) supplemented with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (Gibco
[now Life Technologies], Carlsbad, Calif), 5% neonatal heat-inactivated calf
serum (Sigma-Aldrich), and | mg/mL geneticin sulfate (G-418; SigmaAldrich). The cells were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO, atmosphere. RBL
cell lines were harvested for use on reaching 85% to 95% confluence.

B-Hexosaminidase release assay

The B-hexosaminidase assay was performed as described by Vogel et al,””
with some modifications. All reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich unless stated
differently. RBL-703/21 cells were harvested by using 1 X trypsin-EDTA solution, resuspended in the growth medium described above, seeded into Nunc
96-well cell-culture plates at 1.5 X 10° cells per well with or without sensitization with purified monoclonal human IgE (AbD Serotec, Oxford, United
Kingdom), and grown overnight at 37°C in a 5% CO atmosphere. The following day, the cells were washed twice with modified Tyrode buffer with 10
mmol/L CaCl, (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, United Kingdom)
and | g/L BSA adjusted to pH 7.45 with NaOH. Cells were stimulated with
100 wL of allergen challenge buffer, a mixture of 50% modified Tyrode buffer
and 50% deuterium oxide (vol/vol) containing different dilutions of patient or
control serum. Total B-hexosaminidase release was determined by comparison
with cells treated with lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100). Cells treated with
1 pg/mL A23187 (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) together with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 wmol/L) or | pg/mL polyclonal goat anti-IgE
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif) in allergen challenge buffer were
used as positive degranulation controls. Colorimetric quantification of B-hexosaminidase activity was performed as described by Vogel et al.7’

Detection of IL-3 in sera

Detection of IL-13 was done according to the manufacturer’ s protocol with
the human IL-3 Flex Set (BD Cytometric Bead Array; BD, Franklin Lakes,
NJ). Flow cytometric analysis was performed with a FACSCanto.

Statistical analysis

Data analysis was performed with FlowJo (version 9.2; Tree Star, Inc,
Ashland, Ore) and Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc, La Jolla, Calif)
software. The 2-tailed Mann-Whitney test was applied, where appropriate.
Correlations were analyzed by using the nonparametric Spearman test.
Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to calculate
the optimum cutoff value. P values of less than .05 were considered
significant.

RESULTS
BAT with basophils of a single donor coincubated
with different sera

As a proof of concept and according to the literature,'*"'* basophils of 1 randomly selected donor were coincubated with patient
sera (n = 67, 16 with positive ASST results) and healthy control
sera (n = 27), and CD63 upregulation was measured. In these donor basophils sera from patients with CU with positive ASST results induced a median CD63 upregulation of 15.7% + 7.4% (+
SEM) compared with 3.7% + 1.15% in sera from patients with
CU with negative ASST results and 1.1% + 0.15% in healthy

www.jacionline.org).

Individual basophil response in different basophil
donors

Several basophil donors are needed to establish the test for
routine diagnostics. Sera of 2 representative patients and
1 healthy control subject were each coincubated with 11
different basophil donors to ensure test reproducibility (Fig 1).
We observed a high interindividual variability of BAT results between the different basophil donors with limited correlation to
the respective ASST result and, even more disturbing, falsepositive results in certain basophil donors if coincubated with
healthy control serum.

The mean IgE receptor (FceRI) density of each basophil donor
had no influence on the degree of basophil degranulation (see Fig
E2 in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org) and
was therefore not responsible for the observed discrepancy.

It is well known that basophil reactivity is enhanced by IL-37*;
however, its concentration in the tested sera of patients and basophil donors is low (<5 pg/mL, see Fig E3 in this article’s Online
Repository at www.jacionline.org). In IL-3 titration experiments
we could demonstrate an individual IL-3 sensitivity of each basophil donor. All tests were initially performed in the presence of the
standard IL-3 concentration of 1 ng/mL. The standard IL-3 concentration of 1 ng/mL led to false-positive results with healthy
control sera in certain basophil donors (Fig 2, A).

Individual basophil priming with IL-3 is crucial
To define an optimal IL-3 concentration for each basophil
donor, avoiding false-positivity, we used 10 healthy control sera

(Fig 2, A) and IgE-dependent (anti-IgE) and IgE-independent
(fMLP) stimuli (Fig 2, B). As expected, anti-IgE elicited
IL-3-sensitive basophil degranulation characteristics, whereas
IgE-independent stimuli ((MLP) were independent of the IL-3
concentration used. Importantly, there was no unspecific upregulation of CD63 with IL-3 alone (Fig 2, C). Under optimal IL-3
concentrations, neither healthy control sera nor sera of patients
with cold urticaria elicited basophil activation (<5.1%; median,
2.5% + 0.4%).

If the individual basophil priming with IL-3 was optimized for
each basophil donor, testing with the defined patient sera mentioned above resulted in an improved interassay agreement
irrespective of the basophil donor used. The results are shown
for the patients with negative ASST results (Fig 3, A and B) and
the patients with positive ASST results (Fig 3, C and D)
separately.

Intraindividual variability of basophils over time
We further investigated the variability of IL-3 sensitivity and
basophil degranulation characteristics over time within a given
basophil donor. Therefore we stimulated basophils from several
donors with sera from healthy control subjects, with sera from

patients with CU, and with unspecific stimuli in July (middle of
the grass pollen season) and October (out of the pollen season).
There were slight but insignificant fluctuations in basophil
reactivity over time, with comparable results at the 2 time points
for patient and healthy control sera (Fig 4, Table II, and see Fig E4
in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). Only
on anti-IgE stimulation and restricted to the 2 atopic donors investigated could we detect a statistically significant difference of basophil reactivity over time (P = .02).

CD203c as an alternative basophil activation marker

We analyzed CD203c instead of CD63 as an alternative
activation marker on donor basophils, as recommended by
others.'* We coincubated 2 sera of patients with positive ASST results and 4 healthy control sera with basophils from different donors (see Fig ES in this article’s Online Repository at www.
jacionline.org). IL-3 could not be included in this approach because IL-3 alone leads to an enhanced expression of CD203c.”°
In contrast to the results obtained with CD63, the discrimination
between healthy control sera and sera from patients with positive
ASST results was no longer possible in certain basophil donors.

but with sera of patients with positive ASST results.

Putting the diagnostic system to the test

After the optimization of the BAT for CU diagnosis described
above, we analyzed sera of patients with CU (n = 110) with ASST
results available recruited from our outpatient department in Bern
from January 2010 until January 2011. In this evaluation period
basophils derived from all basophil donors described above were
used according to the donors’ availability. The optimal positivity
threshold defined by receiver operating characteristic analysis
was 7.7% activated basophils after incubation with patient sera.
With this cutoff, the test result was positive in 53 of the 110 patients tested. We included a second method for cutoff determination by using the mean plus twice the SD, which resulted in a
comparable cutoff point (6.7%). In these basophils from several
donors, sera from patients with CU with positive ASST results induced a median upregulation of CD63 of 26.5% + 5.3% (+
SEM) compared with 8.36% + 1.1% in sera from patients with
CU from negative ASST results (n = 87) and 3.7% + 0.2% in
healthy control sera (n = 27). Thus the overall picture is comparable with the data obtained by using only 1 basophil donor. Fig 5
summarizes the BAT results of all cases compared with the respective ASST results.

Insufficient sensitivity of RBL703/21 cells as an
alternative to human basophils

Sera were also tested by using the humanized basophil-like cell
line RBL 703/21. One hour after stimulation with different
dilutions (1:10, 1:100, and 1:1000) of patient or control sera,
B-hexosaminidase activity released into the supernatant was
determined and expressed as a percentage of total content determined by means of lysis (data not shown). We found no consistent
differences between control and patient sera, and positive results
were only obtained with the higher, potentially cytotoxic concentration of serum, as described by Nakamura et al.?? Thus the use of
the basophil-like cell line in its current form does not appear to be a
viable alternative to the method presented in this article.

DISCUSSION

BAT with well-characterized donor basophils can be used in
clinical routine for the detection of autoreactive serum components and might replace the ASST in a reliable and safe way. In
contrast to ELISA, which cannot discriminate between autoantibodies of low and high affinity or detect the presence of an

might allow such a conclusion. However, we substantiated the

a low interlaboratory agreement. To reduce this variability by using only a single basophil donor is not feasible in laboratory routine for a disease as prevalent as CU. An alternative would be to
use a suitable cell line. Unfortunately, in our hands the humanized
RBL703/21 basophil-like cell line used in conjunction with
8-hexosaminidase determination did not provide consistent results and did not reliably discriminate positive from control
sera. Therefore recruiting and characterizing several basophil donors is currently the only solution for an application in routine
diagnostics.

In contrast to other studies,’ we used density-separated
and washed leukocytes instead of whole blood and thereby
avoided possible interference of donor-derived plasma factors,
such as interleukins. Second, we focused on CD63 upregulation.
CD203c¢ as an alternative activation marker led to variable activation patterns, rendering the discrimination between patient and
healthy control sera impossible in certain basophil donors. Furthermore, those variations could not be normalized by individual
IL-3 concentrations (see below) because IL-3 by itself leads to
CD203c upregulation. Furthermore, in contrast to CD203c,

3,14,17

CD63 is directly linked to basophil degranulation.*° Therefore
CD203c is less suitable for this test purpose (see Fig ES).

The primary challenge was to eliminate the variability in
basophil reactivity between the different donors. From our initial
experiments, we could observe a high reactivity in certain
basophil donors, even reacting with healthy control sera. Therefore we focused our investigation on the definition of basophil
donor characteristics. The mean IgE receptor density of the
individual basophil donor did not significantly influence the test
result (see Fig E2). The mean IgE receptor density alone is not responsible for the magnitude of basophil degranulation. There are
several other, mainly intracellular factors playing a role in the basophil activation process.*! Therefore we investigated the role of
IL-3, which activates the Ras pathway through Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5*° and leads to an enhanced basophil degranulation.?*** Some authors claim that IL-3
has to be avoided to improve test specificity.'® Indeed, this is the
case in certain atopic basophil donors, in whom autocrine IL-3
priming might have already enhanced basophil reactivity,** and
this phenomenon was already described for the histamine release
test.*> In our patients and basophil donors, IL-3 in sera was hardly
detectable (see Fig E3), which is in concordance with earlier results.*° Most cytokines are produced locally and have a predominantly local activity. Local tissue concentration of IL-3, as well
as those of other cytokines, can only be estimated and might
well be in the high nanogram range.*’ In contrast, nonatopic donors require IL-3 to achieve a comparable degranulation and histamine release of basophils.** To define the optimum test
condition for each basophil donor, we adjusted the IL-3 concentrations with respect to avoidance of false-positive results (<5%
CD63 upregulation if coincubated with healthy control sera)
and conservation of activation characteristics (with anti-IgE as
a positive control) at the same time. By individually priming
the basophils with no, low, medium, or high concentrations of
IL-3, we were able to normalize the basophil reactivity in all 11
basophil donors (Fig 3, B and D) and to achieve reproducible
and comparable test results irrespective of the basophil donor
used. Importantly, and as well reported by others, IL-3 alone
never led to nonspecific basophil degranulation.2*°

Ina given basophil donor no variability of IL-3 sensitivity was
observed over time (Fig 4 and see Fig E4), and the CD63 upregulation was reproducible when analyzed at different time points
(Table II). Table I summarizes the characteristics of our basophil
donors and is used as an internal test validation tool in our laboratory. For each test round, we controlled for the donor-specific
activation characteristics. Again, within the same basophil donor,
the results with our positive controls (anti-IgE and fMLP) were
comparable (Table II). Of note, we observed a slightly higher
CD63 upregulation during the pollen season only in the atopic basophil donors, but it reached statistical significance only with antiIgE stimulation.

We and others*° observed a discrepancy between ASST and
BAT results in certain patients (Figs 3 and 5). Nevertheless,
the BAT results for the single patient were consistent within
all 11 basophil donors tested. Probably this observation is due
to an inaccuracy of the ASST. In the group with negative
ASST results, comedication can influence the skin test results,
such as unreported antihistamine or antidepressant intake,*' as
for example patient 299, who was taking trimipramine and paroxetine and consecutively only had positive BAT results. In
the group with positive ASST results, mast cell hyperreactivity

with pronounced dermographism might exert a relevant influence on the result of intradermal skin testing. Importantly, for
obvious reasons, neither positive nor negative control sera can
be injected into the patient’s skin, and therefore there are no
true controls possible in the ASST. Those limitations of the
ASST as the diagnostic gold standard hamper the calculation
of test accuracy, and the result is likely to be biased on patient
selection. However, because we have not observed false-positive

results in healthy control sera, our test protocol seems to be specific and to not overestimate the rate of autoreactive components
in patient sera. This was also supported by the absence of basophil activation with sera of patients with cold urticaria. As a typical form of physical urticaria, cold urticaria is thought to be
associated with bacterial and viral infections and independent
of autoreactive serum components." Overall, there are several
advantages over the ASST: no risk of accidental infection, no influence of antihistamines on the test result, quantifiable results,
and a potential in providing treatment monitoring.

The exact nature of the degranulating factor or factors in patient
sera remains an open question. Autoantibodies of IgG or IgM
isotypes have been postulated.**# Other probably important factors in the pathogenesis of CU, such as coagulation or complement split products or even cytokines, cannot be safely
excluded.*°* CU, especially in its most severe and refractory
form, might have more than | pathogenetic factor. Our optimized
assay seems to be able to detect most, if not all, of them in a robust
and correct way. Hence it might allow for a separate analysis and
dissection of the pathogenetic cascade, ultimately leading to the
chronic appearance of urticarial lesions. More investigations are
needed to dissect the different activation cascades and lead to optimized and individualized treatment.

for providing RBL-703/21 cells. We thank B. Schnyder for critical revision
and discussion and all our blood donors for their continuing support.

Clinical implications: The BAT might be a replacement for the
ASST, lacking the risk of accidental infection and the influence

of antihistamines on the result. Quantifiable results and the potential use in treatment monitoring are additional advantages.
