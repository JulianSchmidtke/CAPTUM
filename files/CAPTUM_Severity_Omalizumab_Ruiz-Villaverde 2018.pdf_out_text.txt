Omalizumab for the treatment of chronic spontaneous
urticaria in daily clinical practice in South Spain

Dear Sir,
Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized anti-lgE monoclonal antibody that binds the IgE molecule in the region assigned to the target
cell receptor. Its main action lies in the reduction of plasma-free IgE
levels and an indirect decrease in the number of high-affinity IgE
receptors of basophils and mast cells (Metz et al., 2017).

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) represents approximately
70% of all chronic urticarias. In 2009, the EAACI/GA(2)LEN/EDF/

WAO international guidelines were published with the idea of

unifying the definition, classification, diagnosis, and treatment of
urticaria according to scientific evidence in literature, considering the
experience in Europe and around the world (Zuberbier et al., 2009). In
2013, the document was revised and updated and today comprises
the agreed-upon European guidelines for the management of chronic
spontaneous urticaria (Zuberbier et al., 2014).

The main goal of this study is to describe the usage patterns and
therapeutic response of UCS patients to omalizumab in real-world

clinical practice at five dermatology departments and one allergology

department in the autonomous region of Andalusia, located in the
south of Spain. The secondary goal is to describe the epidemiological
and clinical characteristics of evaluated patients.

Five dermatology departments and one allergology department
from the autonomous region of Andalusia in the south of Spain participated in this study. In this study, we included 64 patients aged above
18 years who were diagnosed with chronic spontaneous urticaria.
They underwent treatment with omalizumab during a period between
July 2015 and May 2017. All patients in this series of cases received
omalizumab by subcutaneous injection in an initial dose between
75 and 300 mg. In order to be included in this study, patients had to
complete at least 6 months of treatment and present for a minimum
follow-up period of 1 year at the referral department.

Demographic and disease history data were collected for each
study patient. Response to treatment was measured by the UAS7
score at baseline and every 3 months. Lack of response to treatment
was considered when the UAS7 score was greater than 6 (Figure 1).

Severity data (UAS7) and quality of life data (DLQI) were only collected from those patients who completed 12 months of treatment
once the period of induction into the ongoing treatment regimen was
finished. Our series was made up of 64 patients, with 40 females and
24 males. All of them had been diagnosed with CSU.

Considering the therapeutic record prior to the prescription of
omalizumab, all the patients had undergone treatment with secondgeneration H1 antihistamines at the approved dose or four times the
approved dose.

For at least 3 months, 7.8% of the patients (n = 5) had undergone
treatment with oral sulfone at doses between 50 and 100 mg/day.
For a minimum of 3 months, 42.18% of the patients (n = 27) had
undergone treatment with cyclosporine at doses between 2.5 and
5 mg/kg/day, according to usual clinical practice.

The progression of UAS7 and DLQI scores are shown in Tables 1
and 2. Of the 62 patients who began their treatment at a 300 mg/
month dose and completed the 6 months of treatment, therapeutic
failure was defined as UAS7 > 6 and occurred in four patients (n = 4;
6.25% of the patients), for whom treatment was terminated. After this

period, the 450 mg/month dose was not increased for any of the

patients and a different treatment line was chosen. None of the
patients experienced any adverse effects that forced treatment interruption. Three patients (4.6%) experienced moderate arthralgias, and
two patients (3.13%) experienced tension headaches.

To date, the largest CSU patient series include an AWARE study,
which examined 158 CSU patients from different Scandinavian centers, and the Israeli Forum for Investigating and Treating CSU study,
which examined 280 patients. Other case series shown a reduced
number of patients (Ensina, de Lacerda, Machado, Camelo-Nunes, &
Solé, 2015; Groffik, Mitzel-Kaoukhov, Magerl, Maurer, & Staubach,
2011; Mager! et al., 2010; Thomsen et al., 2017; Vadasz et al., 2017).

Regarding our series, the rapid response experienced by half of
the patients in the series allowed us to reduce the dose during the
process control. The speed of this response seems to be related to
monomeric IgE blocking, near suppression of mast cell degranulation,
and prevention in the binding of the IgE to its receptor of high affinity
in the basophils, which manifested 1 week after the treatment began
(Chang et al., 2015; Kaplan, Giménez-Arnau, & Saini, 2017).

There are a number of limitations to our series, such as the number of patients included, the low representation of allergology departments from our region, and the difficulty in establishing a unified
stratification of patients due to the fact that patients came from
different departments.

Based on our results and the finding of previous studies, we
conclude that omalizumab is an effective second-line drug in CSU management. Due to its versatility, its posology may be modified to suit each
patient's needs to significantly improve quality of life. Additionally, it has

an excellent safety profile and few notable side effects.
