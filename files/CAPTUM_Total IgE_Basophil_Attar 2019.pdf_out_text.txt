The CD63 basophil activation test as a diagnostic
tool for assessing autoimmunity in patients with
chronic spontaneous urticaria

Background: Over the past years, it has become widely recognized
that a proportion of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) cases is of
autoimmune origin, however, the search for reliable diagnostic tools to
confirm underlying autoimmune pathophysiology is ongoing. The CD63
basophil activation test (CD63 BAT) has recently become useful for diagnosing autoimmune CSU. Objectives: To analyse the correlation between
positive CD63 BAT results, total IgE antibody levels, and the presence
of autoimmune thyroiditis as a comorbidity in patients diagnosed with
CSU. Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of
CD63 BAT results obtained from 87 CSU and 20 non-CSU patients. The
information extracted from the patients’ records included age, gender,
total IgE levels, clinical history of autoimmune thyroiditis (AT), and the
presence of anti-thyroid autoantibodies. Results: Positive CD63 BAT
results were significantly more frequent in CSU patients compared with
non-CSU subjects (p=0.045). Furthermore, we found a strong significant
negative correlation between the stimulation index (SI) value for CD63
BAT and total IgE levels in CD63 BAT-positive CSU patients (p=0.004;
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient p=-0.322), meaning that higher
SI values corresponded to lower total IgE values, and vice versa. Conclusion: The current standard set of diagnostic tools cannot be reliably
used to determine when CSU is caused by autoimmune mechanisms.
There is evidence that CD63 BAT represents a helpful diagnostic tool
for detecting underlying autoimmunity. We show that high SI values in
CD63 BAT-positive CSU patients correlate negatively with their total
IgE levels. The clinical relevance of this effect needs to be investigated
further.

Key words: chronic spontaneous urticaria, CD63 basophil activation
test, autoimmune thyroiditis, autoimmunity, autoimmune urticaria

as a spontaneous occurrence of hives and/or

angioedema for a duration of over six weeks [1].
It is often not possible to pinpoint its aetiology, however,
a proportion of CSU cases is considered to be of autoimmune nature, based on experimental and clinical evidence
[2]. Recent studies describe the presence of functional IgG
autoantibodies against IgE and the high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) in the sera of some CSU patients [3-6]. Because
of its ability to detect the presence of autoreactivity in
CSU patients, the autologous serum skin test (ASST) is
a widely used in vivo diagnostic tool, however, a positive
ASST result alone is not enough for a diagnosis of autoimmune urticaria [7]. In recent decades, in vitro assays - the
basophil histamine release assay (BHRA) and the basophil
activation test (BAT) - have also been shown to be highly
effective for detecting autoimmunity [8, 9]. Furthermore,
it has been suggested that positive results of these two in
vitro tests might not only be linked to high disease activity
in both adults and children, but may also serve as predictors for how rapidly the patient will respond to treatment
10-12].

Germany between 2007 and 2013. The data collected from
the patients’ files included such parameters as age, gender,
total IgE levels (in kU/L), clinical history of autoimmune
thyroiditis, and the presence of anti-thyroid autoantibodies
(in U/L).

The study population included 87 patients diagnosed with
CSU and 20 non-CSU patients (used as control subjects)
who underwent diagnostic evaluation at the outpatient clinic
for other, non-CSU, conditions, such as drug hypersensitivity reactions or food allergies, and received the CD63 BAT
as a part of the diagnostic procedure.

The basophil activation test

Commercially available BAT kits were purchased from
BUHLMANN LABORATORIES AG, Schonenbuch,
Switzerland (Flow Cast®). In each case, the BAT was performed on the same day when the patients’ blood samples
were collected; the sera were not frozen for storage. Prior
to the testing, the sera were heat-inactivated for 30 minutes
at 56°C in order to prevent non-specific basophil activation.
All further steps were carried out in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions: 50 wL of each patient’s serum
was mixed with 50 wL of the donor’s blood, then 100 wL of
stimulation buffer and 20 wL of staining reagent (a mixture
of monoclonal antibodies to human CD63 labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate [anti-CD63-FITC] and to human
chemokine receptor CCR3 labelled with phycoerythrin
[anti-CCR3-PE]), both from BUHLMANN LABORATORIES AG (Schénenbuch, Switzerland), were added. The
samples were incubated in a water bath for 30 minutes
at 37°C. A healthy, non-atopic volunteer (a 40-year-old
female) served as a basophil donor for the entire study. To
determine the reactivity of the donor’s basophils, positive
and negative control tests were performed. For the negative
control - the donor’s individual background - 50 wL of stimulation buffer was used instead of patient serum. For the two
positive control tests, the incubation of the basophils was
performed with highly specific monoclonal antibody to the
high-affinity IgE binding receptor (anti-FeeRI mAb) and
the non-specific cell activator, N-formyl-L-methionyl-Lleucyl-phenylalanine ((MLP); 50 wL each (both purchased
from BUHLMANN LABORATORIES AG, Schénenbuch,
Switzerland).

After this step, 2 mL of prewarmed lysing solution was
added and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature
(18-28°C) in order to remove the erythrocytes by a lysis
reaction. After centrifugation for five minutes at 500g, the
cells were resuspended in 300 wL of wash buffer and then
analysed for CD63 expression in a BD FACScan™ flow
cytometer using Flow Cast®. There were at least 500 to
600 basophilic cells acquired per sample.

Stimulation index (SI), defined as the ratio between the
percentage of degranulated donor basophils (CD63* cells)
after stimulation with a patient’s serum and the percentage
of activated basophils without stimulation (negative control), was calculated for each patient. The BAT result was
considered to be positive if the SI was >2.5.

Total IgE

The total IgE levels in the patients’ sera were measured
with the ImmunoCAP™ 250 system (Phadia, Uppsala,

EJD, vol. 29, n° 6, November-December 2019

Sweden). The results were expressed in kU/L. The total
IgE level was considered elevated if the value exceeded
100 kU/L.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (version
16.0, SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Descriptive statistics of
metric-scaled data were presented by median and interquartile range (IQR = 1° to 3" quartile). Pairwise group
comparisons were performed using the Mann-Whitney U
test. The distribution of categorical data was presented by
absolute and relative frequencies and compared between the
groups using the Chi-squared test (x7 test). Spearman’s rank
correlation was applied to analyse the association between
the variables. Statistical hypothesis testing was conducted
at 5% significance level.

Results

Epidemiological data

The median age of the 87 CSU patients (31 male and 56
female) was 41 (28-55) years. The age difference between
the male and the female CSU patients was not statistically
significant (p=0.1). The average age of the 20 non-CSU
subjects (the control group) was 53 (41-76) years. There
was also no statistically significant age difference between
the male and the female non-CSU patients (six male and 14
female subjects; p=0.13) There was no statistically significant difference in gender distribution between the CSU
and the non-CSU groups (p=0.617). However, the nonCSU subjects were significantly older compared to the CSU
patients (p<0.001).

Total IgE levels

Measurement of total IgE was performed in 80 CSU patients
and 18 control subjects (non-CSU patients). The median
total IgE level in the patients of the CSU group was 72.0
(27.5-202.5) KU/L, and 15.2 (7.9-19.3) kU/L in the control group, qualifying as a statistically significant difference
(p<0.001). In the CSU group, the male patients had significantly higher total IgE levels than the female patients
(p=0.008). There were no statistically significant genderrelated differences in total IgE levels in the control group
(p=0.289).

The basophil activation test (CD63 BAT)

The CD63 BAT was performed in all 87 patients of the CSU
group and was positive in 56 of the cases (64.4%). To investigate the clinical relevance of this finding, the CD63 BAT
was also performed in all 20 of the control subjects, with
eight positive results (40%). Compared with the control
population, the proportion of positive CD63 BAT results
was significantly higher in the CSU patients (p=0.045).
In the CD63 BAT-positive CSU patients and control subjects, the median SI was 8.9 (4.4-16.0) and 6.5 (5.3-10.5),

respectively. There was a higher variability in the SI
values of the BAT-positive CSU patients compared to CD63
BAT-positive control subjects (interquartile range: 11.6 vs
5.2) (figure 1). However, the SI values showed no statistically significant difference between the CD63 BAT-positive
individuals of the CSU and the control groups (p=0.745).
There were no significant differences in age between the
CD63 BAT-positive and CD63 BAT-negative CSU patients,
with a median age of 40 (27-55) and 42 (30-54), respectively
(p=0.670). However, a statistically significant genderrelated difference was found: 41 of the CD63 BAT-positive
patients were female and only 15 were male (p=0.021),
whereas in the CD63 BAT-negative subjects, the gender
distribution was almost equal (15 female and 16 male). The
average total IgE level in those CSU patients who had positive CD63 BAT results was 68.5 (22.8-178.0) KU/L. In the
CSU patients with negative CD63 BAT results, this was 87.7
(62.0-238.0) KU/L. Therefore, there was no statistically significant difference in total IgE levels between these two
subgroups of CSU patients (p=0.052). However, there was
a statistically significant negative correlation between the SI
values and total IgE levels in the CD63 BAT-positive CSU
subjects (p=0.004; Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient
p=-0.322), which means that higher SI values corresponded
to lower total IgE values, and vice versa (figure 2).

Autoimmune thyroiditis

Sixty-six of the 87 CSU patients were screened for clinical
history or present clinical manifestations of autoimmune
thyroiditis (AT). Of these 66 CSU patients, 37 (56.1%) had
positive CD63 BAT results. Ten CSU patients had elevated
serum levels of anti-thyroid autoantibodies: anti-thyroid
peroxidase (TPO) antibodies and/or anti-thyroglobulin
antibodies (TgAb); 13 reported a history of physiciandiagnosed autoimmune thyroiditis. A total of 15 patients
had elevated serum levels of anti-thyroid autoantibodies
and/or reported a history of AT. The mean age of these
patients was 40 (20-51) years. There was no significant
difference in age compared to the CSU patients without a

elevated serum levels of anti-thyroid autoantibodies and/or
a known history of AT, 12 (80.0%) tested positive in the
CD63 BAT. Additionally, almost a third (12/37; 32.4%) of
the CSU patients with positive CD63 BAT results had a
clinical history or presented with clinical manifestations of
AT. However, statistically, there was no correlation between
positive CD63 BAT results and a clinical diagnosis of AT
(p=0.188), possibly due to the small sample size.

Discussion

Based on experimental and clinical evidence, it is being
increasingly recognized internationally that a proportion of
CSU cases has autoimmune aetiology [2, 13]. Currently,
there is very limited evidence of an association between
CSU and IgE autoantibodies, such as IgE anti-doublestranded DNA (dsDNA) or IgE anti-thyroperoxidase (TPO)
antibodies, as only a few independent studies have shown
that serum levels of IgE autoantibodies in CSU patients
are significantly higher than in healthy controls [14-16].
Moreover, these results could not be reproduced in smaller
cohorts [17, 18]. However, there are numerous investigations suggesting that IgG anti-IgE and/or IgG anti-FceRI
autoantibodies may play an important role in the pathophysiology of CSU in some patients [3-6, 19-21].

One of the screening tools most frequently used to detect
the presence of pathogenic autoantibodies in the sera of
CSU patients is the autologous serum skin test (ASST).
It has been shown that positive ASST results occur more
frequently in CSU patients than in healthy controls or nonCSU patients [22-24]. However, the EAACI/GA(2)LEN
task force released a consensus statement that a positive ASST result alone is not sufficient for a diagnosis of
autoimmune urticaria [2, 7]. Recently, the CD63 basophil
activation test has gained prominence as a useful in vitro
diagnostic tool [2, 25-27].

In the present study we investigated CD63 BAT results
in CSU patients as a potential marker of autoimmunity.
We also looked for a possible correlation between the test
results and the patients’ age, gender, and total IgE levels.
Similar to previous investigations [23, 28], we found statistically significantly higher total IgE levels in CSU patients
compared with the non-CSU control subjects. As hypothesized previously, elevated IgE levels in patients’ sera may
contribute to the upregulation of high-affinity IgE receptor
FceRI on mast cells and basophils and, therefore, lead to
augmentation of activity and render the cells more susceptible to degranulation [29]. It has been shown that binding of
the monomeric IgE to the FceRI, even in the absence of an
antigen, enhances cell surface expression of the FceRI and
leads to cytokine production and mast cell survival [30-32].
These findings provide a rationale for anti-IgE treatment in
patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria.

Another finding, consistent with reports of other authors
9, 10, 25], is that positive CD63 BAT results are more frequent in CSU patients than in non-CSU controls. Although
in our study the non-CSU controls were not healthy subjects, but patients with other, non-CSU, conditions, there
was still a statistically significant predominance of positive
CD63 BAT results in the CSU patients (p=0.045). Based
on our investigation, the CD63 BAT was positive in 64%
patients of the CSU group, which is comparable to the 4057% rate reported in the current literature [8, 33]. There was
no Statistically significant difference either in age or total
IgE levels between the CSU patients with positive and negative CD63 BAT results. However, we found that higher SI
values corresponded to lower total IgE values in the CD63
BAT-positive CSU patients, and vice versa (p=0.004; Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient p = -0.322) (figure 2).
Current studies link lower total IgE levels to lower omalizumab treatment response in CSU patients [34-36].
However, a number of complete and partial responders to
omalizumab therapy were also found to have low total IgE
levels [34]. Therefore, total IgE level cannot be used as a
sole predictor of omalizumab efficacy in CSU patients. A
positive CD63 BAT result in CSU patients, on the other
hand, has been shown to be predictive of a more severe
course of the disease, which might also be resistant to therapy [10-12]. Recent research revealed that patients with
autoimmune CSU also have significantly lower total IgE
levels than those with non-autoimmune CSU [37]. We were
not able to reproduce the latter finding in our patient collective. However, the correlation we found might represent a
possible link between these two above-mentioned findings:
patients with a positive CD63 BAT result and a high SI and
low total IgE levels might not only be suffering from the
autoimmune type of CSU and exhibit more pronounced and
severe symptoms, but also have a lower response to omalizumab therapy. Further prospective studies are needed to
verify this hypothesis.

Another phenomenon we were able to observe was a statistically significant higher prevalence of female gender in the
CD63 BAT-positive group (p=0.021). If the assumption is
valid that a positive CD63 BAT result is a sign of an existing autoimmune condition, the gender distribution might
be explained by the fact that female gender is generally
associated with a higher incidence of autoimmune disorders
[38, 39]. It has also been observed that female patients were
significantly more likely to have clinical manifestations of
the autoimmune type of CSU [40].

 

EJD, vol. 29, n° 6, November-December 2019

A further aspect that we investigated was the connection
between CSU and autoimmune thyroiditis. It has been
shown by other researchers that CSU patients who test
positive for IgG-autoantibodies tend to have autoimmune
comorbidities, such as AT [2, 41, 42]. Of the CSU patients
in our study, 23% (15/66) had elevated serum levels of
anti-thyroid autoantibodies and/or a history of physiciandiagnosed AT, a proportion similar to those reported in
previous studies [23, 28]. Herein, we found that almost
a third (12/37, 32.4%) of the CSU patients with positive
CD63 BAT results had AT. This finding was not statistically significant in our study, presumably due to relatively
small sample size and consequent limited statistical power.
To summarize, a positive CD63 BAT result was more frequent in the CSU patient group compared with the non-CSU
controls. We have also found that the percentage of CD63
BAT-positive patients in our CSU population was similar to
that reported in other studies. A higher proportion of female
subjects in the CD63 BAT-positive group in our cohort
may suggest that female CSU patients tend to develop the
autoimmune type more frequently. Additionally, we found
that almost a third of the CSU patients with positive CD63
BAT results had AT as an autoimmune comorbidity. There
was also a statistically relevant negative correlation between
the SI values in the CD63 BAT-positive CSU patients and
their total IgE levels. We hypothesize that a combination
of high SI values for the CD63 BAT and low total IgE in
patients with autoimmune CSU might be clinically significant and possibly predictive of an unfavourable treatment
prognosis, however, this should be confirmed by further
investigations.

The limitation of our study is its retrospective design,
which resulted in some non-uniformity in the data (e.g. not
all of the CSU patients were screened for elevated antithyroid autoantibody levels in the serum). In addition, the
severity of the patients’ symptoms and their response to
treatment was not investigated. Therefore, further prospective studies with a larger number of patients are needed
to reproduce the results and to investigate the relationship
between positive CD63 BAT results, SI values, total IgE
levels, and anti-thyroid autoantibodies in CSU patients and
how these diagnostic tools can help to predict treatment
efficacy. ll
