Abstract

Aim: To contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) by identifying
its relationship with autoimmunity and cytokines using the autologous serum skin test (ASST) and peripheral blood
mononuclear cell culture (PBMC) method.

Material and methods: Interleukins (IL)-4, IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF-1), interferon (IFN)-y, IL-17A, and
IL-23 levels in cell supernatants obtained by the PBMC method were measured using ELISA. Disease activity was
assessed by determining the urticaria activity score (UAS).

Results: A total of 40 patients diagnosed with CSU participated in this study. Twenty patients had positive ASS
results, and 20 had negative results. The control group included 20 healthy volunteers. We found that the IL-23
(p = 0.01), IL-10 (p = 0.04) and IL-4 (p = 0.04) levels of the patient groups were significantly lower compared with
those of the control group. The IL-23 (p = 0.009), IL-10 (p = 0.009), IL-4 (7 = 0.001), and IL-17 (p = 0.05) levels o
the ASST(-) patient group were significantly lower compared with those of the control group. In addition, the IL-4
(p = 0.03) and IFN-y (p = 0.05) levels of the ASST(+) patient group were significantly lower compared with those o'
the control group, and the ASST(+) patients had a significantly higher UAS than the ASST(-) patients (p = 0.021).
Conclusions: These results, when considered together with current reports in the literature, indicate that immune
dysregulation occurs in the pathogenesis of CSU, causing cytokine imbalance.

 

Key words: chronic spontaneous urticaria, cytokines, autologous serum skin test.

subgroups.
Interleukin-4 plays a central role in the differentiation
of antigen-stimulated naive T cells into T helper (Th) 2
cells, which are the main sources of IL-4 [13]. Interleukin-4 also suppresses Th] cell development and directs
the switching of human B cells to IgE and IgG4 [14].
Transforming growth factor B1 is a cytokine with diverse effects on cell function, differentiation, and proliferation. It also acts as an anti-inflammatory cytokine in the
skin, mainly via the inhibition of mast cell survival and
function, suppresses the expression of both FceRI and
Ig-E on the mast cell surface, and attenuates mediator
release from mast cells [15]. Transforming growth factor B
is the amplifying cytokine in regulatory T (Treg) cells [16].
Interleukin-10, another anti-inflammatory cytokine,
exerts similar effects, such as the inhibition of FceR! exression on mast cells and the suppression of inflammatory mediator release. Interleukin-10 is mainly produced
by Treg cells [17-19].
nterferon-y is a multipotent cytokine that plays imortant roles in both the innate and adaptive immune
responses. Interleukin-4, as well as IL-10, TGF-B, and glucocorticoids, negatively regulate the production of IFN-y.
High levels of this cytokine are expressed by Th! cells,
romoting the cytotoxic activities of other cells and inducing the apoptosis of epithelial cells in the skin and
mucosa [20-22].
nterleukin-17A is another proinflammatory cytokine
that is mainly expressed by fibroblasts and Th17 cells.
ts role in neutrophil recruitment is crucial for host protection against various extracellular pathogens, such as
bacteria and fungi. It is also important in autoimmunity
and inflammation [23, 24].
nterleukin-23 is dispensable for the in vitro polarization of naive T cells into Th17 cells, which produce IL-17.
Interleukin-23 plays important roles in the functioning
and continuity of the Th17 subtype [25]. Interleukin-23
may play a critical role in driving the early inflammatory immune response to pathogens or injury by directly

Material and methods

This prospective study was approved on 07/05/2012
with decision number 2012/013 by the Ethical Board for
Clinical Research at Celal Bayar University, Faculty of
Medicine.

Written informed consent was obtained from all paients. The participants of this study were patients with
symptoms of chronic urticaria who had been treated at
he Internal Diseases Allergy Immunology Clinic at Celal
Bayar University. The patients’ medical histories were
aken, and physical examination was performed. Routine
clinical examinations related to chronic urticaria were
erformed, including the following: liver function tests;
determination of the complete blood count, erythrocyte
sedimentation rate, serum free T4, T3, and thyroid-stimuating hormone (TSH) levels and anti-thyroglobulin (antiTG) and antimicrosomal antibody (anti-TPO) levels; an
autoimmunity panel (ANA, anti-DNA, and RF); an infecion panel (HBsAg, antiHBs, antiHCV, a parasite stool test,
and complete urine analysis); a skin prick test for food
and inhalant allergens; and provocation tests for physical
urticaria (an ice test for cold urticaria or skin scratching
or dermographism). All patients had active urticaria at
he time of the study and were being treated with H1 anihistamines. Long-acting antihistamines were stopped at
7 days, and short-acting antihistamines were stopped at
3 days before blood samples were collected for the ASST,
PBMC and ELISA.

The urticaria activity score (UAS) was used for the
assessment of disease activity in all patients. It was calculated as recommended by the EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF/
WAO Guidelines [28]. The weekly UAS was estimated according to the number of wheals and pruritus intensity,
which appeared during the week before the day of blood
sampling. The patients were asked to record 24-h selfevaluation scores for 7 days, using the following scoring
scheme: no wheals = 0; < 20 wheals/24 h = 1; 20-50
wheals/24 h = 2; and > 50 wheals/24 h = 3; and pruritus
intensity: no = 0; mild = 1; moderate = 2; and severe = 3.

The weekly UAS was equal to the sum of the scores obtained on 7 consecutive days, with a minimum score of
0 and a maximum score of 42. Consequently, this score
was graded as follows: 0-14 (mild), 15-29 (moderate) or
30-42 (severe).

Autologous serum skin test

A total of 10 cc of venous blood was collected from
he patients into sterile plain tubes and left to coaguate for 30 min at room temperature. The blood was
hen centrifuged for 15 min at 500 g, and the serum was
eluted. A total of 50 ul of the serum was drawn into an
insulin injector and injected into the volar face of the
orearm intradermally. Ten microliters of histamine (Alergopharma, Germany) as a positive control and 50 pl of
hysiological saline solution as a negative control (for the
intracutaneous test; Allergopharma, Germany) were injected intradermally at 5 cm from the area that received
he autologous serum injection. After 30 min, erythema
and induration were evaluated. The widest diameter of
induration and the diameter that was perpendicular to
his diameter were measured. Erythema and induration
were graded as recommended by the EAACI/GA2LEN/
EDF/WAO Guidelines [7] as follows: grade 0: skin rash
caused by physiological saline solution that is expected
0 be light pink or skin-colored; grade 1: the formation of
ink color caused by autologous serum, whereas the area
where physiological saline solution was injected remains
skin-colored; and grade 2: the formation of a histamineike red color caused by autologous serum, whereas the
area where physiological saline solution was injected
remains skin-colored. A positive test reaction was inicated when the erythema caused by the autologous
serum was grade 2 and the diameter of induration was
.5 mm greater than that of the induration caused by the
hysiological saline solution. All ASSTs were performed
y the same researcher.

junction of the PBS and Biocoll (L-6115, Biochrom) at the
end of centrifugation were transferred into a new 15 ml
tube, to which an equal volume of PBS was added. Then,
the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm, the
pellets were washed with 1 ml of PBS, and the tube was
centrifuged at 1300 rpm for 5 min. The pellets were cultured in RPMI-1640 (BE12-167F, Lonza) medium containing 1% L-glutamine (BE17-605E, Lonza), 10% fetal bovine

serum (S-0113, Biochrom) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
(DE17-602E, Lonza). Cells (3 x 106 cells/ml) were added
to 6 wells of 24-well culture plates. Three of the wells
were used as controls, to which only culture medium
was added. Phytohemagglutinin (1%; M5030, Biochrom)
was added to the culture medium in the remaining three
wells, representing the study group. Cells in both the
control and study groups were cultured for 48 h at 37°C
and 5% CO, in air. Then, the culture media and cells were
collected for both the control and study groups and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. Supernatants from the
control and study groups were stored at —20°C until cytokine measurements. To determine cell viability, the pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of culture medium. Forty
microliters of sample was mixed with the same amount
of trypan blue, and staining and non-staining cells were
calculated. The percentages of stained cells were 1% and
0.5% for the control and study groups, respectively.

 

 

 

Cytokine measurements

The IL-4, IL-10, TGF-B1, IFN-y, IL-17 and IL-23 levels in
the cell supernatant from the PBMC were measured by
ELISA.

 

Cell culture IL-4 concentrations were assayed using an
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit from Biosource (Nivelles, Belgium) in duplicate, and the mean of
the two measurements was used as the final result. The
analytical sensitivity of IL-4 was 2 pg/ml, and the intraassay coefficients of variation were 3.0% for 47.9 pg/ml and
2.9% for 119.3 pg/ml. The interassay coefficients of variation were 3.9% for 48.8 pg/ml and 4.4% for 119.1 pg/ml.

Cell culture IL-10 concentrations were assayed using
an ELISA kit from Biosource (Nivelles, Belgium) in duplicate, and the mean of the two measurements was used
as the final result. The analytical sensitivity of IL-10 was
1 pg/ml, and the intraassay coefficients of variation were
2.9% for 57.6 pg/ml and 2.9% for 138 pg/ml. The interassay coefficients of variation were 2.9% for 55.7 pg/ml and

Cell culture IL-17A concentrations were assayed using
an ELISA kit from RayBio (Norcross, Georgia, USA) in duplicate. The mean of the two measurements was used as the
final result. The analytical sensitivity of IL-17 was 10 pg/ml,
the intraassay coefficient of variation was < 10%, and the
interassay coefficient of variation was < 12%.

Cell culture IL-23 concentrations were assayed using
an ELISA kit from Bender MedSystems (Vienna, Austria,
Europe) in duplicate. The mean of the two measurements
was used as the final result. The analytical sensitivity of
IL-23 was 10 pg/ml, and the intraassay coefficients of
variation were 3.8% for 414 pg/ml and 3.0% for 690 pg/
ml. The interassay coefficients of variation were 3.7% for
401 pg/ml and 7.3% for 675 pg/ml.

Control group

 

The control group comprised volunteers with similar ages and a similar gender distribution as the patient
group who were students and staff of the Medical School
and were not suffering from allergic complaints. These
individuals underwent the same laboratory tests as the
patients to exclude any inflammatory or autoimmune
diseases. This group included 20 subjects with negative
ASST results. A volume of 15 cc of venous blood was collected from the control group subjects to perform PBMC.

Statistical analysis

The values are expressed as the mean + standard
deviation (SD). The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 16.0 (Chicago, IL, USA) was used for
statistical analysis. To compare the total patient group
with the control group, the independent samples T test
was used. To compare the ASST(+) and ASST(-) patient
groups and the control group, the Kruskal-Wallis test was
performed. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare parameters between groups. For all tests, p-values
of less than 0.5 were considered statistically significant.

 

Results

A total of 40 patients, including 29 (72.5%) females
and 11 (27.5%) males who were diagnosed with CSU and
were being treated at the Internal Diseases Allergy Immunology Clinic, participated in the study. The mean age
of the patients was 38.2 +10.4 years (age range between
19 and 56). Twenty patients had positive ASST results,
and 20 had negative results. The control group included
10 (50%) males and 10 (50%) females with a mean age
of 36.5 +5.45 years (age range of between 18 and 58) and
a total of 20 healthy subjects. The control group subjects
had negative ASST results.

According to the UAS, the percentage of CSU patients
with mild, moderate and severe urticaria were 17.5%,
52.5% and 30.0%, respectively. Among the ASST(+) patients, 3 (15%) had mild disease, 8 (40%) had moderate
disease, and 9 (45%) had severe disease, whereas among

ent age, patient gender, UAS and cytokine level
revealed no significant relationships.

Comparison of the total patient group with the
control group without considering the ASST results revealed that the IL-23 (p = 0.01), IL-10 (1p = 0.04) and IL-4
(p = 0.01) levels in the patient group were significantly
lower.

e IL-4 level in the ASST(+) patient group was determined to be significantly higher than that of the ASST(-)
patient group (pp = 0.04).
The IL-23 (p = 0.009), IL-10 (p = 0.009), IL-4 (p = 0.001),
and IL-17 (p = 0.05) levels in the ASST(-) patient group
were significantly lower compared with those in the conrol group.
e IL-4 (p = 0.03) and IFN-y (p = 0.05) levels in the
ASST(+) patient group were significantly lower compared

The comparison of cytokine levels in the ASST(+)
patient group, the ASST(-) patient group, the total paient group and the control group and the corresponding
p-values are shown in Figure 1.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Discussion

Only a small number of studies have examined the
role of cytokines in the immunopathogenesis of CSU. In
this study, the main objective was to contribute to the
understanding of the pathogenesis of this condition by
identifying its relationships with autoimmunity, T lymphocyte subgroups and cytokines by comparing patients
suffering from CSU with healthy subjects. A secondary
objective was to obtain results that could contribute to
the development of new treatment approaches.

Initially, to differentiate patients with an autoimmune
etiology, the ASST was used rather than the basophi
secretion test, which is expensive and difficult to apply.
The ASST has a higher sensitivity and specificity, is less
expensive and is very safe compared with the basophi
istamine secretion test. The ASST is the best in vivo tes
method, and its results are the most similar to those o
he in vitro basophil histamine secretion test [7]. Addiionally, PBMCs were performed to determine the cytoines that were only secreted by T lymphocytes.

A total of 20 ASST(-) and 20 ASST(+) subjects and
40 CSU patients participated in this study, and PBMCs
were performed to determine cytokine patterns. The
L-4, IL-10, TGF-B, IFN-y, IL-17, and IL-23 levels in cell culure supernatants were measured by ELISA.

The IL-4 level of the patient group was significantly
ower than that of the control group. In addition, the IL-4
evels of both the ASST(-) and ASST(+) patient groups
were significantly lower compared with that of the control
