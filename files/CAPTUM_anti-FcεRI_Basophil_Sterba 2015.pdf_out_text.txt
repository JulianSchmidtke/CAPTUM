To the Editor

Chronic idiopathic/spontaneous urticaria (CIU/CSU), which affects ~1% of the United
States population, is defined as recurrent hives for >6 weeks (Kaplan and Greaves, 2009).
Active CIU/CSU patients uniquely display suppressed basophil FceRI-mediated histamine
release (BHR) (Saini, 2014). This is a feature that improves in disease remission (Eckman et
al., 2008; Kern and Lichtenstein, 1976; Oliver, 2014). The pathways leading to basophil
FceRI suppression in CIU/CSU are unclear. There is evidence that IgE plays a role in
urticaria. For example, injection of cold urticaria patients’ serum into a healthy subject’s
skin transfers the sensitivity to the cold stimulus (Gruber ef al., 1988). Clinical trials with
monoclonal anti-IgE (omalizumab) in subjects with CIU/CSU have shown rapid symptom
relief, which implicates IgE in the disease pathway (Gober ef al., 2008; Maurer ef al., 2013;
Saini e¢ al., 2011). Furthermore, the autoimmune theory of CIU/CSU pathogenesis proposes
that serum IgG autoantibodies specific to IgE or the IgE receptor directly activate skin mast
cells and basophils in a subset of CIU/CSU subjects (Kaplan and Greaves, 2009). In this
study, we examined the ability of active CIU/CSU patients’ serum to transfer FceRImediated BHR suppression to healthy basophils and further test the contributions of IgE,
IgG, and complement in the observed basophil mediator suppression.

Healthy adults (n=8, 25% female) had repeated blood collections using an IRB approved
protocol. CIU/CSU sera were collected as part of a longitudinal study (Baker et a/., 2008).
Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects, whether for blood or for sera.
Remission sera were collected from CIU/CSU patients with no skin symptoms or
medication use for >2 months (Baker et a/., 2008). For CIU/CSU patients using
omalizumab, sera collection occurred before and after the patient had been on therapy for |

to 4 months with marked clinical improvement (Gober ef a/., 2008). All serum samples were
stored at —20°C.

Basophils were purified from venous blood using percoll density gradients (GE Healthcare,
Sweden) that were followed by negative selection as described (Vonakis et al., 2007).
Purified basophils (>200,000 basophils/condition) were cultured overnight (37°C, 18-22
hours, 5% CO2) in IMDM media (Gibco, New York) +15% serum v/v (chosen because 15%
does not induce BHR) (Vasagar ef al., 2006). Each culture experiment utilized a single
individual’s serum (CIU/CSU or autologous). IL-3 (0.1—100 ng/ml) (R&D Systems,
Minnesota) was added for basophil survival, with no difference observed in results based on
the concentration of IL-3. Post-culture analysis of the histamine content of media
supernatants and total basophil histamine content revealed no differences between
conditions.

After culture, cells were harvested, stimulated with polyclonal goat anti-human IgE (0.01-1
ug/ml) or fMLP (10~° M) (Sigma Aldrich, Missouri) at >10,000 basophils/stimulation, and
assayed for histamine by fluorimetry (Vonakis et al., 2007). In select experiments, CIU/CSU
serum were tested as follows: 1) paired sera from patients before and after remission, 2)
serum depleted of IgE by overnight incubation with omalizumab® covalently coupled to
Sepharose-CL-4B as previously validated to achieve a 98% IgE depletion rate (Eckman et
al., 2008), 3) serum heat inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes to denature IgE and inactivate
complement (Ishizaka et al., 1986), 4) serum IgG-depleted by adsorption with
Staphylococcal Protein G Sepharose 4B-CL (Fu et al., 2007) (>93% depletion).

All statistics were performed with Prism 4.0 using the Wilcoxon signed rank test between
the two groups being compared at the same concentration of stimulant. Error bars in the
graphs indicate the standard error of the mean (SEM).

Healthy donor basophils cultured in active CIU/CSU subjects’ serum exhibited marked
suppression of FceRI-mediated BHR when compared to media (Figure 1a), or media with
autologous serum (Figure S1a). In contrast, basophils cultured in media or autologous serum
showed no significant difference in subsequent BHR (Figure S1b). Further, fMLP induced
BHR did not differ between the media vs CIU/CSU serum or autologous serum vs CIU/CSU
serum cultures (data not shown).

In remission, CIU/CSU patients show an increase in their basophil HR profile (Eckman et
al., 2008). Therefore, we compared the effect of serum culture from CIU/CSU patients
during active disease and in remission. Basophils cultured in remission serum displayed
significantly less BHR suppression than active serum culture and were similar to culture in
media alone (Figure 1b).

Given that omalizumab therapy rapidly reduces symptoms in CIU/CSU patients (Gober et
al., 2008; Maurer et al., 2013; Saini et al., 2011), we explored the role of IgE in conveying
BHR suppression. IgE depletion by immunoadsorption failed to change the degree of BHR
suppression obtained with intact serum (Figure 2a). Similarly, the use of heat-inactivated
serum, inactivating IgE and complement, also did not alter BHR suppression after culture
(Figure 2b). Serum from patients with CIU/CSU disease before and after clinical

improvement on omalizumab therapy (Figure 2c) did not differ in their capacity to transfer
BHR suppression. Likewise, basophils cultured in IgG depleted CIU/CSU serum showed
similar suppression of HR to sham-depleted serum (Figure 2d).

An unclear mechanism suppresses the FceRI pathway of blood basophils in subjects with
active CIU/CSU. We have reported altered expression of inhibitory molecules in the IgE
receptor signaling pathway (Vonakis et a/ 2007). In remission, basophil FceRI histamine
response increases towards a more normal profile (Eckman et a/., 2008). To gain insights
into factors responsible for basophil FceRI suppression, we examined the effects of culture
of healthy donor basophils with well-characterized CIU/CSU patients’ serum. We
consistently observed marked suppression of FceRI-mediated BHR in cultures using active
CIU/CSU patients’ serum, but found the serum from patients in remission had less capacity
to suppress basophil HR.

Given the putative roles of IgE in CIU/CSU in disease, IgE depletion and heat denaturation
of serum from active CIU/CSU patients was examined for its’ impact on the suppression of
donor basophil HR. Such approaches failed to alter the ability of these sera to suppress
basophil mediator release. Omalizumab therapy led to rapid symptom relief in CIU/CSU
subjects with symptom rebound when therapy was discontinued (Maurer et a/., 2013).
However, culture with CIU/CSU serum in the presence of therapeutic levels of omalizumab
also failed to impair the transfer of BHR suppression. These observations suggest that the
suppressive factor in the serum of CIU/CSU patients acts through the IgE receptor pathway,
but is not IgE. Furthermore, IgG depletion of active CIU/CSU serum also failed to alter the
transfer of mediator suppression, indicating that IgG antibodies are not directly involved in
the phenomenon.

While the nature of the serum factor responsible for suppressing BHR in CIU/CSU remains
unknown, its significance as a potential disease biomarker for CIU/CSU is apparent, but
more work is needed. The suppression factor is present in active disease, reduced as the
patient experiences natural disease remission and is independent of IgE and IgG antibodies.
Elucidation of the nature of this factor may provide insights into the pathogenesis of CIU/
CSU.

Purified basophils from healthy donors were cultured overnight in media or CIU/CSU serum
and assessed for FeeRI mediated BHR. a) CIU/CSU serum cultured basophils showed
significant BHR suppression as compared to parallel media cultured basophils (n=35).
(**p<0.0001 to matched control) b) Basophils cultured in CIU/CSU patients’ serum
obtained during active disease showed marked BHR suppression relative to culture in the
same subject’s serum during remission (n=8). No statistical differences were observed
between the levels of BHR from cells cultured in serum from CIU/CSU patients in
remission or media alone. All media versus active serum statistics were +p<0.05, while all
remission versus active serum statistics were *p<0.01.
