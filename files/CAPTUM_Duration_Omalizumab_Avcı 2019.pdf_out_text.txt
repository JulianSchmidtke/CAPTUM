Introduction: It is known that serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S) levels are low in patients with

chronic idiopathic urticaria.

Aim: In the study, the effect of the drug on the DHEA-S serum levels and its correlation with the remission and

relapse times of the disease was investigated.

Material and methods: Fifty-seven patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria who were referred to our hospital and
20 healthy volunteers were included in the study. A subcutaneous injection of 300 mg omalizumab was administered to the patient group. Drug injections at this dose were completed (6 injections in total, one per month). Relations between serum DHEA-S levels and relapse rates, treatment response and remission duration of the patients

and control group were investigated in the groups.

Results: Median DHEA-S value before treatment was 116.3 (21.5-448.7) g/dl; the median DHEA-S value measured
after 3 months was 98.4 (10.0-410.0) g/dl (p = 0.003). The median DHEA-S value before treatment was 123.1

 

(21.5-299.6) g/dl when the initial and 3-mont

DHEA-S levels of the 34 complete remission patients were compared; after 3 months the value was 100.4 (23.1-301.9) g/dl (p = 0.02

Conclusions: This is the first study to investigate the effect of omalizumrab treatment on DHEA-S levels in the treatment of chronic urticaria according to our literature review. The DHEA-S levels were found to be significantly lower
after omalizumab therapy but not related to remission and relapse times.

Key words: omalizumab, chronic idiopathic urticaria, inflammation, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate.

Introduction

Omalizumab is a monoclonal IgE antibody that is
used in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU)
resistant to conventional drugs. Patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria typically have low serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S) levels. This study investigated the effect of the drug on serum DHEA-S levels and
its correlation with the remission and relapse times of CSU.

In chronic urticaria, the mechanism of action of this
biological agent has not been fully explained [1-3]. In clinical observations and series, the efficacy and remission
times in patients were found to be variable. In the literature, studies investigating drug activity discrimination

 

 

and remission variability are scarce. In addition, there is
no single laboratory parameter that is predictive for drug
efficacy and could be used for follow-up.

It is known that serum DHEA-S levels are low in patients with CSU, which may be due to stress or other
factors in the neuroendocrine system. Because sex hormones alter during the menstrual cycle, female patients
may develop hives in response to pregnancy, menopause,
oral contraceptive use, and hormone replacement treatments [4, 5]. DHEA and DHEA-S are precursors for sex
hormones. Circulatory DHEA and DHEA-S levels are associated with anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative and immunomodulatory events [6-8]. Thus, monitoring changes

in the serum level can aid in the
of CSU.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
to investigate the effect of omalizumab treatment on
DHEA-S levels in CSU patients. Therefore, we think that
it is important to investigate the effect of omalizumab
treatment on serum DHEA-S levels in patients with CSU.

iagnosis and treatment

Aim
This study was aimed to investigate the effect of the

drug on DHEA-S serum levels and its correlation with remission and relapsing times in patients with CSU.

 

Material and methods

This study included 57 patients with CSU who were
referred to the Dermatology Department of Saglik Bilimleri University, Kayseri Training and Research Hospital,
and 28 healthy volunteers. The inclusion criteria in the
patient group were as follows: patients currently prescribed anti-histaminic, leukotriene antagonist and cyclosporine treatments but did not receive systemic steroid therapy within prior 6 months. The exclusion criteria
included endocrine and metabolic diseases, hormone
replacement therapy and the use of any drug likely to afect serum hormone levels (Figure 1). Demographic data
including age and gender as well as complaints related to
any chronic illness of the patients were recorded in both
atient and control groups. Blood samples for baseline
DHEA-S measurements were obtained between 8 and
9 a.m. after overnight fasting.

Following blood sampling, 300 mg omalizumab was
administered to the patient group via subcutaneous injection. Omalizumab injections were repeated — one injection per week for 24 weeks. One patient in the study
group left the study after the third dose; thus, the patient
was excluded from analysis, and data from 56 patients
were used in final analyses.

Patients who achieved remission following all six injections were referred as the complete remission (CR) group;
those who did not respond were referred as non-responders (NR) group, while those with partial improvement were
classified into the partial response (PR) group. The time
etween the six injections and the next urticaria episode
was defined as duration of remission in the CR group.
Patients who reported urticaria at the end of this period
were classified as relapses. The relationships between the
DHEA-S levels of patients and the relapse rates, treatment
response and remission times were also investigated.
The DHEA-S levels of healthy participants in the
control group were compared with the pre-omalizumab
DHEA-S measurements of patients with CSU. The DHEA-S
values of the patient group were also examined at baseine and 12 weeks after onset of omalizumab treatment.
However, seven patients were lost to follow-up after

3 months. This analysis was conducted on 49 patients
including 34 patients with CR, 9 patients with PR and
6 non-responders.

Statistical analysis

The Shapiro-Wilk test and histograms were used to
assess normal distribution. In the intergroup comparisons, the variables with normal distribution were assessed by using Student’s t test while those with skewed
distribution were assessed by the Mann-Whitney U test.
The Wilcoxon test was used to compare the data from
different time points within the group. The x? test was
used to compare categorical variables. Pearson’s correlation test was used to assess the correlation among continuous variables. Continuous variables were expressed
as the mean + standard deviation or median (min-max)
where appropriate. A p-value < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, US).

Results

Comparison of the age, gender and serum DHEA-S
values in patient and control groups

The mean age was 39.89 +10.79 years in 56 patients
with CSU. There were 40 female and 16 male patients in
the study group. The mean age was 35.9 +7.75 years in
the control group including 8 male and 20 female volunteers. There was no significant difference between the
control and patient groups regarding age (pp = 0.088) or
gender (p = 0.345). The median value for the complaints
was 48.0 (range: 3-300) weeks. The median baseline se

observed in 10 (25.6%) patients. The median remission
time was 18.0 (range: 8.0-28.0) weeks in these patients.
The median serum DHEA-S values were 113.2 (range:
32.0-310.3) ug/dl in patients without relapse whereas
they were 125.7 (range: 21.5-299.6) tg/dl in those who
experienced relapse but the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.723).

NR group serum DHEA-S values

 

There were 8 patients in the NR group. The median
DHEA-S value before treatment in these patients was 103
(range: 4.4-321.1) ug/dl.

Comparison of the age, sex, duration of disease
and baseline serum DHEA-S values between CR
group and the PR plus NR groups

The mean age was 39.2 +11.4 years in the CR group
while it was 41.4 +9.3 years in remaining patients (NR
plus PR) (p = 0.568). The disease duration was 48.0
(range: 3-240) weeks in the CR and 72 (range: 6-300)
weeks in the NR + PR group. There was no statistically
significant difference in terms of the disease duration between the two groups. In the PR + NR group, there was
1 (5.9%) male and 16 (94%) female patients. In the CR
group, male participants made up 38.5% (n = 15), while
females represented 61.5% (n = 24). There was a statistically significant difference between the groups (p =
0.013). The serum DHEA-S values were 125.7 (range: 21.5—
310.3) ug/dl in the CR group and 112.0 (range: 34.4-448.7)
ug/dl in the NR + PR group (p > 0.05).

 

Comparison of the DHEA-S values obtained
at baseline and 12 weeks after omalizumab
treatment between the patient and control groups

The serum DHEA-S values 12 weeks after the start
of treatment could be determined in only 49 patients.
Of 49, 34 patients were in the CR, 9 were in the PR and
6 were in the NR group. The median DHEA-S value at
baseline was 116.3 (range: 21.5-448.7) ug/dl. The median
DHEA-S value measured after 3 months was 98.4 (range:
10.0-410.0) 1g/dl. The decrease was statistically significant (p = 0.003) (Figure 3).
There was also a decrease in the DHEA-S values in
6 patients in the NR group and in 9 patients in the PR
group for whom measurements were available 12 weeks
after the start of treatment, but these values were not
statistically significant (112.0 (range: 34.4-448.7) ug/dl
and 97.2 (range: 10.0-410.0) yg/dl, p = 0.057).

There was a significant difference between DHEA-S
levels obtained at baseline and 12 weeks after treatment
in 34 patients in the CR group The median DHEA-S value
was 123.1 (range: 21.5-299.6) g/dl at baseline. After
3 months, it had decreased to 100.4 (range: 23.1-301.9)
ug/dl (p = 0.021).

The serum DHEA-S values of 9 patients with remission in the CR group, in which the last DHEA-S measurements could be performed, were found to be significantly
decreased following treatment (96.6 (range: 32.0-273.3)
ug/dl and 74.7 (range: 26.7-203.4) ug/dl, p = 0.028, respectively). There were no significant differences between the serum values of the 25 patients with relapse
in the CR group either before or after the treatment 125.7
(range: 21.5-299.6) ug/dl and 113.3 (range: 23.1-301.9)
g/dl, respectively, p = 0.183) (Table 1).

 

Correlations

No statistically significant correlation was found between the serum DHEA-S values and disease duration,
age, remission time, duration of the onset of remission or
recurrence times. There was also no statistically significant
correlation in the CR group, the PR group or the NR group.
When the CR group was considered, there was a statistically significant negative correlation between disease duration and the serum DHEA-S levels (r =—-0.377, p = 0.018).

 

Discussion

It is known that hormonal changes play a role in the
aetiology of CSU. In particular, an increase in oestrogen and progesterone levels may be closely related to
the appearance of hives [9]. DHEA and DHEA-S play an
important role in both humoral [10] and cellular [8, 11]
immunoreactivity. DHEA-S also factors into important immunological and inflammatory reactions, and variations
in serum DHEA-S concentrations have been described in
several chronic inflammatory diseases [12-14]. In particular, a DHEA-S deficiency is a persistent feature in some
autoimmune diseases and is a significant contributor to
the aetiology and/or pathophysiology of these conditions
[15, 16]. However, it is difficult to find clear evidence that
low concentrations of hormones directly contribute to
the development of some systemic diseases [17].

Low serum DHEA-S levels are more common in patients with CSU. One explanation for this correlation is
physiological distress [18]. During a chronic inflammatory
response, hormonal shifts may be impaired and the re

lease of DHEA and DHEA-S may be reduced, as opposed
to the increased cortisol levels that might be expected
[16, 17]. DHEA, the precursor of DHEA-S, has been used
successfully in the treatment of hereditary angioedema
due to its inhibition of complex activation [19].

In this study, the relationship between CSU and
DHEA-S serum levels was assessed following treatment
with omalizumab, a monoclonal IgE antibody. DHEA-S
levels in the group of CSU patients were lower than those
of healthy volunteers, which was consistent in the literature.
When 39 patients with complete remission were evaluated, the baseline DHEA-S values were higher than the
values for the whole group (125.7 (range: 21.5-310.3) ug/
dl vs. 116.7 (range: 21.5-448.7) g/dl). The median DHEA-S
value of the 8 patients with no response to treatment
was 103 (range: 34.4-321.1) ug/dl. Based upon these
results, having a higher DHEA-S level at baseline may
suggest that there is an advantage in entering remission, but there was still no statistical significance. Larger

 

 

 

 

 

 

studies will be required to determine if an expansion of
the sample size can make this relationship statistically
significant.

When all 56 patients in the study were assessed, the
omalizumab treatment significantly lowered their DHEA-S
levels, which were already low compared to the population’s baseline values. The median DHEA-S value before
treatment was 116.3 (range: 21.5-448.7) g/dl, while the
median DHEA-S value measured after 12 weeks was 98.4
(range: 10.0-410.0) g/dl. Before treatment, the median
DHEA-S value was 123.1 (range: 21.5—-299.6) ug/dl; after
3 months, it was decreased to 100.4 (range: 23.1-301.9)
ug/dl.

The DHEA-S levels of 9 patients still in remission were
statistically significantly lower than their baseline values
after 3 months. In the 25 patients who experienced a relapse, the decrease in DHEA-S values after 3 months was
not statistically significant. Their value at baseline was
125.7 (range: 21.5-299.6) ug/dl, and this value was decreased to 113.3 (range: 23.1-301.9) ug/dl after 3 months.

The median DHEA-S value at baseline for the 9 CR patients who reported no relapse and had post-treatment
DHEA-S measurements was 96.6 (range: 32.0-273.3)

ug/dl at baseline; these participants had low baseline
values compared to those who entered remission and
also those who did not respond. After treatment, the level was significantly decreased to 74.7 (range: 26.7-203.4)
ug/dl.

When we evaluated the 6 patients who did not respond to omalizumab at all and the 9 patients who responded but did not achieve complete remission as a single group at baseline, the median DHEA-S value prior to
omalizumab was 112.0 (range: 34.4-448.7) g/dl. After
3 months, the median DHEA-S value was 97.2 (range:
0.0-410.0) g/dl. Examination of all these data revealed
at the patients who entered remission started out with
igher DHEA-S values. In addition, serum DHEA-S levels
were significantly reduced by treatment with omalizumab. Interestingly, the decrease in the DHEA-S values of
atients who reported relapses was not significant.

t is not easy to interpret these results using our
current knowledge. While some prior studies have concluded that a DHEA-S deficiency sets the groundwork for
inflammatory processes [6-8, 10], others have reported
hat an increase in DHEA-S is considered protective for
chronic urticaria. This information is contradictory and
may be confusing for patients.

Although it is impossible to explain these declines,
some theories can be proposed. Inflammation is supressed by treatment with omalizumab, and steroidogenesis may also be slowed. In relapsed patients, the
ailure to suppress inflammation may be responsible for
he absence of a decrease in steroidogenesis. This theory
should be tested in future studies and proven using data.
Omalizumab has been successfully used in the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria. It is also effective for
oth autoimmune and non-autoimmune chronic urticaria
as well as physical and cholinergic urticaria [20]. Omalizumab can be used in some diseases, such as atopic
dermatitis, food allergies and asthma, where serum IgE
evels are elevated, when patients do not respond to other treatments. Omalizumab, a monoclonal IgE antibody,
demonstrates its effect by reducing free IgE levels in the
lasma. The recommended omalizumab dose in chronic
urticaria is 75-375 mg every 2 or 4 weeks based upon the
weight of the patient and also the serum IgE levels. Ferrer
et al. reported that 300 mg/month would be the most apropriate dose [21], while lvyanskiy et al. stated that the
minimum dose should be 150 mg [22]. After reviewing
49 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of disease,
Maurer et al. recently suggested that omalizumab treatment should be continued over 6 months [23]. According
‘oO many reports, omalizumab is a well-tolerated drug.
he most serious side effect is the risk of anaphylaxis,
while the biggest disadvantage is its cost.

The reasons for low serum DHEA-S levels in urticaria
remain unknown. According to some hypotheses, adrenal
gland DHEA-S production may be affected by a chronic

inflammatory response and the effects of severe stress
[16, 17]. DHEA-S is the precursor to sex hormones and is
the most common steroid hormone in serum. DHEA-S
reaches its highest level in the third decade of life, and
then serum DHEA-S levels begin to fall in reverse proportions as age increases [12, 24, 25].
Many skin diseases can occur as a
stress, including both the first onse
bation of chronic idiopathic urticaria
urticaria and a feeling of discomfort may also arise in
many stressful situations [27]. Baiardini et al. reported
that chronic urticaria can impair one’s quality of life at
very severe levels [28].
Increasing the quality of life of urticaria patients with
omalizumab and similar treatments may alter their levels of sex hormones, such as DHEA-S, by acting on the
hormonal balance. The decrease in the serum DHEA-S
vels from a mean of 125.7 (range: 21.5-299.6) ug/dl at
aseline to an average of 113.3 (range: 23.1-301.9) ug/
after the third month of omalizumab treatment was
so statistically significant. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the DHEA-S level
reduction and the duration of the chronic idiopathic urticaria remission or relapse. This statistically insignificant
outcome was not different between the participants in
the complete remission (123.1 (range: 21.5-299.6) yg/dl,
n = 34) group or the partial remission (116.3 (range: 57.9448.7) ug/dl, n = 9) group.

Conclusions

This study examined the effects of omalizumab
therapy on the serum DHEA-S levels in 56 patients with
chronic idiopathic urticaria using their remission and relapse times. We measured their serum levels before the
initial treatment and again 3 months after the treatment
began. The DHEA-S levels were significantly lower following omalizumab therapy but were not related to the
remission and relapse times. Omalizumab treatment may
also affect the levels of sex hormones.

To the best of our knowledge, this was the first
study to examine the effect of omalizumab treatment
on DHEA-S levels in chronic idiopathic urticaria patients.
Since DHEA-S is known to be associated with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, we were
expecting an elevation in serum DHEA-S levels after the
treatment, but the results obtained were just the opposite. The DHEA-S levels were found to be significantly
lower after omalizumab therapy but were not related to
patients’ remission and relapse times. This subject will
be better elucidated by further studies.
