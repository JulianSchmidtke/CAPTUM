Background

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is associated with
activation of systemic inflammatory response and coagulation/fibrinolysis [1-3].

C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) are
markers of acute phase response (APR) and underlying systemic inflammation, while D-dimer is a marker
of fibrin turnover and fibrinolysis. In general, elevated
CRP, IL-6 and D-dimer concentrations are not specific
responses, which may increase during many inflammatory diseases [4-7].

Previous studies have reported that circulating IL-6,
CRP and D-dimer were elevated in CSU patients, relating
to severity/activity of the disease [1, 8-10].

Associations between activation of coagulation and
fibrinolytic systems and the inflammatory response are
found in pathogenesis of multiple diseases [4—7], yet little
is known about the cross-talk between inflammation and
thrombotic/fibrinolytic pathways in CSU.

Given these facts, we sought to see whether there was
any correlation between the markers of the acute phase
response and coagulation/fibrinolysis in CSU. Therefore,
we measured serum concentrations of CRP, IL-6 and
D-dimer as well as their relationships in patients with
CSU and the healthy subjects.

Methods

We enrolled 58 selected patients with active CSU of
unknown causes and without any concomitant diseases, including chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU)
to obtain homogeneous group; (the median of age was
39 years, range 21-45 years; 17 males and 41 females)
and 22 matched for age, sex healthy controls, the hospital staff. The mean disease duration was 30.5 months
(range 7-62 months). All patients fulfilled the EAACI/
GA(2)LEN/EDF/WAO criteria for CSU (spontaneous
appearance of wheals/no obvious external specific trigger
daily, or almost daily for > 6 weeks) [11]. Throughout the
UAS evaluation period, none of the patients showed any
manifestations of angioedema during 4 days (i.e. before
blood tests). 47% of CSU patients had a positive history
of angioedema.

CIndUs were excluded based on the patient history and
the results of provocation testing, including FricTest®,
Temptest®, dermographometer according to recommendations [12].

The disease activity in CSU patients was measured by
the number of wheals/24 h [(0) no, (1) mild (<20), (2)
moderate (20-50), (3) (>50 wheals or large areas)], and
the patient’s assessment of itch using a four-point scale
(0) no itch, (1) mild, (2) moderate, (3) severe/intensive)]
11]. The urticaria activity score (UAS) was calculated
during 4 days, modified UAS7 as described [2]. Patients
were classified into two groups; 31 with mild CSU (0-8
joints) and, 27 with moderate-severe CSU (9—24 points).
A panel of tests was performed (wider than in everyday
ractice and recommended in the guidelines, which suggest only differential blood count and CRP and/or ESR
as basic test with no further measures but those based
on the patient history and examination) [11], to select a
omogeneous group and to exclude concomitant diseases/conditions that may lead to an increase in systemic
inflammatory response markers.

Each patient underwent detailed clinical examination; routine biochemical investigations including
hematologic, renal, thyroid and hepatic function tests;
rheumatoid factor (RF), immunoglobulins G, E, M (IgG,
IgE and IgM), serum protein electrophoresis and complement components (C3 and C4) analysis; anti-cyclic
citrullinated peptide autoantibodies (anti-CCP), allergenspecific IgE antibodies (to environmental allergens), antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-TPO, antibodies specific to
the B. burgdorferi antigens (Western Blot), anti-Ascaris
lumbricoides and anti-H. pylori antibodies, toxoplasma
and toxocariasis specific antibodies, anti-neutrophil
cytoplasmic antibodies assays; serum lipid profile; stool
ova, parasites and H. pylori antigen as well as routine
urine exam; dental and chest X-rays; abdominal and thyroid ultrasound; some other investigation depending on

medical history e.g. computed tomography (CT) of the
sinuses, gastroscopy and colonoscopy procedures; antiendomysial, anti-transglutaminase and antiphospholipid
antibodies assays.

All patients underwent stomatological, gynaecological,
and laryngological examinations. The exclusion criteria
were as follows: infectious atopic and inflammatory disease, rheumatoid or other autoimmune diseases, known
malignancy, hepatic, thyroid or renal dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, immunoglobulin
disorders and obesity.

All patients were free of second generation H1-antihistamine administration within the last 4 days, and glucocorticoids and cyclosporine therapy had been withdrawn
at least 8 weeks before. None of these patients were previously treated with omalizumab.

The Ethical Committee of the Medical University of
Silesia approved of the study protocol and written consent was obtained from CSU patients and the controls.

Blood collection

For all measurements, venous blood was collected from
the antecubital vein in the morning after an overnight
fast. Sera obtained by centrifugation were stored at
—85 °C until analysis of concentrations of CRP, IL-6 and
D-dimer. The remaining samples were collected in tubes
with different anticoagulant solutions depending on the
type of analysis and evaluations were made as part of a
standard battery of routine laboratory examinations in
CSU patients.

Assay of CRP, D-dimer and II-6

Concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer
and interleukin-6 (Il-6) in serum samples were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
using commercially available kits: Quantikine ELISA
Human C-Reactive Protein/CRP kit by R&D Systems
(MN, USA) for CRP, Human D-Dimer SimpleStep ELISA
kit ab196269 by Abcam (Cambridge, UK) for D-dimer
and Quantikine ELISA Human II-6 kit by R&D Systems
(MN, USA) for Il-6. All assays were performed according
to manufacturer’s detailed instructions. The coefficients
of variance for intra-assay and inter-assay were for all
assays below 8 and 10%, respectively.

Statistical analysis

The data were presented as the median and interquartile
range (IQR). Normal distribution of data was calculated
using Shapiro—Wilk’s test. Independent samples between
the groups of CSU patients and the controls were compared using non-parametric the WU Mann-Whitney
test. Comparisons between different groups were carried out by the ANOVA rang Kruskal-Wallis test. The
Grzanka et al. Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol (2018) 14:27

correlations (R values) were assessed using Spearman's
rank test.

The p value of less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All statistical calculations were preformed using STATISTICA for Microsoft Windows 10.0
(StatSoft Poland).

The mild CSU patients showed significantly higher concentrations of IL-6 [median and IQR: 2.86 (1.58—5.35) vs
1.0 (0.43-1.58) pg/ml; p< 0.001], CRP [4.62 (3.16-6.32)
vs 0.3 (0.21-0.65) mg/l; »<0.001] than the controls. In
mild CSU patients D-dimer concentrations did not differ
significantly as compared with the controls [median and
IQR: 783.1 (496.29-2195.62) vs 598.75 (225.15-2139.73)
ng/ml; p> 0.05; Fig. 1, 2, 3].

Correlations
Both IL-6 and CRP were positively correlated with
D-dimer (R=0.36, p=0.005 and R=0.4, p=0.002,
respectively, Figs. 4, 5.) In addition there were significant correlations between IL-6 and CRP concentrations
(R=0.38, p=0.003, Fig. 6).

There were significant correlations between UAS
and IL-6, CRP, D-dimer (R=0.4, p=0.0019; R=0.98,
p=0.00000; R=0.39, p=0.002).

Discussion

It is known, that chronic low-grade inflammation and
activation of coagulation/fibrinolytic systems are present
in CSU, especially in patients with more severe disease
activity [3, 13]. The present findings are consistent with
previous studies, indicating that CSU is characterized

by the presence of elevated circulating markers of acute
phase response (IL-6 and CRP) and of fibrin turnover
(D-dimer) [1, 8-10]. Kasperska-Zajac et al. observed significant correlation between IL-6 and CRP and the severity/activity of CSU [1, 8]. Asero et al. found that D-dimer
concentrations were higher in CSU patients, suggesting
activation of coagulation/fibrinolytic systems in patients
with more severe disease activity [9, 10]. Based on large
study it has been indicated that the assessment of CRP
may help to optimize the management of CSU patients
{14]. Kolkhir et al. reported significant association
between CRP and IL-6, D-dimer, which was confirmed
in our study [14]. In addition, we describe significant
association between IL-6 and D-dimer (p=0.005). Interestingly, a significant correlation was observed between
CRP and ERS, leukocytes in CSU [14]. We and other
found a positive correlation between these markers, likely
reflecting the potential interplay between coagulation/
fibrinolysis and acute phase response in CSU.

Therefore, we suggest that the underlying mechanism
for this higher activity of coagulation/fibrinolysis system may result from local and/or systemic inflammatory
response in CSU.

Activated local and systemic inflammation leads to an
activation of the hemostasis system, which vice versa may

modulate the immune-inflammatory response by various
mechanisms [4—7].

The key factor linking coagulation and inflammation is
the tissue factor (TF). Its expression is directly or indirectly induced by multiple proinflammatory cytokines
(IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, IL-1 [4, 5, 15] and
CRP [16], which all are increased in CSU [13, 17, 18].
It has been suggested that IL-6 may directly stimulate
coagulation in severe inflammation [19]. The recombinant human IL-6 was able to induce activation of coagulation as reflected by release of thrombin-antithrombin
III complexes and in the prothrombin activation fragment F1+2 [19]. Up-regulation of TF leads to activation
of the extrinsic coagulation pathway with subsequent
fibrinolysis and release of the cross linked fibrin degradation products, including D-dimer. These components
of the fibrin pathway may also modulate the inflammatory response [4, 5, 15]. It has been indicated that local
fibrinolysis in inflammatory lesions is associated with the
release fibrinogen-derived lymphocyte-suppressive peptides providing an immunosuppressive mechanism for
local cellular immune response [20].

Beyond the major screening role in the diagnosis
of venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism, increased D-dimer concentration was found to be

associated with a number of processes, including inflammation and infection [5-7]. Interestingly, it has been
reported that D-dimer induces the production of biologically active IL-1 beta, IL-6 from human monocytes [21].

Several markers, especially acute phase reactants, have
been suggested to provide information about the CSU
severity. In particular, IL-6, a key regulator of CRP synthesis was strongly associated with the clinical symptoms
in CSU [1, 8].

In the present study, markers of acute phase response
(IL-6 and CRP) and of fibrin turnover (D-dimer) were
associated with each other in CSU patients. These findings may relate to the association of inflammation and
fibrin turnover in urticarial lesions. It has been indicated
that CSU is characterized by activation of the extrinsic
pathway of clotting cascade, probably due to TF expression by activated eosinophils in the urticarial lesions [22,
23]. Interestingly, TF reactivity was observed in all skin
specimens from chronic urticaria patients [22, 24]. Local
inflammatory responses in the urticarial lesions appear
to promote fibrin formation and fibrinolysis, resulting in
elevated D-dimer concentration [3, 22, 24].

It seems that local fibrin formation and lysis, resulting
in production of fibrin degradation products, including

D-dimer are part of the immune-inflammatory response
in CSU and the interplay between inflammatory and
coagulation/fibrinolysis factors in CSU may lead to maintenance/amplification of urticarial inflammation.

D-dimer is a sensitive marker of fibrinolytic activity,
which may occur both, intravascularly and extravascularly. It has been indicated that there is a predominant
extravascular location of fibrin formation in urticarial
lesions [3, 24].

Considering the fact that low-grade systemic inflammatory state, with an increase in the concentration of
CRP as a marker is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases [6]. In the future, one should answer the question whether a similar situation does not occur in CSU
patients with uncontrolled symptoms accompanied by
systemic inflammatory response. Activated inflammatory and coagulation/fibrinolysis response contribute to
increased risk of cardiovascular events [6, 7]. Therefore,
it seems that CSU patients should be intensively treated
to ensure comprehensive control of their symptoms and
to reduce both processes.

Nevertheless, our study has some limitations. The study
allowed for recognition of the association, but we cannot
prove the existence of any causal relationship. It seems

important to perform repeated blood analyses after
symptomatic treatment and CSU remission. Sequential assessments of D-dimer and CRP concentrations,
related to severity/activity of CSU might provide stronger
evidence of a causal relationship between coagulation/
fibrinolysis activation and inflammation. Therefore, more
studies are required to verify such hypothesis.

A growing body of research points to the association
between these markers and the severity/activity of CSU
[14]. At present there are no better tests to evaluate CSU
patients than UAS7 and urticaria control test (UCT) [11].
Analysis of CRP and D-dimer is rapid and inexpensive,
therefore combining measurement of both CRP and
D-dimer may be a logical and practical tool to improve
monitoring of CSU activity/severity in patients with low
compliance. Dynamic measurement of CRP and D-dimer
concentrations may be clinically useful for evaluation of
the treatment effectiveness or the disease exacerbation,
especially in CSU patients with low compliance with UAS
monitoring. In addition, despite the absence of clinical
symptoms of the disease, elevated CRP and D-dimer may
suggest persisting subclinical urticarial inflammation and
indicate the need for more intensive therapy. CRP and
D-dimer concentrations decline during reduction or disappearance of CSU symptoms following anti-histamine
or omalizumab therapy and increase during exacerbation (not published observation). In addition, adequate

CRP and D-dimer interpretation is important due to the
frequent usage of the tests in the context of concurrent
infectious/inflammation or hypercoagulation processes,
which can independently occur in CSU patients. In some
CSU patients with coexisting inflammatory processes
(e.g. tonsillitis, sinusitis) CRP may be increased, but not
D-dimer (unpublished observation). Most importantly,
simultaneous measurement of both markers seems to be
more effective in differential diagnosis. Allowing for identification of some patients with individual contribution of
co-infections/inflammation or co-morbidities to variance
in CRP concentration. Taking into account the known
inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on IL-6 production,
a key factor in CRP production [25], D-dimer seems to
be better marker of CSU activity/severity in CSU patients
treated with corticosteroids due to exacerbation.

However, any recommendations and potential clinical
use should be preceded by more extensive studies.

In conclusion, markers of acute phase response (IL-6
and CRP) and of fibrin turnover (D-dimer) are related to
each other in CSU patients, suggesting the possible interaction between these markers in the disease. There may
be an interplay between inflammation and coagulation/
fibrinolysis pathways in the pathogenesis of CSU.

Clinical usefulness of these marker, especially D-dimer
for determining the severity/activity of CSU, is not completely clear.
