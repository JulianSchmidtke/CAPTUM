Abstract: /ntroduction: Activation of the coagulation cascade resulting
in thrombin production is a prominent feature of exacerbations in
chronic spontaneous urticaria (CU). Autologous serum skin test
(ASST) causes wheal-and-flare reactions in 30% to 50% of CU cases.
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and
laboratory data in patients with CU with positive and negative ASST.
To understand the role of platelets in CU, we investigated the relation
between CU clinical severity, platelet count and their mean platelet
volume (MPV). Methods: Clinical and laboratory data were prospectively collected from 373 patients with CU who attended our Allergy
and Clinical immunology Clinic during the period 2003 to 2007. The
laboratory data were compared with 46 healthy subjects. Results: There
were no significant differences in platelet counts between the groups,
nevertheless the platelets in ASST-positive CU patients were characterized by a higher MPV (9.12 + 1.25 fl), than that in ASST-negative
patients (7.95 + 1.08 fl; P = 0.039) and control group (7.72 + 1.04 fl;
P = 0.007). There was a significant positive correlation between CU
severity score and MPV in ASST-positive patients (r = 0.44; P <
0.001) but not in ASST-negative patients. Higher levels of C-reactive
protein (5.31 + 2.74 mg/L) were measured in the ASST-positive CU
group compared with the ASST-negative CU group (2.53 + 1.27; P =
0.029) and the control group (2.34 + 1.38; P = 0.003). Conclusion:
CU with positive ASST is characterized with higher clinical severity,
increased MPV and C-reactive protein.

rticaria is widely regarded as a heterogeneous group of
diseases that share a distinct skin reaction pattern, ie, the
development of urticarial skin lesions.! Physical urticarias are
grouped separately because of the special nature of their eliciting physical factors, whereas chronic urticaria (CU) is defined
as wheals arising spontaneously without any external physical
stimuli and the disease lasts >6 weeks.!
Autoimmune CU (ACU) has been implicated as a principal cause of CU, potentially explaining 30% to 50% of
previously idiopathic cases.? In ACU, the participation of

various pathogenic autoantibodies has been postulated, targeting epitopes on immunoglobulin E proteins or alternatively on
the a-chain of the high affinity FceRI receptors, ultimately
causing the release of histamine from mast cells.34

Recent findings demonstrated that activation of the coagulation cascade resulting in thrombin production® is a prominent
feature of exacerbations in CU and that intradermal injection of
autologous plasma causes wheal-and-flare reactions with a higher
frequency than autologous serum injections.° The following findings support the involvement of additional pathogenetic mechanisms in patients with CU. Moreover, severe exacerbations of CU
are associated with a strong activation of the coagulation cascade
and fibrinolysis.” Within the coagulation cascade, thrombin is a
serine protease that induces activation of platelets and may play a
key role in CU.8

Several studies indicate that platelet volume is in direct
correlation with platelet function because large platelets are
more reactive, and the presence of large platelets in blood is an
in vivo indicator of platelet activity. Large platelets are denser,
produce more thromboxane B2 per unit volume of platelet
cytoplasm? and contain more alpha and dense granules. Preferential aggregation of large platelets is observed after addition
of ADP,!° collagen and thrombin.'! They also release more
serotonin and other granule contents and express more GPIb
per unit area.!!

To understand the role of platelets in CU, we investigated the relationship between the clinical severity of CU and
the presence of a positive autologous serum skin test (ASST)
with the platelet number and the mean platelet volume (MPV).

PATIENTS AND METHODS

We retrospectively collected cases of patients referred to
the outpatient allergy clinic from Ashdod region (Israel) between January 2003 and November 2007 because of a diagnosis of CU and/or angioedema of at least 6-week duration. The
local ethics committee approved the study protocol and was in
accordance with Helsinki Guidelines.

The following data were collected:

1. Demographic data, clinical type of CU, CU severity score
(CUSS)—a semiquantitative assessment of urticarial severity calculated as the sum of the number of wheals,
angioedema, itching and pharmacologic treatment—
graded from 1 (mild) to 3 (severe) (Table 1), chest and
sinus x-ray studies.

2. Results of skin tests to common food allergens, ASST, if
done. Skin prick test was performed with a panel of 24
commonly consumed foods in Israel (using ALK-Abello
allergens)— cows milk, egg white, peanut, soybean, hazelnut, almond, sesame, pecan nut, mixed fish, tuna,
mixed shellfish, celery, wheat, tomato, beef, chicken

meat, potato, orange, pea, mushroom, apple, peach,
mango and kiwi.

3. Laboratory workup results: liver and renal function
tests, complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation
rate (ESR), stool analysis for parasite ova, thyroid
function tests, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antithyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies
(TPO-Ab), C3, C4 and total IgE.

Control Group

Control group included a consecutive series of apparently healthy individuals who were referred to the 3 primary
healthcare centers, which together serve a population of approximately 14,000 people in the Ashdod region and its surroundings. To be considered “healthy,” such individuals had to
be without a history of chronic medical disorders such as
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, autoimmune disorders, liver
diseases and malignancies and currently should not be on
medication or had not taken any medication in the last 3
months. In addition to obtaining a detailed clinical history, the
initial evaluation of these patients included a physical examination, a complete blood count, ESR, serum chemistry, ANA,
TPO-Ab, antithyroglobulin antibodies, total IgE, C3 and C4.
ASST was preformed in 46 subjects.

 

Clinical Evaluation of CU

Clinical and laboratory evaluation and classification
of CU were performed according to the EAACI/GA2LEN/
EDF guidelines.!

Large Platelets and Increased CRP in Chronic Urticaria

Cold urticaria was diagnosed by application of an ice
cube to the skin of the forearm for 20 minutes and checking for
wheal appearance within 15 minutes at the test site.

Cholinergic urticaria was diagnosed after emergence of
pruritic erythematous wheals within 5 to 15 minutes of a hot
shower.

Dermographism was assessed using firm stroking of the
skin by a dermographometer with a pressure of 4900 g/cm? and
induction of linear itchy wheals within several minutes.

Solar urticaria was confirmed by exposure to natural
sunlight.

Screening for food allergy was investigated by means of
medical history, skin tests to food allergens (ALK Abello) and
an elimination diet for 3 weeks. When drug allergy was
suspected, the relevant drug was discontinued or replaced with
a chemically unrelated drug.

ASST was performed with 50 wL of the patient’s undiluted serum after blood centrifugation, which was then injected
intradermally into the volar aspect of the forearm together with
simultaneously injected controls, including saline and 10
pg/mL histamine. The mean diameters of the wheals were
measured at 30 minutes. The test was considered to be positive
if the serum-injected site manifested a wheal with a diameter at
least 1.5 mm greater than that of the saline.

Laboratory Determinations

Blood samples were drawn from each subject by antecubital venipuncture between 08:00 and 10:00 am All analyses
were performed within a period of 2 to 3 hours after blood
collection.

Citrated blood was used with an automated blood counter
(Sysmex, Sysmex America, Inc., Mundelein, IL) for determination
of blood count and MPV.

ANA were determined by a commercially available
indirect immunofluorescence test kit (ANAFAST kits, Diasarin, Stillwater, MN) using HEp-2 cells as substrate, and titers
above 1/40 were considered positive.

Thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were
measured by a solid-phase competitive analogue sequential
chemiluminescent immunoassay (Immulite 2000, DPC, Los
Angeles, CA). The antithyroid antibody levels were measured
using immunometric enzyme immunoassay (Orgentec Diagnostika GmbH, Mainz, Germany).

Statistical Analysis

Results are presented as mean + standard deviation.
Descriptive statistics was used to describe the demographic
data and laboratory findings. Comparability of demographic
and baseline characteristics among treatment groups was assessed using y2 test, and a P value =0.05 was considered
significant. All statistical analyses were performed using the
software Statistica 6 (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK).

RESULTS

Patients With CU

During the study period, 373 patients with urticarial
diseases lasting >6 weeks were referred to our allergy clinic.
Twenty-two (5.9%) patients had physical urticaria and 14
(3.8%) patients had other urticarial disorders. In 48 (12.9%)
patients, other causative factors of urticaria were revealed. Two
hundred eighty-nine patients (77.5%) were diagnosed as having
chronic spontaneous urticaria (CU). An ASST was performed
in 171 patients with CU, and the test was positive in 78 (45.6%)
of them. The ASST-positive group was comprised 51 (65.4%)
women and 27 (34.6%) men, age 43.7 + 6.4 years, whereas the

was also no difference in the prevalence of a positive personal
history of allergic rhinitis and/or asthma between patients with
CIU (irrespective of ASST positivity) and healthy controls.

o differences between the study groups were observed
in urticarial wheal distribution on the skin surfaces. Nevertheless, baseline CUSS was higher in ASST-positive subjects with
CU (8.2 + 2.5) than in ASST-negative subjects with CU (6.8 +
1.9; P = 0.04).

The positive skin prick test to the 24 commonly consumed foods in Israel is presented in Table 3.

Laboratory Data

There were no significant differences between the studied groups in the prevalence of the positive C13-urea breath test
(Helicobacter pylori infection), serum total IgE, ESR or thyroid-stimulating hormone levels.

A lower number of circulating basophils were detected
in the blood of the ASST-positive group (0.07 + 0.09 cell/
mm*) compared with the ASST-negative (0.15 + 0.11 cell/
mm°*; P = 0.027) or the healthy control group (0.18 + 0.10
cell/mm*; P = 0.008).

Anti-TPO and antithyroglobulin antibodies were positive in 27 (34.6%) and 18 (19.3%) of patients with positive 17
(21.8%) and 13 (14%) negative ASST, respectively. In the
ASST-positive group, the incidence of ANA was significantly
higher 17 (21.8%) than that in the ASST-negative group 8
(8.6%, P = 0.035; Table 2).

Among the 22 patients with different forms of physical
urticaria, 5 (22.7%) had Anti-TPO antibodies and 2 (9.1%) had
Antithyroglobulin antibodies, without a statistically significant
difference in both ASST-positive and ASST-negative CU.

Higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP; 5.31 + 2.74
mg/L) were measured in the ASST-positive CU group compared with the ASST-negative CU group (2.53 + 1.27; P =
0.029) and the control group (2.34 + 1.38; P = 0.003).

There were no significant differences in platelet counts
between the groups; nevertheless, the platelets in the ASST

P = 0.007).

There was a significant positive correlation between
CUSS and MPV in ASST-positive patients r = 0.44; P <

Healthy Controls

We have demonstrated a relatively high prevalence of
positive ASST reactivity in 17 (35.4%) of healthy controls.
CUSS was assessed in the control group and was equal to zero
in all healthy subjects irrespective of ASST positivity. There
were no significant differences in platelet counts, MPV, thyroid
antibodies ANA and CRP levels between the subjects with and
without positive ASST (Table 4).

DISCUSSION

The main findings of our study are that patients with
chronic idiopathic urticaria with positive ASST have high CRP
levels and significantly increased mean platelets volume in
comparison with anti-ASST-negative urticaria patients.

MPV is a parameter that is routinely available in results of
complete blood counts. In the everyday clinical practice, an addition of MPV to the platelet count allows subtler disorders to be
detected and allows distinction of the cause of thrombocytopenia.'? Previous studies have documented above-average levels of
MPV among patients with acute stroke,!3 myocardial infarction,!4
atherosclerosis,'5 arterial hypertension!® and diabetes.'!7

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first report
of above-average levels of MPV in ASST-positive CU. The

observed difference in platelet size might indicate a direct role
for activated platelet mediators in urticaria or simply reflect
bone marrow stimulation induced by increased systemic inflammation. In general, changes in platelet size are determined
at thrombopoiesis.'*-!° Theoretically, the presence of larger
platelets in patients with ASST-positive CU might be a consequence of platelets’ consumption at the site of the urticarial
wheals and further compensatory thrombopoiesis. However,
there was no indication of increased platelet consumption in
our patients because platelet numbers were not reduced. Moreover, platelet aggregation at urticarial sites in CU has not been
noted in previous studies.?° On the other hand, urticarial vasculitis, in which fibrin deposition is seen, clearly involves
activated platelets?!; however, data on platelet size in a large
group of patients with urticarial vasculitis have not yet been
published.

Our study shows interesting results concerning systemic
inflammation in ACU.

CRP is considered as a sensitive marker for both acute
and chronic inflammation,?? but its role in the pathophysiology
of CU is largely unknown. In a previous study, plasma CRP
concentration was found within the normal range in patients
with CU with negative ASST.*! An increase of CRP in ACU

shown in our study supports the assumption that a systemic
inflammatory process may be involved in the pathophysiology
of the disease and that ACU is related to the spectrum of
immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.?> Increased levels of
circulating proinflammatory cytokines and immunologic dysregulation revealing a systemic inflammatory profile associated
with disturbed cytokine production by T cells were recently
found in CU.74

In allergic reactions, an increase of serum interleukin(IL)-6 is a key in promoting systemic inflammation and
increases in CRP levels.?5 Increase of IL-6 levels occurs later
than increases in blood histamine or tryptase, and it would be
speculated that the increases in CRP levels in ACU relate to
some degree of systemic mast cell and basophil activation.*°
Spontaneous urticaria lesions seem to be sustained by a characteristic inflammation pattern where neutrophils, adhesion
molecules, IL-8 and chemokine receptors in ASST-negative
CU. ASST-induced wheals in ACU seem to imply different
activities mainly represented by basophils and related molecules. Nevertheless, ASST is not an exhaustive model of the
many immunopathogenic pathways operating in the development of urticaria lesions, especially with regard to systemic
activation networks.2”7 Moreover, a multicenter consortium recently demonstrated in a large population of patients similar
frequencies for positive autologous plasma skin test and ASST
reactions, indicating that skin reactivity to autologous blood is
largely unaffected by the presence or absence of systemic
coagulation abnormalities.?*

The main limitations of our study are related to its
retrospective nature. First, recording bias is an important possible limitation. Second, it is likely that some subjects with CU
who were seen by primary care physicians were not enrolled in
the study because of time pressures or other reasons. Thus,
some selection biases, possibly toward including patients with
more severe urticaria, could have been present.

Measurements of MPV, CRP and basophils are easy to
establish and, therefore, might serve as a valuable predictor of
an increased clinical severity. Long-term prospective studies
are needed to confirm whether this also correlates with worsened clinical outcomes or a prolonged disease course in patients with CU.
