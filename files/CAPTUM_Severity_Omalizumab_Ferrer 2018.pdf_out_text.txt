Abstract

Background: Omalizumab is highly effective in controlling chronic spontaneous urticaria
(CSU) symptoms; however, patients can experience symptom return upon treatment
discontinuation. Pivotal clinical trials have identified two categories of patients who experience

symptom return: rapid and slow.

Objective: To identify potential predictors of the speed of symptom return after stopping

omalizumab treatment.

Methods: Phase III randomized controlled trial (RCT) data from ASTERIA | (n=319; 6x4-weekly
injections of omalizumab 75, 150, 300 mg or placebo; NCT01287117) and ASTERIA II (n=323;
3x4-weekly injections of omalizumab 75, 150, 300 mg or placebo; NCT01292473) were pooled
to identify predictors of symptom return after stopping omalizumab treatment (16-week
follow-up). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regularization
regression model was used to select predictive variables and relapse probability was
represented using heatmap visualizations. Model accuracy was tested using data from the
GLACIAL phase III RCT (n=336; 6x4-weekly injections of omalizumab 300 mg or placebo;

NCT0126493).

Results: Of 746 variables assessed, two were selected by the model as predictors of symptom
return: baseline UAS7 (urticaria activity score over 7 days) and early area above the curve (AAC
— determined by plotting the UAS7 scores across time points). Results suggest high baseline
UAS7 and low UAS7 AAC (slow decrease of symptoms) indicate higher probability of rapid

symptom return than low baseline UAS7 and high UAS7 AAC.

Highlight Box

1. What is already known about this topic? Omalizumab treatment can control symptoms
in a high percentage of CSU patients, but symptoms can return, either fast or slow, after
stopping treatment.

2. What does this article add to our knowledge? The results of this study suggest that it is
possible to selectively identify CSU patients who are at risk of rapid symptom return
after omalizumab treatment discontinuation.

3. How does this study impact current management guidelines? Based on our findings, a
simple digital tool could be developed and used to estimate the probability of rapid
symptom return after CSU treatment discontinuation, which could improve CSU patient

management in the clinic.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common skin disorder that occurs in 0.5-1% of the
population at any one time (1, 2). It is characterized by the reoccurrence of itchy hives,
angioedema, or both for more than 6 weeks with no external trigger (3). CSU is associated with
significant health-related quality of life (QoL) impairment and socioeconomic burden (3-10).
Epidemiologic data in chronic urticaria (CU) is scarce, but a Spanish cohort suggests that 52% of
patients will experience remission (with or without treatment) within 3 months of symptom
onset, and 80% experience it within 12 months; however, 11% still suffer from CU after 5 years
(1). Therefore, the majority of patients require effective and safe continuous pharmacological
treatment for prolonged periods (weeks, months, or years) to control the signs and symptoms

of urticaria.

Urticaria guidelines recommend that treatment should aim for complete symptom control (3).
Second generation H,-antihistamines are recommended as the first-line treatment (approved
dose) and second-line treatment (high dose; up to four times the approved dose), and achieve
control at high doses in 60% of patients (11). Third-line treatment recommends add-on therapy
with omalizumab (12, 13), ciclosporin or montelukast (3). In the absence of adequate
biomarkers to assess the complete remission of CSU episodes in patients who have achieved
complete symptom control, treatment interruption is required to assess potential remission.
Being able to predict which patients will experience rapid symptom return after treatment
discontinuation would enable healthcare providers to optimize treatment schedules and

facilitate a more informed discussion with patients on their long-term outcome expectations.

Omalizumab, a humanized anti-lgE antibody, is the only approved third-line treatment for
antihistamine-refractory CSU patients (3). The efficacy and safety of omalizumab 300 mg in
antihistamine-refractory CSU patients has been reported in three pivotal phase III randomized
controlled trials (14-16), in which 52.4-58.8% of patients achieved well-controlled urticaria (7day urticaria activity score [UAS7] < 6) and 33.7—40.0% achieved complete symptom control
(UAS7 = 0) after 12 weeks of treatment (17). Furthermore, two types of omalizumab responders
were described based on these RCTs: early responders, who achieve UAS7 ” 6 before Week 4
(i.e., after a single dose), and late responders, who require more than 3 monthly doses to
achieve UAS7” 6 (18). The early responder rates for these RCTs were 37% for ASTERIA I, 51%
for ASTERIA II, and 36% for GLACIAL (18). Baseline demographic and disease characteristics

were reported not to influence how patients responded to omalizumab treatment (19).

As expected based on CSU treatment in regular clinical practice, urticaria symptoms returned
for the majority of patients after discontinuing omalizumab treatment in the pivotal Phase Ill
clinical trials; however, the rate and severity of symptom return varied between patients
(Figure E1 in the Online Repository) (18). Until now, it was unknown whether baseline patient
characteristics or the speed of response to omalizumab treatment may be useful predictors of
rapid symptom return after omalizumab discontinuation. The objective of this post hoc analysis
was to identify potential predictors of rapid symptom relapse after stopping omalizumab
treatment. To achieve this objective we aimed to (1) define a set of early treatment or patient
characteristics that stratifies patients into two categories: rapid symptom return and slow

symptom return; and (2) assess the predictive accuracy of the selected variables.

Methods
Patient population

Patient level data from the four treatment arms of two RCTs, ASTERIA | (16) (n = 319; 6
injections of omalizumab 75, 150, 300 mg or placebo every 4 weeks; 16-week follow-up) and
ASTERIA II (14) (n = 323; 3 injections of omalizumab 75, 150, 300 mg or placebo every 4 weeks;
16-week follow-up), were pooled (training data set) to evaluate potential predictors of rapid
symptom relapse after stopping omalizumab treatment. Individual patient-level data from the
GLACIAL RCT (15) (n = 335; 6 injections of omalizumab 300 mg or placebo every 4 weeks; 16
week follow-up) were used as a validation set to test the predictive accuracy of the variables

selected using ASTERIA | and II.

All patients randomized to treatment were included in this analysis. Inclusion criteria for the
studies were similar across the three included RCTs (14-16): age 12 to 75 years (18 to 75 years
in Germany), diagnosis more than 6 months prior to study, moderate to severe CSU (UAS7
score > 16 during the 7 days before randomization), and hives and itch for more than 6
(GLACIAL) or 8 weeks (ASTERIA | and II) despite approved doses of Hi-antihistamine treatment
(ASTERIA | and II) or Ha-antihistamines, LTRAs, or both (GLACIAL). ASTERIA I, ASTERIA II, and
GLACIAL study protocols were approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee
at each center. They were conducted in accordance with US FDA regulations, the International
Conference on Harmonization E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, Declaration of Helsinki,

and any other applicable country laws.

Urticaria activity assessment

Daily disease activity was assessed using the twice-daily Urticaria Activity Score (UAS) (20),
which captures severity of itch and number of hives. UAS values are reported over 7 days
(UAS7) and range from 0 (no symptoms) to 42 (highest urticaria activity). In the current
analysis, missing values were replaced using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) and
baseline observation carried forward (BOCF; Supplementary Analysis) methods.

Definition of the predictor and outcome variables

Overall, 746 possible baseline or early treatment (up to 4 weeks) variables were identified and
tested as potential predictors of the outcome variable (i.e. rapid symptom return): UAS7 area
above the curve (UAS7 AAC) at Week 4 (calculated as quantitative measure of the speed of
response to omalizumab treatment, up to a maximum UAS7 value of 42 [Figure 1]),
angioedema, age, sex, race (7 possible predictors — White, Black, Native American / Alaskan
Native, Asian, Multiracial, Not Available, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander), weight,
duration of CSU, itch severity score, omalizumab dose, number of doses, CU index® test
(Viracor-IBT Laboratories, Inc; evaluates the ability of CSU sera to activate normal donor
basophils inducing histamine release, reflecting an autoimmune phenotype (21)), IgE levels,

UAS7 score, pre- and post-baseline medications (Table E1 in the Online Repository).

The UAS7 area under the curve (AUC) during the 16-week follow-up phase was calculated, using
the flux package for R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), as a
quantitative measure of the speed and severity of symptom return (outcome variable;

Figure 1). Patient level AUC data for placebo were plotted as a histogram, and a one149

dimensional k-means was used to obtain two separate patient strata: “slow symptom return”
and “rapid symptom return”.

The LASSO model: variable selection and analysis of predictive accuracy

Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is a regularized regression algorithm,
commonly used to select variables (i.e. baseline characteristics, demographics, etc.) that have
the strongest effects on the outcome of interest (i.e. the late AUC); the algorithm has been
previously described by Tibshirani (22). For the optimization of the LASSO model to the
ASTERIA I/II data, the glmnet package for R was used (23). The one-standard error rule (23)
penalization method was used with the LASSO method to reduce the risk of false discoveries.
The Covariance Test, previously described by Lockhart et al. (24), was used to examine the
significance of gain in predictive performance as a result of the addition of each predictor. The

covariance test statistics were calculated using the covTest package for R (24).

Data visualization

Median UAS7 AAC and AUC data were plotted individually for the placebo, omalizumab 75, 150,
and 300 mg groups (missing data were imputed using LOCF). The predictive models were then
trained on pooled data with all doses together, regardless of the response to treatment at
Week 12, using UAS7 AAC and baseline UAS7 as input variables. Heatmaps were generated
using the lattice package for R. Variables that are predictive of symptom return (according to
the LASSO regularization regression model) were used to generate heatmaps representing the
probability of rapid symptom return. Linear regression analysis was used to estimate the
probability of a patient from the GLACIAL study having rapid symptom return based on the

selected variables.

Results
ASTERIA I and ASTERIA II patient characteristics
Data from 600 patients (ASTERIA |, n = 301; and ASTERIA II, n = 299) with H,-antihistamine

refractory CSU were pooled together and used to train and optimize the model, while data
from 320 patients (GLACIAL) was used to test the predictive accuracy of the model. Overall, 57
patients were excluded from this exploratory analysis as they were missing baseline variables
(n = 32 missing baseline IgE; n = 17 missing baseline duration of CSU; n = 3; missing CU index;

and n=5 missing >1 variable).

Patients treated with omalizumab 300 mg had the highest median UAS7 AAC (4 week) and
lowest median UAS7 AUC (outcome variable; 16-week follow-up) versus the three other
treatment arms (placebo, omalizumab 75 mg, and omalizumab 150 mg), indicating earlier
response to omalizumab treatment and slower symptom return following treatment
discontinuation, respectively (Figure 2). The threshold value between “slow symptom return”
and the “rapid symptom return” strata was found to be at AUC = 289.375 using
one-dimensional k-means analysis and calculating the midpoint separating the two resulting
clusters (Figure 3).

Variables selected using the LASSO model

Using the one-standard error rule, the LASSO model identified two parameters that can jointly
estimate the probability of rapid symptom return after omalizumab treatment discontinuation:
speed of treatment response (UAS7 AAC at Week 4) and baseline UAS7 score (Table 1). Both
UAS7 AAC and baseline UAS7 (Week 0-4) were selected irrespective of whether BOCF (Figures

E2-E5 in the Online Repository) or LOCF imputation were used. The other variables analyzed

were not predictive of symptom return (angioedema, age, sex, weight, duration of CSU, itch
severity score, omalizumab dose, number of doses, CU index® test IgE levels, or pre- and postbaseline medications).

Probability and predictive accuracy of the model

UAS7 AAC and baseline UAS7, the two variables selected by the LASSO model, were used to
build a probability heatmap based on ASTERIA | and II (Figure 4). The probability heatmap
represents the probability of a patient falling into the “rapid symptom return” category given
the values of their “baseline UAS7” and “UAS7 AAC” Week 0-4. Separate probability heatmaps
were generated for the individual omalizumab doses and placebo (Figure E6 in the Online
Repository). In general, the pattern revealed that both baseline UAS7 and early UAS7 AAC are
predictors for relapse following omalizumab discontinuation; however, for placebo, the early
UAS7 AAC is more predictive of the late AUC. As the dose of omalizumab increases, the baseline

UAS7 becomes a more important predictor.

The model can be used to selectively make predictions for patients whose outcomes are more
likely to be correctly predicted, and the accuracy can vary from 0.628 at Week 0 to 0.688 at
Week 11 if no selectivity is applied, and from 0.857 at Week 1 to 0.868 at Week 11 when
selecting patients for which a correct prediction is more likely, as shown in Table 2. When the
model is refitted using UAS7 AACs spanning different numbers of weeks (Weeks 0 to 11; Table
2) the predictive accuracy of the variables increases as the number of weeks of UAS7 data
increases. These tighter prediction intervals indicate more certainty in the predictions (Figure

E5 in the Online Repository).

Three GLACIAL patients, with varying UAS7 AAC and baseline UAS7 values, were selected as
examples to test the predictive accuracy of the model (Figure 5; Patient A, Patient B, and
Patient C). Using the two variables selected by the model and the probability heatmap (Figure
4), we can predict that Patient A (baseline UAS7, 34.0; UAS7 AAC, 138.5) has a probability of
0.35 (or 35%; see example in Figure 4) of rapid symptom return, while Patient B (baseline UAS7,
33.5; UAS7 AAC, 75.0) has a probability of 0.57 (or 57%), and Patient C (baseline UAS7, 23.5;

UAS7 AAC, 154.25) has a probability of 0.19 (or 19%).

Discussion

There is a great need for markers to monitor treatment response in patients with CSU. A recent
review examining potential clinical and laboratory biomarkers of CSU (25), identified three
publications investigating predictive biomarkers of omalizumab effectiveness. These
publications reported that both basophil histamine release assay (BHRA) and ASST were
correlated with the time to symptom relief (26), while lack of basophil CD203c-upregulating
activity in the serum (27) and D-dimer plasma levels (28) were biomarkers of clinical response.
In contrast to these studies, we focused on identifying predictive markers of time to relapse

rather than clinical response.

Previously, it was shown that patient-level data from ASTERIA I/II and GLACIAL revealed
differences in individual patient response to omalizumab treatment and to the speed of
urticaria symptom return following omalizumab treatment discontinuation (18). In this
exploratory analysis, we investigated whether baseline patient characteristics or speed of
response to omalizumab treatment could predict patients who are at risk of rapid symptom

return after omalizumab treatment discontinuation.

Following subcutaneous administration, peak serum concentrations are reached after 7-8 days
and the mean terminal half-life of omalizumab is 19-22 days (29); following multiple doses,
accumulation occurs and steady-state serum concentrations are reached by 14—28 days (30). In
our analysis, the LASSO model selected two variables that are predictive of symptom return:
baseline UAS7 and UAS7 AAC (from Week 0 to Week 4). According to our analysis, patients with
lower baseline UAS7 and rapid treatment response (i.e. high UAS7 AAC) have a lower
probability of rapid symptom return and patients with high baseline UAS7 and slower initial
response to treatment (i.e. low UAS7 AAC) had a higher probability of rapid return following
treatment discontinuation. Furthermore, the speed of symptom return was independent of
other baseline characteristics assessed including, duration of CSU, angioedema, previous
treatments received, or patient demographics. Additional statistical analysis demonstrated the
predictive accuracy of the model significantly improves if the UAS7 AAC is calculated at > 7
weeks. However, in the real-world treatment of CSU the 4-week time point is likely to be more
practical and, therefore, developing a prediction tool may be more useful if it was based on 4week data. Clinically, these results are important as they suggest that physicians could predict
those CSU patients who are at high risk of rapid symptom return after treatment
discontinuation. This information could be used to counsel patients, after the first 4 weeks of
treatment, on the duration of treatment or to inform them about the risk of symptom return

following omalizumab treatment discontinuation.

Our results also support the utilization of 300 mg as the initial dose, since a faster and
prolonged effect was achieved compared with patients who received lower doses (Figure 2).

These data agree with previous publications; whereby, the proportion of patients who achieved

a sustained response through the observational period was higher with the 300 mg dose versus
lower doses (18). Although similar initial control was achieved with the 150 mg dose, an earlier

and more severe relapse was seen thereafter.

The fact that higher baseline UAS7 is associated with faster and more severe symptom return
could be explained by the mechanism by which omalizumab inhibits basophil (31-33) and mast
cell (34) activation (35, 36). Omalizumab sequesters free or FceRI receptor-bound IgE, thus
inhibiting both mast cell and basophil activation (31, 34). Omalizumab reduces surface
expression of FceRI in CSU; however, the reduction in skin mast cells is slower than that in

basophils (10 weeks vs. 1 week) (36-40).

It could also be explained in conditions where the roles of mast cells and basophils are reduced
following the involvement of endothelial cells and the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the
lesioned skin. In this situation, the effect of omalizumab would be reduced, thus making it more
difficult to provide symptom relief (41, 42). Another explanation might be due to variations in
the amounts of bound IgE or free FceRI receptors on mast cell and/or basophils, or differences
in autoantibodies or IgE isotypes targeted by omalizumab. Furthermore, although we did not
identify any parameter that could differentiate the groups, these different patterns of response
to treatment may not only be related to different patients, but may be due to different stages
of the disease among episodes within the same patient. These findings can only be confirmed
by gathering data from a large sample of patients who are retreated upon symptom recurrence

and assessing their pattern of response.

This study was limited by the use of data from a restrictive clinical trial (i.e. GLACIAL) to test the

model instead of real-world clinical data; however, we do not have sufficient real-world data to

test the model at present, but plan to do so in a future analysis. Here, we offer an innovative
approach which could be further developed for clinical practice to predict relapse following
omalizumab treatment discontinuation. This approach could facilitate personalized medicine in

the absence of validated biomarkers for CSU.

Conclusions

The results of this analysis suggest that it is possible to accurately predict patients who are at
risk of rapid symptom return after omalizumab treatment discontinuation. These results open
the possibility of developing a simple digital tool to estimate the probability of rapid symptom

return to improve CSU patient management in the clinic.

Figure 1. Example UAS7 curve during the omalizumab treatment phase (12 weeks) and follow
up phase (16 weeks) in ASTERIA II.

UAS7 area above the curve (AAC) and area under the curve (AUC) were used as quantitative
measures of the speed of response to treatment (yellow area) and speed and severity of
symptom return (outcome variable; red area), respectively. UAS7, urticaria activity score over

7 days.

Figure 2. Median UAS7 AAC and AUC in each treatment group (ASTERIA |, ASTERIA II, and

GLACIAL).

Plots of A) median UAS7 AAC (Weeks 0 to 4) and B) median UAS7 AUC (16-week follow-up
phase) for each treatment group. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. Missing data are
imputed using LOCF. AAC, area above the curve; AUC, area under the curve; LOCF, last

observation carried forward; UAS7, 7-day urticaria activity score.

Figure 3: Distribution of UAS7 AUC during the follow-up phase (outcome variable; ASTERIA |

and ASTERIA Il).

The dotted line represents the threshold selected using k-means to stratify patients; patients on
the left are stratified as having ‘slow symptom return’ and patients on the right of the line have
‘rapid symptom return’. Missing data are imputed using LOCF. AUC, area under the curve;

LOCF, last observation carried forward; UAS7, urticaria activity score over 7 days.

Lower UAS7 AAC and higher baseline UAS7 (red/pink) indicates higher probability of fast
symptom return; higher UAS7 AAC and lower baseline UAS7 (green) indicate lower probability.
E.g. Patient A (UAS7 AAC=138.5; UAS7=34.0) has 35.0% probability of fast symptom return.
Missing data were imputed using LOCF. AAC, area above the curve; LOCF, last observation

carried forward; UAS7, 7-day urticaria activity score.

Figure 5. Examples of individual UAS7 profiles of three patients with from the GLACIAL study.

Patients were treated with omalizumab 300 mg for 24 weeks. Patients A and C responded
quickly and remained in remission following treatment discontinuation (Patient A: AAC=138.5,
AUC=27.5; Patient C: AAC=154.25, AUC=0); Patient B responded slower and symptoms returned
soon after treatment discontinuation (AAC=75.0, AUC=514.0). AAC, area above the curve; AUC,

area under the curve; UAS7, 7-day urticaria activity score.
