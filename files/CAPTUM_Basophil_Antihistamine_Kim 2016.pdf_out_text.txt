Abstract: A substantial proportion of patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) are refractory to antihistamines. However,
identifying the subpopulation whose urticaria is not completely controlled by antihistamines remains difficult. The response of autologous
serum skin test (ASST), a clinical test for the detection of basophil
histamine-releasing activity upon autoantibodies or autoreactive stimulation, has been suggested as a potential predictor in the control of
urticaria. We sought to identify proteins that were differentially
expressed in the sera of patients with positive and negative ASST
results and to investigate their association with urticaria control.

Proteomics analysis was performed using sera from 3 CSU patients
with positive ASST results compared with those showing negative
ASST results. Seven upregulated and 5 downregulated proteins were
identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometry in the ASST-positive group compared with the
ASST-negative group.

Proteins that were differentially expressed according to the ASST
results in CSU patients were classified into 6 groups: apolipoproteins,
glycoproteins, modified albumin, haptoglobulin, plectin, and others.
Among these, apolipoprotein J or clusterin was validated using an
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Clusterin levels in 69 ASSTpositive patients were significantly higher than those in 69 ASSTnegative patients and in 86 healthy controls (231.2+44.0 vs
210.2 + 36.1 vs 118.7+71.9 wg/mL, P < 0.001). Furthermore, clusterin
levels differed significantly between patients with responsive and
refractory responses to antihistamine treatment within 3 months
(231.0+39.1 vs 205.1+40.4 g/mL, P<0.001). ASST results and
serum clusterin levels can predict 92.7% of CSU patients whose
urticaria would be refractory to antihistamines. Serum clusterin can
be a prognostic marker to determine the responsiveness to antihistamine
treatment in patients with CSU.

INTRODUCTION

hronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common skin

disorder that negatively affects the quality of life in most
patients; however, no specific trigger has been identified.
Previous epidemiological studies have reported that CSU has
a point prevalence of 0.1% to 1.0% in the general population.?*
However, CSU seems to be increasing, with a recent questionnaire survey reporting a prevalence of 1.8%.4

CSU displays heterogeneity in clinical phenotypes,
causes, and therapeutic responses. CSU is defined as a persistent or recurrent condition of the skin in which various
and mostly unidentified triggers lead to the degranulation
of mast cells. In addition to IgE and antigen complexes, a
variety of IgE-independent stimuli, including neuropeptides,
complements, products of infectious agents, and oxidative
stress, can activate mast cell degranulation and cytokine
production.*°

CSU is generally recognized as a nonserious disease, with
an average duration of 2 to 5 years.° However, the severity
of the disease is likely to correlate with its duration.*
Recent international guidelines on the management of CSU
recommend a stepwise treatment.'” After avoiding triggers,
symptomatic pharmacological treatment with nonsedating
antihistamines to reduce the effect of mast cell mediators is
universally applied to all CSU patients.

Angioedema, severe CSU, and antithyroid antibodies have
been identified as factors associated with a longer duration of
disease.°* A 6-month prospective observational study reported
that a positive autologous serum skin test (ASST)—a clinical
test for the detection of basophil histamine-releasing activity
upon autoantibody or autoreactive stimulation—was a potential
predictor for well-controlled CSU.° Considering that at least
one-third of CSU patients are not satisfied with antihistamines
alone, it is important for patients with CSU to relieve their
disease activity with immediate application of an optimal
treatment. However, to date, no reliable prognostic marker
for guiding the optimal treatment for CSU patients at the
appropriate time has been suggested.

This study aimed to identify proteins that are differentially
expressed in the sera between patients with positive and negative ASST results, and to validate their clinical utility for
predicting therapeutic responses to antihistamines in patients
with CSU.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects

We performed a hospital-based cross-sectional study on
138 CSU patients (101 females, 37 males; median age, 39 years;
range, 19-72 years) and 86 healthy controls (42 females;

median age, 37.5 years; range, 27-66 years). Subjects > 19
years and CSU patients having wheals and itching for at least 6
weeks were recruited. Patients with other chronic skin diseases

 

physically induced urticaria were excluded. All subjects submitted a written informed consent form at the time of their
enrollment into the present study. Normal controls (NCs) had no
previous history of inflammatory or allergic skin diseases
or urticaria.

Assessment of Urticaria Activity Scores and
Therapeutic Responses

The disease activity of CSU was sed using the UAS
within the last week of the outpatient clinic visit, yielding a total
score of 0 to 15.!° The UAS was determined by numbers,
distribution range, mean diameter, and duration of wheals and
intensity of pruritus within the last week of outpatient clinic

sits. Patients having UAS scores > 13 at enrollment were
classified as having severe CSU.

Patients were categorized based on clinical response to
antihistamines within 3 months after the enrolment as: responsive CSU was defined in patients whose urticaria symptoms
responded well to antihistamines; patients in the refractory CSU
group had persistent symptoms even with increasing antihistamines up to 4-fold.

 

  

Autologous Serum Skin Test

Antihistamines were withdrawn for more than 5 days
before collecting autologous sera. An ASST was performed
according to the EAACI/GA2LEN task force consensus
report.'' We defined a positive result when a wheal induced
by 50L of autologous serum at 30 min after injection intradermally was more than 1.5mm greater than that induced by
same volume of saline.

Serum Proteomics Analysis

To determine proteins that were differentially expressed
among 3 patients with either positive or negative ASST results,
we performed 2-dimensional electrophoresis on sera after
completion of the ASST as described previously.'*"!> The
relative abundance of the proteins was quantified in a sequential experiment from staining to analyzing densities of the
stained gels. Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)-stained gels were scanned using a GS-710 imaging
densitometer (Bio-Rad) and then analyzed with Image Master
Platinum 5 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Protein spots
that increased more than 2-fold in ASST-positive patients
compared with ASST-negative patients were selected for
mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Spots of interest were carefully excised from the gels and then digested With trypsin
(Promega, Madison, NJ) as described previously.'? To identify
the selected protein spots, matrix-assisted laser desorption/
ionization time-of-flight MS (MALDI-TOF MS) was used.
Conducting collision-induced dissociation method with atmospheric air as the collision gas, we fragmented peptide under
MS/MS mode. We operated the instrument in reflectron mode
and calibrated it using the 4800 calibration mixture (Applied

Biosystems, Foster city, CA, USA). Of course, each sample
spectrum was further calibrated by trypsin autolysis peaks.
Mascot and the Swiss-Prot and National Center for Biotechnology Information databases (http://www.matrixscience.
com) were used for matching peptide and searching protein.

 

Measurement of Clusterin in Sera From CSU
Patients and NCs

The serum levels of clusterin (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN) in patients with positive and negative ASST responses and
NCs were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total IgE
and complement component (C3 and C4) levels were measured
using ImmunoCAP (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Uppsala, Sweden) and immunoturbidometry, respectively.

 

Statistical Analysis

Data for continuous variables are shown as the median
(minimum—maximum). Prevalence rates are shown as percentages. The Mann—Whitney U test and Tukey test were used for
between-group comparisons of continuous variables. Categorical variables were compared using Fisher exact test. Spearman
tho test was applied for correlation analysis. Receiver-operating
characteristic (ROC) curves were analyzed to determine the
optimal cutoff of serum clusterin levels used to diagnose CSU
and to discriminate refractory CSU to antihistamine treatment,
and the area under the curve (AUC) with a 95% confidence
interval (CI) was computed. Logistic regression analysis was
applied to identify predictors of refractory CSU. P values < 0.05
were considered significant. All statistical analyses were
performed using SPSS for Windows version 19 (SPSS,
Chicago, IL).

 

 

 

RESULTS

Clinical Characteristics of Study Subjects

Table 1 presents the clinical characteristics of patients with
CSU and NCs. The median duration of urticaria in CSU patients
at enrollment was 6 months (range, 1.5—240 months). The
median UAS was 10 (range, 5—15). Of the 138 patients, 69
(50.0%) had a positive ASST result at enrollment. The atopy
rate was significantly increased in CSU patients compared with
that in NCs (54.8% vs 39.5%, P= 0.028).

Both complement 3 and 4 levels were significantly higher
in ASST-negative patients than in those with a positive ASST
result (129.8 vs 110.9mg/dL, P<0.001 for C3 and 31.3 vs
27.7 mg/dL, P =0.027 for C4). In addition, the percentage of
peripheral basophils (%) was significantly decreased in patients.
with a negative ASST result compared with ASST-positive
patients (0.46 vs 0.56, P=0.080). However, there was no
significant difference in age, sex, UAS, urticaria duration, or
total IgE levels between ASST-positive and -negative groups.

Results of Serum Proteomics

To investigate differential protein expression according to
ASST results, sera from 3 subjects with a positive ASST and 3
with a negative ASST were selected. More than 200 spots were
identified in the gels, of which 19 were increased and 22 were
decreased more than 2-fold after comparison of the mean
expression level in each group (data not shown). Among them,
7 upregulated (apolipoprotein E precursor, apolipoprotein

Results of Immunoassay for Clusterin
Immunoassays revealed that the median clusterin level in
69 ASST-positive patients was significantly higher than that in
69 ASST-negative patients (227.9 .g/mL vs 209.4 pg/mL,
P=0.044). The median clusterin level in the NC group
(133.2 g/mL) was significantly lower compared with ASSTpositive and-negative CSU groups (both P < 0.001) (Figure 2).
The clusterin level had a significant negative correlation with
the duration of urticaria (correlation coefficient =—0.272,

of antithyroid antibodies in the CSU group (188.1+49.2 in
patients with positive antithyroid antibodies vs 205.3 + 29.5 in
patients with negative antithyroid antibodies, P= 0.145). The
clusterin level had a significant negative correlation with C3
(correlation coefficient = —0.277, P=0.001), but not with C4
(correlation coefficient = —0.158, P =0.072).

Association Between Serum Clusterin Levels and
the Responsiveness to Antihistamines

We classified 83 (60.1%) patients into a responsive CSU
group based on whether their urticaria symptoms had been
sufficiently controlled with antihistamine treatment for
3 months. On the other hand, 55 (39.9%) patients were classified into the refractory CSU group because additional treatment,

clusterin in responsive CSU patients was significantly increased
compared to refractory CSU cases (227.6 pg/mL vs 209.4 pg/
mL, P <0.001, Figure 3).

ROC curve analysis yielded 202 g/mL of serum clusterin
as the optimal cutoff for discriminating the responsiveness to
antihistamines in CSU patients (AUC 0.759, 95% CI 0.679—
0.839, P<0.001). Using a clusterin level > 202 wg/mL as
the cutoff value, the sensitivity for detecting responsive
CSU patients was 84.3% (Table 4). However, with a relatively
low specificity, 43.6% of patients whose urticaria was
refractory to antihistamines had clusterin levels higher than
202 pg/mL.

Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that both UAS
and clusterin levels were independent and significant determinants for identifying refractory patients (odds _ ratio
[OR]= 1.335, 95% CI 1.153-1.546, P<0.001 and
OR =0.985, 95% CI 0.974-0.995, P=0.005, respectively)
(Table 4). However, age, sex, the presence of atopy, and
urticaria duration had no significant association with the responsiveness to antihistamines in CSU patients.

As the patients with refractory CSU had significantly
higher UAS, we further analyzed the diagnostic accuracy of
the combination of ASST results and serum clusterin levels for
predicting the responsiveness to antihistamines according to
urticaria severity (Table 5). Among severe CSU patients, 16
were responsive to antihistamines. Of those, 11 satisfied the
criteria combining ASST positivity and clusterin levels >
202 pg/mL. Therefore, the sensitivity and specificity of the
criteria to detect responsive patients were 68.8% and 90.9%,
respectively, in the severe CSU group. With an AUC of 0.798, it
was demonstrated to be statistically significant (P = 0.002).
Regarding nonsevere CSU patients, the criteria showed a
sensitivity of 62.3% and a specificity of 93.3% with an AUC
of 0.778 (P < 0.001). If focused on the prediction of refractoriness to antihistamines, we could identify 92.3% of refractory

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate that serum clusterin was significantly associated with the
ASST results and therapeutic response in CSU patients. CSU is
characterized by chronic, recurrent, and short-lived itchy
wheals with or without angioedema on skin lasting for at least
6 weeks, caused by no apparent triggering factor.'* Infiltrating

inflammatory cells, such as lymphocytes, neutrophils, and
eosinophils, are commonly found in the skin of CSU patients.
IgE-bound antigens, autoantibodies, stem cell factors, complement components, neuropeptides, chemokines, and cytokines
lead to activation and degranulation of mast cells.* In particular,
tissue-resident mast cells are exposed to an oxidative environment in the course of allergic and inflammatory reactions.*!°
Frossi et al'® demonstrated that oxidative stimuli could trigger
IL-4 and IL-6 production from mast cells and could potentiate
FceRI stimulation. Mast cells generate intracellular reactive
oxygen species (ROS) following the aggregation of FceRI and
these ROS act as secondary messengers in the induction of
several biological responses. Therefore, increased ROS may
play an important role in the pathogenesis of CSU, resulting in
the activation of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and
eosinophils. '7!*

Previous studies have demonstrated that clusterin has a
cytoprotective role against oxidants.'®°° Clusterin has been
reported as a multifunctional protein to prevent protein aggregation, to induce apoptosis of inflammatory cells as well as to
inhibit complement.?”?! In addition, clusterin as a sensor of
oxidative and proteotoxic stress, it is implicated in numerous
age-related diseases including neuro-degeneration, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndromes, inflammation, and cancer.” Owing to its chaperon-related property to inhibit protein
aggregation and precipitation, clusterin seems to actively arbitrate in the pathogenesis of oxidative injury.2* According to
these previous results, we can speculate that oxidative stress
would be involved in perpetuating urticaria symptoms in CSU
patients as shown in other allergic diseases. In addition, clusterin with an activity of chaperone, which inhibits stressinduced protein precipitation, and protects cells against cytotoxic agents, can prohibit inflammatory process induced by the
oxidative injury in patients with CSU. In a consistent context,
we found out that CSU patients presenting higher levels of
serum clusterin responded well to antihistamine treatment as
compared to whom with lower clusterin levels.

It has been firmly established that the major function of
clusterin is to modulate the terminal complement cascade and to
prevent cellular lysis by the membrane attack complex C5b-9."4
Regarding complements cause activation, degranulation an
chemotaxis of mast cells, their roles in the pathogenesis of CSU
were also well known. Thus, increased clusterin levels woul
lead to further inhibition of complement-mediated mast cell!
activation in CSU patients.

Similarly, we found that CSU patients with a positive
ASST result had significantly higher levels of clusterin, an
their urticaria symptoms were sufficiently responsive to antihistamines compared to ASST-negative patients.?> A study on
autoimmunue myocarditis revealed that clusterin has a protective role in the development and progression of the disease, an
that clusterin-deficient mice showed more severe disease, a
higher titer of secondary antibodies against cardiac antigens an
progression of acute inflammation to myocardial scarring. The
authors hypothesized that the role of clusterin was to facilitate
the disposal of bioactive cell debris and immune complexes.”°
Although we could not measure every type of autoantibody in
our study population, we found no significant difference
in clusterin levels according to the presence of antithryoid
(antimicrosomal and/or antithyroglobulin) antibodies.

Clusterin has been identified within mast cells in hemangioma.””?* Tan et al?* reported that only a small proportion of
mast cells express clusterin during the proliferative phase in the
development of hemangioma. However, the proportion of mast
cells positive for clusterin increases with the regression of

 

 

hemangioma.”* Despite mast cells having an angiogenic effect
by releasing histamine, tryptase, chymase, and heparin, a certain
phenotype of mast cells appears to play a major role in the
regression of hemangioma by producing IFNs, TGF-8, and
clusterin.*” Consistent with this observation, clusterin has been
considered a prominent marker of apoptotic cell loss in a variety
of diseases.7*?° In the present study, proteomics analysis
revealed increased clusterin in the sera of patients with positive
ASST results compared with ASST-negative patients. Furthermore, the higher levels of clusterin together with the lower UAS
were noted in patients responsive to antihistamine compared to
those who were refractory to antihistamine. However, further
investigation is required to determine whether mast cells
expressing clusterin in the CSU are different with respect to
disease activity or urticaria control status.

The ASST is commonly used as an in vivo test to determine auto-reactivity in CSU.*° When the combination of a
negative ASST result and a serum clusterin level < 202 wg/mL
was applied, we could predict 92.3% of patients whose urticaria
would not be controlled with antihistamine treatment.

Several markers were studied as a diagnostic and/or prognostic marker in CSU. Complement proteins including C3
and C4 as well as CRP are known to be associated with the
severity of csu.2!? D-dimer was also suggested as a biomarker for antihistamine resistant-CSU patients in a previous
study. Elevated p-dimer was observed in 18 of 23 patients
having a poor response to antihistamines.**

Although most of the studies on the relationship between
oxidative stress and autoantibodies were performed in conditions
including recurrent abortion, atherosclerosis, and autoimmune
diseases, it is assumed that oxidative stress induces autoantibodies in allergic skin disease.” A positive ASST result implies
the presence of autoantibodies or intrinsic inflammatory factors
that enable degranulation of mast cells induced by oxidative
stress, and this can explain the upregulation of clusterin in patients
responsive to histamine 1-receptor antagonist (HRA). Although
about a 3rd of CSU patients have a positivity on ASST; however,
half of the ASST-positive sera cannot release histamine from
donor basophils.? Additionally, ASST positivity was found not to
be associated with disease activity or symptom duration in CSU
patients through a recent meta-analysis.** Another study
suggested that mast cells without FceRI cross-linking promote
the proliferation and survival of mast cells, as activation of mast
cells to store and synthesize inflammatory mediators and cytokines potentiated by IgE-FceRI.*> Therefore, we cannot simply
conclude that the results of ASST implies whether the patients

Clusterin in Chronic Urticaria

 

have autoantibodies to activate spontaneously IgE-FceRI pathway. There is an increasing demand on studies to explore
potential serologic markers those are involved in mast cell
degranulation or persistent skin inflammation. We found significant differences in CRP, complement, and clusterin levels
between ASST-positive and -negative patients. In addition to
these data, as we suggested in a previous study that patients with
positive ASST may have serum factors that release histamine or
vasodilators that are controlled effectively by antihistamine
treatment, whereas patients with negative ASST may have higher
levels of inflammatory mediators that perpetuate inflammation.
This hypothesis is now supported by the observation that the
ASST-negative group with lower clusterin levels had a poor
response to antihistamine treatment.

In conclusion, serum clusterin is increased in patients with
a positive ASST result and has multiple functions in modulating
the complement system, regressing angiogenesis, and cleaning
bioactive cell debris. Therefore, serum clusterin may be a
prognostic marker to determine the responsiveness to antihistamine in patients with CSU.
