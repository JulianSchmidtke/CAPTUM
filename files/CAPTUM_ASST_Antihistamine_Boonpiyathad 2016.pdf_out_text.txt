Background: Autologous serum skin test (ASST) and autologous plasma skin test (APST) are simple methods to diagnose
autoimmune chronic urticaria. However, the association data of ASST or APST with disease severity and long-term outcome are still
unclear.

Objective: The results of ASST and APST might be used to predict urticaria symptom severity and long-term outcomes among
chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) patients.

Methods: We evaluated the prevalence of reactive ASST and APST in 128 CSU patients. The patients were characterized by 4
groups: negative, ASST positive, APST positive, and both ASST and APST positive. We observed remission rate among the CSU
patients during 2 years.
Results: Forty-four of 128 CSU patients (34%) had negative autologous skin test. The CSU patients with positive ASST, positive
APST, and both positive ASST and APST were 47 (37%), 6 (5%), and 31 (24%), respectively. No significant difference was found
between the groups according to urticaria severity score (USS) and dermatology life quality index (DLQI). Mean wheal diameter of
ASST showed positive correlation with DLQI. Also, mean wheal diameter of APST showed positive correlation with USS and DLQI.
Both the positive ASST and APST groups had a high proportion of 4-fold dose of H1-antihistamine than the positive ASST (p = 0.03)
and negative groups (p = 0.0009). The rate of remission over 2 years in the negative, positive ASST, positive APST, and both positive
ASST and APST groups were 81.1%, 62.3%, 60%, and 46.1%, respectively. The urticaria remission rate in patients in the negative
group was significantly higher compared with both positive ASST and APST groups (odds ratio, 5.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.6115.44; p = 0.006).
Conclusion: ASST and APST results could predict remission rates among patients with CSU. Our results suggested investigating
ASST and APST among CSU patients before starting treatment.

Autologous serum/plasma skin test in chronic urticaria

INTRODUCTION

Chronic urticaria is common skin disease defined as spontaneous
recurrent wheals or angioedma for at least 6 weeks. The disease is
not fatal but is associated with psychiatric morbidity and reduced
quality of life [1, 2]. At any time, 0.5% to 1% of the population suffers
from the disease and all age groups can be affected, so the peak
incidence is between 20 to 40 years old [3]. The duration of disease
is generally 1 to 5 years but may be a prolonged course more than
5 years in 14% of patients [4]. Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU)
is the most common type of chronic urticaria, 70% to 90% of all
cases [5]. More than half of CSU patients are thought to be caused
by autoimmune mechanism [6]. An IgG autoantibody specific for
the alpha subunit of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) or lowaffinity IgE receptor (FceRIl) or anti-IgE antibodies may be detected
in autoimmune chronic urticaria patients [7, 8]. That antibodies
activated mast cells and basophils in the skin to release histamines
9]. Then histamines influence urticaria symptoms such as wheal,
jare and itch in CSU patients.

The autologous serum skin test (ASST) involves an intradermal
injection of autologous serum, while the autologous plasma
skin test (APST) involves an intradermal injection of autologous
plasma. Both tests are easy to use in practice and have been used
to help diagnosis autoimmune urticaria. The in vitro basophi
histamine release test is the gold standard for the detection of
unctional autoantibodies in patients with CSU [10]. In addition,
positive autoreactivity (by means of a positive ASST or ASST)
demonstrates relevance in vivo to mast cell degranulation and
vasopermeability [10]. The serum of positive ASST and plasma of
positive APST in CSU patients contains the same autoantibodies
(anti-FceRI and anti-IgE) to induce histamine release from mast
cells and basophils. The difference between serum and plasma
involves coagulation factors. An intradermal injection of plasma
in place of serum significantly increases vascular permeability [11].

Factors to predict remission and severity of CSU are confined.
Patients with autoantibodies may have severe urticaria symptoms
more than patients without autoantibodies, but recent studies
have shown that ASST was not associated with disease severity
[12, 13]. Serum vitamin D and clustering levels are associated with
disease severity in CSU [14-16]. Moreover, serum concentrations of
interleukin (IL)-17, I-23, and tumor necrosis factor-a are associated
with CSU disease activity and ASST [17]. This study showed that
simple tests such as ASST and APST could potentially predict
2-year remission rates of patients with CSU.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Subjects

The study was a prospective observational study concerning
128 CSU adult patients. The patients were recruited and received
treatment at the Allergy Clinic, Phramongkutklao Hospital,
Bangkok, Thailand from 2012 to 2015. CSU was diagnosed
based on a history of continuous or recurrent hives more than
6 weeks. Patients with physical urticaria or urticarial vasculitis
were excluded. Patient characteristics data and basic laboratory
tests were completed at the first visit. Severity of urticaria was
measured by urticaria severity score (USS) that was included with
12 questions and 7 response options per question included in the
final questionnaire [18]. The dermatology life quality index (DLQI)
is a common test used as a quality of life measure [19]. This study
was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Royal
Thai Army Medical Department. All subjects gave their informed
consent before participating.

Urticaria stepwise treatment

CSU patients were treated following the European Academy
of Allergy and Clinical Immunology/Global Allergy and Asthma
European Network/European Dermatology Forum/World Allergy
Organization guidelines to manage urticaria [20]. The CSU
management guidelines suggest to identify and avoid certain
stimulus, for example, drugs, physical stimuli, infectious agents
and food allergy triggers [21]. The main option in treatment
was at symptomatic relief to reduce the effect of histamines.
Thus, continuous treatment with H1-antihistamines is the firstline drug in the treatment of CSU. The new generation of H1antihistamines is safe and without side effects to the central
nervous system function. The second-line drug is the up-dosing
of H1-antihistamines to 4 fold above the recommended doses
and suggesting for those patients with CSU not responding to a
single dose [22]. However, some patients not responding to the
4-fold dose of H1-antihistamine (histamines refractory patients)
need treatment with a third-line drug (ciclosporin A, montelukast,
omalizumab, hydroxycholoquine, and dapsone). A short course
of oral prednisolone is used to treat patients with severe urticaria
symptoms that induces remission in nearly 50% of patients
with CSU [23]. Remission in the study is defined as no urticaria
symptoms for at least 4 weeks without medication.

Skin tests

Patients were treated with antihistamine drugs and then
stopped for at least 5 days. All patients underwent intradermal
testing with 0.05 mL of autologous serum (ASST), heparin
anticoagulated autologous plasma (APST) and saline as negative
control. The serum was prepared by collecting whole blood in a
covered test tube and then allowing the blood to clot by leaving
it undisturbed at room temperature for 15 minutes. Afterwards,
the test tube is centrifuged at 1,250 g for 10 minutes and the
resulting supernatant becomes the designated serum. To prepare
plasma, cells are removed from plasma by centrifugation for
10 minutes at 1,250 g using a refrigerated centrifuge and the
resulting supernatant is designated plasma. Both serum and
plasma intradermal tests were performed according to guidelines
and read after 30 minutes intradermal injection [20]. A positive
result was defined as the appearance of a serum or plasma
induced wheal 1.5 mm thick or more than the saline-induced
response at 30 minutes. If the patients had a positive autologous
skin test, the longest and the shortest diameters of the wheal
were measured and calculated as the mean wheal diameter. Skin
prick tests (SPTs) were performed with 28 standard aeroallergens
including house dust mite (HDM), Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus
and Dermatophagoides farina and 20 standard common food
allergens (Greer, Le Noir, NC and Alk-abello, Round Rock, TX, USA).
Negative control was performed using 50% glycerine while 10
mg/mL of histamine solution was used for the positive control.

SPTs were positive when the size of the wheal was more than 3
mm in diameter and larger than the negative control.

Statistics

In evaluating the clinical characteristics of patients, data were
analyzed by analysis of variance, Fisher exact test and chi-square
test. Data for continuous variables are shown as mean + standard
deviation. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare USS
and DLQI scores between the groups. Correlation between ASST
and APST with characteristics, laboratory and USS and DLQI were
assessed by Spearman rank test. All analyses were performed
using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). A
p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant with
confidence interval (Cl) of 95%.

RESULTS

Subjects

The patient characteristics of negative, positive ASST, positive
APST, and both positive ASST and APST are shown in Table 1.
One hundred and twenty-eight adult patients (43 male and 85
female patients) were enrolled in the study and females revealed
a significant difference between the groups (p = 0.02). Mean
age was 34.8 + 10.9 years old and mean duration of disease was
25.5 + 21.3 weeks. Seven urticaria patients had angioedema

and 8 patients had comorbid disease with allergic rhinitis (AR).
Mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 22.6 + 10.4
minutes. Fifty-seven patients (44.5%) had positive antinuclear
antibodies (ANA, > 1:80). Forty-six patients with positive
thyroid autoantibody (positive antithyroglobulin or antithyroid
peroxidase antibody) were observed. Eighty-one patients (63.2%)
and 24 patients (18.7%) presented positive SPT HDM and positive
SPT food allergens. No significant difference was found between
the groups in age, urticaria duration, angiodedema, comorbid
disease with AR, ESR, positive ANA, positive thyroid autoantibody,
positive SPT HDM, and positive SPT food allergens.

A total of 84 patients (65.6%) had a positive reaction in the
autologous skin test. Of 47 patients (37%), 6 patients (5%) and 31
patients (24%) had positive ASST, positive APST, and both positive
ASST and APST, respectively (Fig. 1A). The positive ASST was 79 of
124 (63.7%) and the positive APST was 37 of 124 (29.8%). The odds
of females having a positive ASST was significantly more than
males (odds ratio [OR], 3.64; 95% Cl, 1.47-8.97; p = 0.005) (Table 2).

In addition, positive SPT HDM tended to be an increased positive

reached (Table 2).

Assessment of uricaria severity and quality of life

Positive ASST and APST at baseline revealed no difference in
urticaria severity and quality of life among patients with CSU. No
significant differences were observed between the groups with
mean USS (Fig. 1B) and DLQI scores (Fig. 1C). In the study, we
showed a positive significant correlation between USS and DLQI
(r= 0.84, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2A). The investigation reactions to ASST
and APST association with USS and DLQI were observed. Mean
wheal diameter of positive ASST correlated with USS (r = 0.24,
p = 0.02) (Fig. 2B), with no significant association with DLQI (Fig.
20). Furthermore, the size of the wheal in positive APST patients
correlated with USS (r= 0.57, p = 0.0002) (Fig. 2D) and DLO! (r= 0.57,
p = 0.0002) (Fig. 2E).

Prognosis of CSU

We analyzed after conducting the prospective study 4 weeks.
Fifty-four patients of 128 (42.2%) received a 4-fold dose of H1antihistamine (second-line drug) to control urticaria symptoms.
Also, the proportion of patients refractory to a 4-fold dose of
H1-antihistamine was significantly higher in the both positive
ASST and APST groups than in the positive ASST (p = 0.03) and
negative groups (p = 0.0009) (Fig. 3A). Approximately one quarter
of the patients were treated with short-course oral prednisolone.
Thus, no significant differences were observed regarding taking
short-course oral prednisolone between the groups (Fig. 3B).

Among a total of 128 patients, 107 (83.5%) completed 2
years observational study. During the 2 years, 58 patients took
a third-line drug (montelukast 40.4%, ciclosporin A 26.9%,
hydroxycholoquine 19.2%, and dapsone 13.5%). However, the rate
of third-line drug treatment presented no significant difference

between the groups (Fig. 3C). Our results showed 69 patients
(64.4%) achieved remission over 2 years. The patients in the
negative group had complete remission 62.1% at the first year and
81.1% at the second year. In addition, the rate of remission during
2 years in the positive ASST, positive APST, and both positive ASST
and APST groups were 62.3%, 60%, and 46.1%, respectively (Fig.
3D). The urticaria remission rate in patients in the negative group
was 5 times significantly higher compared with both positive
ASST and APST groups (OR, 5.0; 95% Cl, 1.61-15.44; p = 0.006).
However, no significant difference was observed between the
negative and positive ASST groups or the positive APST group.

Predictor for urticaria remission

The predictors of urticaria remission were analyzed (Table 3).
Negative ASST was a significant determinant of urticaria remission
(OR, 3.97; 95% Cl, 1.47-9.43; p = 0.001). Furthermore, negative APST

had the chance to achieve remission more than positive APST
(OR, 2.61; 95% Cl, 1.11-6.19; p = 0.04). Moreover, baseline negative
ASST and APST was 4.5 times as likely as positive autologous to
be in remission. Mean wheal diameter of positive ASST <15 mm
had odds of 3.44 to achieve remission more than wheal >15 mm.
In addition, patients with negative SPT HDM achieved urticaria
remission 1.46 times positive SPT HDM.

Next, we analyzed urticaria remission time associated with
urticaria severity and autologous skin test. No correlation was
observed between urticaria remission time with baseline DLQI
(Fig. 4A) and USS scores (Fig. 4B). We found a positive correlation
between mean wheal diameter of positive ASST and urticaria
remission time (r= 0.39, p = 0.01) (Fig. 4C). Moreover, a large mean
wheal diameter of positive APST showed prolonged urticaria
remission time (r = 0.55, p = 0.03) (Fig. 4D).

DISCUSSION

We reported a high rate of positive ASST among patients with
CSU. On the other hand, the rate of positive APST in our study
was lower compared with other studies. The prevalence of
positive ASST and positive APST among CSU patients was 25%
to 66% and 45% to 85%, respectively [24-30]. The prevalence of
positive autologous skin test varied depending on the country
and the defined term of positive ASST and APST. The multicenter
study by Metz et al. [31] reported that the rate of positive APST
was 43%, using sodium citrate, an effective anticoagulant. Heparin
was used as an anticoagulant in our study. Although heparin may
block degranulation of mast cells and basophils in vivo and in vitro
studies, it could explain the low positive APST result in our study
[32-34]. Coagulation activation related to pathophysiology of
CSU. Prothrombin fragment 142, D-dimer and Greactive protein

of CSU patients were higher than the healthy control group
[35]. Furthermore, after the disease remission, patients with CSU
had a significantly reduced plasma prothrombin fragment 142
and D-dimer [35]. Plasma soluble CD40 concentration increased
in patients with CSU with positive ASST that may indicate
CD40/CD4O0L interaction plays a role in immune activation in
autoimmune urticaria. From this study, we could not conclude
that ASST is a better test than APST to diagnose autoimmune
urticaria.

The study showed urticaria disease severity between the result
of negative and positive autologous skin revealed no significant
difference. However, positive autologous skin test correlated with
disease severity. The studies by Sabroe et al. [12, 26] reported that
patients with autoantibodies had more severity than patients
without autoantibodies according to urticaria disease severity.
In addition, recent studies reported positive and negative ASST
showed no significant difference in accordance with laboratory
and urticaria disease severity [13, 28, 36]. Our result in this study
was similar to the study by Kocattirk et al. [37] reporting no
significant difference between positive ASST/negative APST and
positive APST/negative ASST patients regarding disease duration,
urticaria activity scores and DLQI scores.

According to the result of this study, we suggested testing
ASST and APST together to predict long-term remission. Also, the
negative result of ASST and APST served as a good predictor to
achieve urticaria remission in 2 years. Positive ASST and APST in
CSU patients could be used to estimate the duration and severity
of CSU [25]. Furthermore, Toubi et al. [4] showed patients with
CSU and angioedema were associated with disease duration and
CSU duration was associated with the presence of both ASST
and antithyroid antibodies. Moreover, Ye et al. [38] reported the
proportion of CSU patients that achieved remission or a good
evel of control was 39% for the 6 months of stepwise treatment.
n addition, positive ASST was a significant predictor of CSU
control (OR, 6.10; p = 0.01) [38]. Positive ASST and APST results
among patients with CSU may indicate difficult treatment and
prolonged disease duration.

Concerning the study, we found a high rate of CSU patients
had sensitivity to HDM. However, our positive SPT HDM data
could not show significant differences between groups. HDM
sensitivity was possibly associated with chronic urticaria [39].
Recent studies showed 25% to 58% of CSU patients had positive
SPTs and specific IgE antibodies against HDM [40-42]. Patients
with positive ASST and/or positive SPTs to HDM had more disease

activity compared with patients with negative ASST or negative
SPT [40]. Moreover, food hypersensitivity is a common cause of
acute urticaria. However, CSU induced by food allergy was found
in only 2.8% of patients [43]. HDM sensitivity may be related to
urticaria symptoms and remission rate, but is unrelated to ASST
and APST.

Limitations of the study included the low number of patients
in the only positive APST group, making it difficult to show
statistical significance. Further study should be done with large
sample size and prolong duration observation. We were limited
to treating the third-line drug, especially omalizumab among
patients with CSU because the cost of omalizumab is expensive.
However, ciclosporin A and hydroxycholoquine were effective
third-line medications used in this study.

In conclusion, the study found a high rate of positive ASST
among patients with CSU and autoimmunity related to disease
duration. At baseline, no significant difference was
regarding baseline disease severity and quality of life between
the patients with negative and positive autologous test. However,
the negative result of ASST and APST before treatment was a
predictor of good prognosis treatment and urticaria remission
during the 2-year observational study. Furthermore, HDM allergy
was at a high incidence rate among CSU patients but without
significant influence regarding disease remission. We recommend
investigating ASST and APST among CSU patients.
