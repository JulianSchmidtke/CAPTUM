New insights into the utility of omalizumab

Abstract

Cells that express FceRIa, including mast cells, basophils, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells
(pDCs), are regulated by IgE binding to FceeRIa. Omalizumab binds IgE and prevents its
engagement with FceRla, thereby downregulating its expression and modulating cell function.
Because these cells are implicated in the pathobiology of many allergic and immunologic diseases,
as well as host defense mechanisms, it is unsurprising that omalizumab studies continue yielding
biologic insights and treatment break-throughs for many diseases. Several recent updates in the
biology and use of omalizumab will be presented here, and others will be summarized in Table I,
highlighting available biomarker-based personalized approaches.

ANTIVIRAL EFFECTS

One exciting contribution from recent studies on omalizumab has been the demonstration
that omalizumab can ameliorate the inadequate antiviral response observed in patients with
allergic asthma. Children with severe asthma are more susceptible to virus-induced asthma
exacerbations, particularly those with higher serum IgE levels.! This relationship has been
postulated to be due to impaired interferon responses to viruses in patients with allergic
asthma based on cell-based studies using peripheral blood—derived pDCs coincubated with
viruses. Furthermore, these studies demonstrated a counterregulatory mechanism between
FceRIa and Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7; an important receptor for sensing viruses and
mounting innate immune responses), whereby their protein expression is inversely
proportional.34

These observations have now been expanded by 2 recent studies using biospecimens and
data from the Preventative Omalizumab or Step-up Therapy for Severe Fall Exacerbations
(PROSE) study, which examined whether preventive administration of omalizumab could
dampen the seasonal increase in asthma exacerbations seen in children. First, these studies

revealed that omalizumab decreased the duration of human rhinovirus (HRV) infections,
viral shedding, and risk of HRV-related illnesses compared with guideline-driven care alone.
6 Second, omalizumab attenuated pDC FceRIa protein expression while simultaneously
augmenting pDC IFN-a responses to HRV and influenza virus.’ Together, these findings
provide direct evidence that blocking IgE decreases susceptibility to respiratory viral
illnesses through enhanced IFN-a responses in pDCs (Fig 1).>~7 These findings can provide
a mechanistic explanation to the results from the Inner-City Anti-[gE Therapy for Asthma
study, in which omalizumab inhibited seasonal increases in asthma exacerbations thought to
be caused by viral infections.®

In contrast, a recent study showed that mepolizumab administration (which blocks IL-5, the
main driver of eosinophilic inflammation) did not abrogate lung function decreases
provoked by HRV challenge in participants with mild asthma.? This suggests that
enhancement of the antiviral response is specific to blocking IgE and not cytokines
important in eosinophilic inflammation. Still, these recent studies raise new questions on
allergy-antiviral immunity interactions and the counterregulatory relationship between
FceRIa and TLR7. Unexpectedly, omalizumab decreased TLR7 protein expression,’
increases of which were presumed to be one mechanism that promoted greater IFN-a
production. Whether type | interferons other than IFN-a (eg, IFN-B1) or IFN-y (also
deficient in patients with allergic asthma) are also upregulated and responsible for the
enhanced viral clearance observed with omalizumab treatment remains unknown. Future
omalizumab studies might identify intermediaries downstream of FceRIa that could be
targeted to further improve or restore interferon responses in patients vulnerable to viral
respiratory tract infections.

RELATIONSHIP WITH EOSINOPHILS

Another interesting asthma-related finding has been the association between asthma
exacerbation reductions and peripheral blood eosinophil counts.!° In patients with blood
eosinophil counts of greater than 300 or greater than 400 cells/pL, the reduction in
exacerbations noted with omalizumab was 67% and 74%, respectively. Interestingly, data
from this and the Prospective Observational Study to Evaluate Predictors of Clinical
Effectiveness in Response to Omalizumab (PROSPERO) study suggest that exacerbation
reductions relative to blood eosinophil counts are largely driven by the placebo arm because
placebo-assigned participants with high blood eosinophil counts had substantially greater
asthma exacerbation rates compared with placebo-assigned participants with low blood
eosinophil counts.F!

URTICARIA

Omalizumab has transformed the treatment of chronic urticaria (CU) since US Food and
Drug Administration approval for this indication in 2014. The majority of patients with CU
experience substantial benefit from omalizumab, but not all are complete responders, and
some are nonresponders. Recent small studies have identified several response biomarkers.
The serum total IgE ratio of levels obtained before and 4 weeks after omalizumab therapy
initiation demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.95, with ratios of less than 1.9 having

both a sensitivity and a specificity of 93% to predict nonresponse to omalizumab (n = 96).2
Baseline serum total IgE levels (threshold, <43 kU/L) alone showed a 95% negative
predictive value for response. Others have also reported on low baseline serum IgE levels as
negatively predictive of response.©? Conversely, greater baseline basophil FceRIa
expression was 100% sensitive and 72% specific for responsiveness to omalizumab.®*
Importantly, this assay discriminated well between responders and nonresponders; a mean
fluorescence intensity threshold of 5000 for FceRIa by using flow cytometry completely
distinguished responders from nonresponders.

Sera from patients with CU, which activates basophils (increased CD203c levels, as
determined by using flow cytometry), associates with nonresponsiveness to omalizumab.£>
Serum IL-31 levels were found to decrease with omalizumab treatment and not placebo, but
baseline IL-31 levels did not correlate with CU disease activity indexes and did not
distinguish responders from nonresponders.£° A large (n = 470) retrospective study showed
no association between baseline D-dimer levels and omalizumab’s therapeutic response,=7

contradicting prior reports of this biomarker’s predictive ability.©8

Improved patient selection is needed, and optimal duration of omalizumab therapy remains
undetermined. Furthermore, its therapeutic mechanism remains unclear. Indeed, omalizumab
response times in patients with CU seem slower in patients with autoantibodies"?
suggesting that variations in pathogenic mechanisms (IgE-mediated vs IgG-mediated

FceRIa activation) likely underlie differences in response times.

Finally, omalizumab’s performance on several physical urticarias has been recently

reviewed, with the strongest data available for symptomatic dermographism, cold-induced

urticaria, and solar urticaria.E!°

OTHER DISORDERS

Omalizumab has been shown to be beneficial in patients with various other disorders.
Omalizumab facilitates immunotherapy to inhalant, food, and Hymenoptera venom
allergens. A recent phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of children
with peanut allergy undergoing oral immunotherapy showed that omalizumab administration
allowed for tolerance of 2000 mg of peanut on discontinuation of immunotherapy more
often than placebo (23/27 [74%] vs 1/8 [13%], P<.01).£!! Participants assigned to
omalizumab were also less likely to experience adverse reactions to peanut immunotherapy.
Omalizumab has also been shown to improve the safety of oral immunotherapy to other food
allergens administered alone or in combination.£!2 Considering the high burden of disease
posed by food allergy and the important role food desensitizations will likely play in clinical
practice, omalizumab will probably be frequently used to improve safety and efficacy with
oral immunotherapy.

Omalizumab has shown effectiveness in patients with nasal polyps,£!3 and phase 3 studies
for this indication are under way. Many studies have demonstrated therapeutic benefit for
omalizumab in seasonal™!4 and perennial=!5 allergic rhinitis. Small case series show

facilitate aspirin desensitization in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma.§23,E24

Cost ($10,000-$70,000/year [minimum-maximum dose]) largely prevents omalizumab from
wider use for a broader range of allergic, nonallergic, and immunologic conditions, although
most analyses in asthma and CU cohorts have considered it cost-effective when targeted to
select groups.£25-E26 Considering the importance of IgE and cells that bear IgE receptors,
omalizumab will likely continue gaining prominence in the treatment of disorders beyond
allergic asthma and CU.
