The pathophysiology of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is not fully understood; however, it has been hypothesized that a subset of people with CIU may have an autoimmune disease and that peripheral cutaneous nerve
fibers may be involved in CIU. Similarly, it has been postulated that fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is an autoimmune disorder and may be associated with alterations of peripheral cutaneous nerve fibers. Accordingly, the
present study aimed to determine whether the frequency of FMS is higher in patients with CIU.

A total of 72 patients with CIU and 67 sex- and age-matched healthy controls were included. Urticaria activity score (UAS), fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ), tender point number, and visual analogue scale (VAS)
were assessed.

The frequency of FMS was similar between the groups (9.7% vs. 4.5%, p=0.32). However, symptom duration of
FMS was significantly longer, and tender point number and FIQ were significantly higher in patients with CIU
than in controls. In addition, patients with CIU had significantly higher VAS scores. UAS was significantly correlated with presence of FMS, symptom duration of FMS, tender point number, and FIQ and VAS scores. Logistic
regression analysis revealed that UAS was an independent predictor of presence of FMS (=0.34, p=0.003).
Frequency of FMS was slightly, but not significantly, higher in patients with CIU than in controls. However, symptom duration of FMS, tender point number, and FIQ and VAS scores were significantly higher in patients with
CIU, and UAS reflecting severity of the disease was significantly and independently associated with presence
of FMS.

Background

 

Urticaria is a common condition, affecting up to 20% of the
general population. Chronic urticaria (CU) is defined as episodes extending beyond 6 weeks and accounts for 30% of cases [1,2]. The causes of CU cannot be detected in the majority
of cases and, hence, the diagnosis of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is made [3,4]. The incidence of CIU is higher in women
[2]. Although the underlying pathophysiologic causes of CU is
not fully understood in the majority of cases, there has been
substantial evidence that peripheral cutaneous nerve fibers
may be involved, because certain neuropeptides have been
found to be enhanced in CU. In addition, poly-modal and chemo-sensitive small cutaneous nerve fibers have been shown
to participate in skin inflammation [5,6]. Alternatively, it has
been suggested that there is a neuro-immune linkage between
cutaneous sensory nerves and target effector skin cells, causing dysfunctions of peripheral nervous system and pathogenic events in allergic inflammatory skin diseases [6,7].

Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), one of the most common chronic musculoskeletal pain disorders, is defined as presence of
chronic (for 3 months or more) widespread pain and pain on
palpation of at least 11 of 18 tender point sites throughout
the body [8].In addition, several additional symptoms have
been reported in patients with FMS, such as fatigue, sleep disruption, anxiety and depression, headache, and concentration
problems [8]. The prevalence of FMS is higher in women, and it
has been suggested that FMS is a neuropathic pain syndrome
[9,10]. Accordingly, it has been suggested that FMS represents a
state of dysfunction of descending, anti-nociceptive pathways,
and skin biopsies in patients with FMS show both specific receptors and characteristic electron microscope findings, and
increased axon reflex flare reaction to mechanical and chemical stimuli [11]. Moreover, since cutaneous sensory C fibers
can initiate neurogenic inflammation, such neurogenic inflammation is located in the skin of the patients with FMS [12-14].

 

Although substantial evidence exists that CIU is associated
with involvement of peripheral cutaneous nerve fibers, and the
alteration and dysfunction in the peripheral cutaneous nerve
fibers can exist in patients with FMS, there is limited data on
the frequency of FMS in patients with CIU. Accordingly, in the
present study we aimed to evaluate whether the frequency
of FM is higher in patients with CIU.

Material and Methods

 

Study population

A total of 72 patients with CIU (mean age: 36.4+13.0, 25 male)
and 67 sex- and age-matched healthy controls (mean age:

35.5412.1, 20 male) were included. Inclusion criteria were existence of episodes extending beyond 6 weeks duration for patients with CIU. All patients with CIU and controls had no history
of any systemic disease, including musculoskeletal, neurologic, inflammatory, endocrine, or the other clinically significant
chronic diseases. In addition, subjects with excessive alcohol
consumption (>120 g/day) and current smokers were also excluded. To detect disease severity, urticarial activity was measured using the urticarial activity score (UAS) [15,16]. To measure UAS, all patients with CIU were questioned to determine
the number urticarial plaques that occurred within the last
week (0 = none, 1 = mild (<20 plaques/24-hour), 2 = moderate (21-50 plaques/24-hour), and 3 = severe (>50 plaques/24hour), and severity of pruritus (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe) [15,16]. Also, dermatological life quality
index (DLQI) was evaluated in all patients. All patients with
CIU and controls were also questioned in detail to search for
symptoms and signs of FMS. The severity of FMS was detected
using a validated Turkish version of the Fibromyalgia Impact
Questionnaire (FIQ) forms, which contains 10 self-administered instruments covering physical functioning, work status,
depression, anxiety, sleep, pain, stiffness, fatigue, and well-being [17]. A visual analog scale (VAS: from 0 = no pain to 10 =
the worst pain) was used to measure pain score.

Statistical analysis

The analyses were performed using SPSS 9.0 (SPSS for windows
9.0, Chicago, IL). Categorical variables were defined as number
and percentage. Numeric data are expressed as mean +SD. The
groups were compared using the chi-squared test for categorical variables. The t test or Mann-Whitney U test (for comparison of a characteristic across the groups if that characteristic
did not have a normal distribution) was used to compare continuous variables. Correlation analyses were performed using
Pearson or Spearman’s (if the characteristic did not have a normal distribution) correlation matrix. Prediction of independent
variables was obtained by a stepwise, forward, multiple regression model including potential confounders. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was determined to evaluate the
predictive performance of UAS to detect presence of FMS. The
area under the ROC curve (AUC) and its standard error were
calculated. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.

Clinical characteristics of the study population

The groups were comparable in respect to age, sex, place of
residency, education status, and BMI. As expectedly, urticarial activity score was significantly higher in patients with CIU
than in controls. The frequency of FMS was similar between

In patients with CIU, the urticarial activity score was significantly correlated with presence of FMS, symptom duration of FMS,

of FMS, tender point number, and VAS score. Similarly, DLQI

in sex- and age-matched controls (9.7% vs. 4.5%). However,
there were significant differences between the groups in presence of FMS, symptom duration of FMS, tender point number,
and FIQ and VAS scores. Furthermore, in patients with CIU,
UAS (reflecting severity of the disease) was significantly and
independently associated with presence of FMS. UAS was also
correlated with symptom duration of FMS, tender point number, and FIQ and VAS scores.

Although the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms of CIU
are not clearly understood, autoimmunity, which is detected
in 45% of the subjects with CIU, has been suggested as one
of the etiologic factors [18]. Accordingly, Leznoff et al. [19] reported that about 15% of the subjects with CIU had evidence
of associated thyroid autoimmunity, whereas less than 6% of
normal subjects had thyroid autoimmunity. The authors also
found that most patients with thyroid autoimmunity had relentless and severe urticaria and/or angioedema, and they hypothesized that a subset of people with CIU may have an autoimmune disease. In line with these findings, Grattan et al.
[20] showed that 7 of 11 autologous sera from patients with
CIU re-injected intradermal produced a weal at the site of injection, but no response was detected in the 19 control subjects. Moreover, marked neutrophil infiltrate was seen within
and around small dermal blood vessels at the injection site in
the majority of patients with CIU, but this did not correlate with
weal formation. However, the cellular response was mild and
mainly mononuclear in control subjects. Similarly, it has been
postulated that FM is an autoimmune disorder and may include
dysfunction of purine nucleotide metabolism and nociception.

Although both CIU and FMS are postulated to be autoimmune
disorders, there are limited and contradictory data on the

potential association between CIU and FMS. In a pilot study,
Torresani et al. [21] aimed to determine whether patients with
CU were also affected by FMS. The study included a total of
126 patients with CU, and the authors found that, unexpectedly, over 70% of patients with CU had FMS. The corresponding proportion for 50 control dermatological patients was 16%,
which was much higher than the previously published data for
the Italian general population (2.2%). The authors hypothesized
that dysfunctional cutaneous nerve fibers of patients with fibromyalgia syndrome may release neuropeptides, which, in
turn, may induce dermal micro-vessel dilatation and plasma
extravasation. They have also postulated that some neuropeptides may favor mast cell degranulation, which stimulates nerve
endings, thus providing positive feedback. They concluded that
in many patients CU may thus be viewed as a consequence of
FMS, and speculated that skin neuropathy or FMS may trigger
neurogenic skin inflammation resulting in CU. In contrast, Hapa
et al. [22] recently reported that only 26% of patients with CU
and 20.8% of controls had FMS and no significant difference
was observed between the groups. They also suggested that
there is no significant difference between patients with positive autologous serum skin test and patients with negative autologous serum skin test, and no significant difference was observed in the frequency of FMS between the patients, either
when divided into 2 groups according to UAS or when divided
into 2 groups according to disease duration. In line with the results of Hapa et al., in the present study there was no statistically significant difference between the patients with CIU and
controls in the frequency of FMS. However, in our study, symptom duration of FMS, tender point number, and FIQ and VAS
scores were significantly different between the groups. Other
contrasting findings in our study were that UAS reflecting severity of the disease was significantly and independently associated with presence of FMS, and UAS was also correlated with
symptom duration of FMS, tender point number, and FIQ and
VAS scores. In addition, we found that UAS was an accurate
and significant predictor of the presence of FMS on the ROC
curve, and the best cut-off value of UAS to predict presence of
FMS was 5, with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 72%.

Conclusions

 

The findings of the present study suggest that, as compared to
sex- and age-matched healthy controls, FMS was slightly, but
not significantly, more frequent in patients with CIU. However,
there were significant differences between the groups in respect to symptom duration of FMS, tender point number, and
FIQ and VAS scores. Furthermore, in patients with CIU, UAS
(reflecting severity of the disease) was significantly and independently associated with the presence of FMS, and the best
cut-off value of UAS to predict presence of FMS was 5, with
a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 72%. UAS was also
