ARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT

 

Background: Evidence has shown that omalizumab, a subcutaneous anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, is highly
effective for the treatment of chronic urticaria.

Article history:

Received in revised form November 28, i
2013 setting.

Methods: This prospective open-label study evaluated of 150 mg of omalizumab in severe urticaria defined
by a 7-day urticaria activity score (UAS-7) higher than 30, a history of oral glucocorticoid use, and by
suboptimal response to previous treatments. Two subgroups of patients at different centers (Toronto and
Quebec City, Canada) were included. The primary efficacy evaluation was a change in UAS-7 from baseline. A
quantitative medication score assessed the use of other anti-urticarial medications.
Results: Sixty-eight patients were included: 61 with chronic spontaneous urticaria, 6 with cold urticaria, and
1 with urticarial vasculitis. Patients were followed for up to 25 months. In Toronto, mean UAS-7 decreased
from 32.2 at baseline to 5.7 after the last omalizumab treatment. Seventy-nine percent achieved complete
remission during omalizumab therapy (UAS-7 0) and 6 (18%) showed improvement but never achieved
complete remission. The most common maintenance dosing intervals were 1 to 3 months. In Quebec City,
from baseline to 18 months, mean UAS-7 decreased from 24.4 to 2.2 and the quantitative medication score
decreased from 13.3 to 3.0. All 6 patients with cold urticaria became symptom free, with a significant
decrease of their cold stimulation tolerance test.
Conclusion: Omalizumab 150 mg was effective in difficult to treat patients with severe, chronic urticaria
refractory to recommended treatments who usually required prednisone. Omalizumab induced a longlasting positive response and was well tolerated without side effects.

Introduction oral H,-blocking antihistamine, with subsequent dose titration up
to 4 times the recommended pharmacologic dose.’ However, more
than half of patients with CSU do not respond adequately to antihistamines.® Until now, the next-line intervention with quality
evidence for efficacy has been cyclosporine A, but its use is limited
by the high incidence of adverse events.’ Other options with lowerquality evidence include leukotriene antagonists and hydroxychloroquine. According to consensus guidelines, the use of systemic
glucocorticoids should be limited to treat exacerbations,’ but in
real-life clinical practice, the severity and lack of effective treatments have necessitated their long-term use in many patients,
which has been associated with many potential toxicities.°

There is limited evidence available for effective treatments in
patients with cold-induced urticaria who do not respond to antihistamine therapy.’

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is defined as the presence
of spontaneously occurring hives and/or angioedema with variable
degrees of pruritus for a period longer than 6 weeks.' CSU, which
was formerly referred to as chronic idiopathic urticaria, is quite
common in generalist and specialist practices; the estimated lifetime prevalence is 0.5% to 1.0%.” The impact of the condition can be
substantial, with patients affected by CSU potentially experiencing
substantial disability, decreased quality of life, psychological and
emotional distress, and decreased productivity.*° Although the
requirement for chronicity is only 6 weeks’ duration, CSU can
persist for years; a 2004 study showed that it lasted longer than
1 year in 70% of patients and persisted longer than 5 years in 14%.°

Chronic spontaneous urticaria is difficult to treat in many

patients. The recommended first-line treatment is a nonsedating

Methods
Rationale

This is a prospective, real-life study of patients with severe,
refractory chronic urticaria treated with omalizumab at 2 Canadian
centers (Division of Allergy, Clinical Immunology, St Michael’s
Hospital, Toronto, Ontario and Clinique d’asthme et d’allergie de
Québec, Quebec City, Quebec).

In many of the published omalizumab trials, patients with
clinically severe disease have been included, but they were treated
only with antihistamines. In real life, many patients who are clinically severe do not respond to first-, second-, or third-line treatments and often require systemic glucocorticoids to achieve
comfort. The present study and other recently published work'®??
have assessed the effectiveness of omalizumab in this population.

In addition, the present cohort includes a small subset of
patients with cold urticaria, a population for which therapeutic
options are limited.’ As such, the present study adds valuable
information to the substantial and growing evidence base for
omalizumab for the treatment of urticaria.

Objectives

The objectives of this study were to evaluate omalizumab, at a
dose of 150 mg/month, in severe, difficult-to-treat, chronic urticaria, by assessing the impact on clinical severity, time to induce
remission, and dose schedule necessary to induce and sustain longterm remission.

Patients

Patients included in this study at the Toronto and Quebec City
centers had severe disease as defined by any of the following
criteria: 7-day urticaria activity score (UAS-7) higher than 30, a
history of repeated administration of oral corticosteroid use, and by
the lack of adequate response to recommended treatments. The
UAS-7 is a validated tool used to assess urticaria severity.” Briefly,
the symptoms were monitored by numbers of hives (none, 0 point;
<10 per day, 1 point; 10—50 per day, 2 points; >50 per day, 3
points) and the intensity of pruritus (none, 0 point; mild, 1 point;
moderate, 2 points; severe, 3 points) each day for 7 days, for a
maximum total score of 42 points.

Intervention

All patients were treated with subcutaneous omalizumab. The
dosing and schedule of the study drug differed at the 2 centers. In
Toronto, the dose was 150 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 3
to 5 treatments. Based on the patient’s response to these initial
doses, alternative dosing frequencies were determined on an ondemand basis. If patients responded to treatment and required
maintenance dosing, the dosing interval was individualized as
required, often extending to every 6 to 8 weeks. Patients who
achieved complete remission had their treatment discontinued
until they needed more drug. In the Quebec City cohort, the planned dose was 150 mg of omalizumab per month. Dose adjustments
were possible based on clinical response.

The treating physicians made adjustments to concomitant
medications according to the clinical response. Patients who were
receiving oral glucocorticoids at baseline and who benefited from
omalizumab treatment were tapered off oral glucocorticoids as
tolerated. The use of non-study medications was documented at
baseline and throughout follow-up.

Assessments

The primary efficacy assessment used in each of the 2 centers
was the UAS-7, which was collected from patient diaries and
compared with baseline. Use of concomitant medications was
documented through the review of medical records before baseline
and recorded by the treating physicians using quantitative medication score assessments. This represented the sum of weighted
scores for the use of antihistamines (regular dose, 2 points; 4 times
the regular dose, 8 points), oral glucocorticoids (<11 mg, 5 points;
11—25 mg, 10 points; >25 mg, 15 points), cyclosporine 3.0 mg/kg (8
points), hydroxychloroquine (6 points) and montelukast (2 points).

Time to remission and the dosing interval required to maintain
remission were documented. Remission was defined as a complete
absence of urticarial lesions and pruritus (UAS-7 0).

Adverse events and serious adverse events were documented by
the physicians at each center.

Investigators in the Toronto subgroup obtained approval from
the Canadian SHIELD ethics review board. However, for this study,
approval from an institutional review board was not necessary,
because the analyses were performed on data recorded during the
routine treatment of patients. All patients at the 2 centers provided
oral informed consent.

 

Results
Patient Characteristics

Sixty-eight patients with severe chronic urticaria were included
in this study: 61 with CSU, 6 with cold urticaria, and 1 with urticarial vasculitis (Table 1). Thirty-four patients (all with CSU) were
from the Toronto center and 34 were from Quebec City. All patients
were treated with at least 1 dose of subcutaneous omalizumab.

In the Toronto subgroup, mean disease duration was 8.2 years
(range 0.25—34 years). Twenty-six of the 34 patients had a documented history of angioedema. Two of the 34 patients had documented concomitant asthma. Approximately two thirds of patients
were women (23 of 34) and the mean age was 47.6 years (range
10—68 years).

Of the 34 patients in the Quebec City subgroup, 27 (79.4%) were
women and the mean age was 42.9 years (range 7—78 years).
Twenty-seven of the 34 patients had a diagnosis of CSU, 6 had cold
urticaria (acquired cold urticaria with daily symptoms), and 1 had
urticarial vasculitis.

Treatment History

All patients with CSU had been treated previously with Hblocking antihistamines and all had a history of treatment with oral
glucocorticoids (except patients with cold urticaria; Table 1).

In the Toronto cohort, the most frequently used antihistamine
was cetirizine, at doses up to 80 mg/d. Other antihistamines, such
as hydroxyzine, doxepin, or desloratadine, were used. Most
patients had been on other third-line therapies (eg, hydroxychloroquine, intravenous immunoglobulin, and cyclosporine). At
the time of omalizumab initiation, 25 of 34 had an open prescription for prednisone with variable dosages and schedules, including
on an as-needed basis.

In the Quebec City cohort, in addition to H;-blocking antihistamines (agents and doses as those in the Toronto subgroup),
patients were being treated with additional therapies at the time of
omalizumab initiation, including leukotriene antagonists (10
patients) and cyclosporine (7 patients). The Quebec City patients
(except those with cold urticaria or contraindications) who were
not on cyclosporine at the time of omalizumab previously had a
trial with cyclosporine. Six of the 34 patients had open prescriptions for prednisone at the time of omalizumab initiation.

 

Omalizumab Treatment

In the Toronto group, 30 of the 34 patients received omalizumab
at a dose of 150 mg. Four patients received higher initial doses
based on IgE levels. The number of treatments ranged from 2 to 23.
The duration of follow-up is presented in Table 2. After a remission
was achieved, patients were offered an on-demand schedule,
which allowed the capture of treatment intervals. Although some
patients received omalizumab at a regular interval once every
month (11 of 34 patients, 32%), for the other 23 patients, there was
variability in the dosing interval. These patients returned for
follow-up omalizumab treatments only if they experienced a flare
of their urticaria. The dose interval for the patients who had
reached maintenance stage (ie, had received >5 injections, n = 14)
was 1 to 3 months for 71% (10 of 14), with an interval range of 2
weeks to 7 months.

In the Quebec City subgroup, 26 of the 34 patients initially
received 150 mg/month subcutaneously. Seven patients (including
2 patients with cold urticaria) received 300 mg/month subcutaneously (because of concomitant atopic disease) and the patient
with urticarial vasculitis received 150 mg every other week (owing

to a partial response to the first dose). Subsequent dose adjustments were made in 2 patients with CSU: 1 patient’s dose was
uptitrated to 375 mg every other week at week 10 and the other
patient’s dose was increased to 300 mg/month after 1 year at the
initial dosage. The 2 adjustments were due to an insufficient
response to the lower dose. The duration of follow-up was 6
months or shorter for 21 patients (62%), 6 months to 1 year for 6
patients (18%), and 1 to 2 years for 7 patients (21%; Table 2).

Primary Efficacy Variable (UAS-7)

In the patients with CSU or urticarial vasculitis, the mean UAS-7
before omalizumab treatment was 28.1 (32.2 in the Toronto group
and 24.4 in the Quebec City group). In the subgroup of patients with
cold urticaria, the mean UAS-7 before omalizumab was 16.9,
because of cold avoidance strategies.

For the patients in the Toronto subgroup, the mean UAS-7
during the 4 weeks after the last omalizumab treatment was 5.7,
an absolute improvement of 26.5 points (Fig 1). Twenty-seven of
the 34 patients (79%) achieved complete remission (UAS-7 0) at
some point during omalizumab therapy. Fifteen patients achieved
remission after the first injection, 6 after the second, 4 after the
third, and 2 after the fourth. Six patients (18%) showed improvement but did not achieve complete remission. One patient was
completely refractory to omalizumab and 3 additional patients who
initially responded (2 with complete remissions and 1 with
improvement without remission) became refractory to omalizumab during the period of observation.

In the Quebec City subgroup, overall mean UAS-7 decreased
substantially from before treatment through to 18 months. The
mean scores during this period were (excluding patients with cold
urticaria) 24.4 before treatment, 10.1 at 1 month, 5.4 at 3 months,
4.7 at 6 months, 2.5 at 12 months, and 2.2 at 18 months (Fig 2).

Sixteen of 28 patients in this subgroup (57%) achieved complete
remission during follow-up. Eleven more patients showed
improvement on omalizumab therapy but did not achieve remission. One patient did not experience any meaningful improvement
and discontinued omalizumab therapy after 3 months. The proportions of patients who achieved remission (UAS-7 0) were 17.9%
(5 of 28) at 1 month, 51.9% (14 of 27) at 3 months, 60.0% (12 of 20) at
6 months, 54.5% (6 of 11) at 12 months, and 71.4% (5 of 7) at 18
months.

Cold Urticaria: Cold Stimulation Tolerance Test

In the subgroup of 6 patients with cold urticaria, all became
symptom free on omalizumab, with a significant decrease of their
cold stimulation tolerance test results.

Concomitant Medication Use

In the Toronto cohort, the mean medication score at the time of
omalizumab initiation was 12.8. The mean baseline medication
score in the 28 Quebec City patients (excluding those with cold
urticaria) was 13.3.

Overall and in the 2 subgroups, omalizumab therapy led to a
decrease in the use of concomitant medications. In the Toronto
subgroup, after omalizumab therapy, the mean medication score
was 2.5 (change from baseline —10.3). Of the 25 patients who had a
prescription for prednisone at the initiation of omalizumab therapy,
7 patients continued to require prednisone during the omalizumab
treatment period. Four of these patients required prednisone only
when the effects of omalizumab had worn off and they responded
to additional injections. Three other patients, although they
initially responded with partial (1 patient) or complete (2 patients)
remission, became refractory and maintained their prednisone
doses. In the Quebec City group, the quantitative medication score
decreased from 13.3 at baseline to 12.0 at 1 month, 9.2 at 3 months,
4.7 at 6 months, 5.3 at 12 months, and 3.0 at 18 months (Fig 3). Of
the 6 patients who were on prednisone at baseline, 4 were able to
discontinue the oral glucocorticoid completely, 1 was able to lower
the dose from 10 to 5 mg, and 1 maintained a 10-mg dose.

Safety Observations

No serious adverse events were reported during the study.

Discussion

This study was carried out to assess the efficacy of omalizumab,
at a low dose, in patients with severe chronic urticaria not
responding to recommended therapies and often requiring systemic steroids to control exacerbations, as seen in a real-life setting.
Two centers were involved, using slightly different approaches: in
Toronto, a positive response was induced with monthly treatment
and then patients were given the opportunity to continue on an ondemand basis. In Quebec City, patients were treated regularly on a
monthly basis. The clinical response was assessed by measuring
clinical activity using the UAS-7 system and by monitoring the use
of concomitant medication.

Most patients with CSU experienced a remarkable response to
omalizumab: 43 of 62 (69%) achieved complete remission. This
positive clinical response was accompanied by decreases in other
anti-urticarial medications, including glucocorticoids. Indeed, only 8
patients required systemic glucocorticoid therapy, 4 of whom, from
the Toronto group, used prednisone only as a bridging intervention
until the next omalizumab dose was administered. Significant clinical responses to omalizumab in chronic urticaria have been reported
previously, but the present patients had symptoms that were more
severe than in most other published studies, in which patients were
significantly affected clinically but were not on medication during
the observation period. The present group would not have been able
to remain free of medication for any period. Most patients had been
on glucocorticoids at some point, and many had open prescriptions
for systemic glucocorticoids, which they used when needed.

The present results also support the efficacy of the 150-mg dose
every 4 weeks for chronic urticaria despite disease severity. Of the
43 patients who achieved remission in the present study, 40 were
treated with the 150-mg dose. Although good results were seen in
patients who received their injections of omalizumab on a fixed
schedule, patients in the on-demand Toronto subgroup whose
response disappeared and showed flare-ups at variable times after
their last dose of omalizumab could recapture their response with a
subsequent injection. These observations suggest that fixed and ondemand dosing strategies are viable alternatives for omalizumab
therapy in severe CSU.

In addition, it is important to remember that this study was selffunded and patients in the Toronto subgroup were completely
responsible for the costs of therapy (approximately Can $700 per
150-mg injection in the province of Ontario). For Quebec City
patients, drug costs were reimbursed by private or public insurers,
each of whom had to be convinced of the therapeutic value of
omalizumab before the drug could be approved for this use. Despite
these limitations, 68 patients were enrolled. The fact that almost all
patients stayed on omalizumab reflects the effectiveness of this
intervention compared with the options they had tried previously.

Moreover, in the present cohort, patients were observed for a
longer period than in most other reported studies (up to 25
months). The sustained efficacy and lack of serious adverse events
during this period are encouraging observations for this intervention and provide further support for long-term use of this intervention. However, it should be noted that few patients (5 of 62, 8%)
became refractory to treatment.

Further, the response to omalizumab in the small group of
patients with cold urticaria was noteworthy. All 6 of these patients
became asymptomatic and showed a significantly improved skin
reaction to the cold stimulation tolerance test. Although the number of patients was small, this remains an encouraging development in this subset of patients with urticaria for whom treatment
options are limited.

In conclusion, the present real-life study adds to the growing
evidence base in support of the use of omalizumab for chronic
urticaria. This evolving evidence base heralds a paradigm shift in
174 G. Sussman et al. / Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol 112 (2014) 170—174

the treatment of these patients. The compelling data from research
with omalizumab, including the data for patients with the severe
form in the present study, show that many of these previously
difficult-to-treat patients can achieve complete, sustained
responses while being spared from the toxicity associated with oral
glucocorticoids. Future updates of clinical practice recommendations should consider the key results of this study: despite severe
disease, a 150-mg dose of omalizumab was sufficient to induce
complete remission in most patients, and maintenance doses could
be given every 6 to 12 weeks.
