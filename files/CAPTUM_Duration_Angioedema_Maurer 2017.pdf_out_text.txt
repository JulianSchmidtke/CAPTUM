Abstract

Background: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) can be debilitating, difficult to
treat, and frustrating for patients and physicians. Real-world evidence for the burden of CSU is limited. The objective of this study was to document disease duration, treatment history, and disease activity, as well as impact on health-related
quality of life (HRQoL) and work among patients with inadequately controlled CSU,
and to describe its humanistic, societal, and economic burden.

Methods: This international observational study assessed a cohort of 673 adult
patients with CSU whose symptoms persisted for >12 months despite treatment.
Demographics, disease characteristics, and healthcare resource use in the previous
12 months were collected from medical records. Patient-reported data on urticaria
and angioedema symptoms, HRQoL, and work productivity and activity impairment
were collected from a survey and a diary.

Results: Almost 50% of patients had moderate-to-severe disease activity as
reported by Urticaria Activity Score. Mean (SD) Dermatology Life Quality Index and
Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire scores were 9.1 (6.62) and 33.6
(20.99), respectively. Chronic spontaneous urticaria markedly interfered with sleep
and daily activities. Angioedema in the previous 12 months was reported by 66% of
enrolled patients and significantly affected HRQoL. More than 20% of patients
reported >1 hour per week of missed work; productivity impairment was 27%.
These effects increased with increasing disease activity. Significant healthcare
resources and costs were incurred to treat CSU.

Conclusions: Chronic spontaneous urticaria has considerable humanistic and economic impacts. Patients with greater disease activity and with angioedema experience greater HRQoL impairments.

1 | INTRODUCTION

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) (also called chronic idiopathic
urticaria)* is characterized by the occurrence of urticaria for 6 weeks
or longer without identifiable specific triggers.? The average duration
of CSU is frequently reported as 5 years*° but may be longer in
more severe cases*“—specifically, in patients with concurrent
angioedema,*°” CSU in combination with inducible urticaria,*” or a
positive autologous serum skin test.1® The estimated point prevalence of CSU is approximately 0.5% to 1%.? Until omalizumab was
approved in early 2014, H,-antihistamines were the only approved
medication for CSU and were the mainstay of symptomatic treatment. However, over 60% of patients remain symptomatic despite
treatment with second-generation H,-antihistamines at the licensed
dose.?°

Available evidence indicates that all forms of chronic urticaria
can substantially affect patients’ quality of life (QoL), ability to perform daily tasks, and mental health.114 Patients with chronic urticaria (used as a proxy for CSU) experience substantial health-related
quality of life (HRQoL) and productivity impairments and increased
psychological comorbidities relative to patients without chronic urticaria.1>?” Nevertheless, real-world research quantifying the humanistic and economic impact of diagnosed CSU is limited, and a
number of unmet needs exist in this patient population,’ particularly
among those refractory to standard treatment.

The ASSURE-CSU (ASSessment of the Economic and Humanistic
Burden of Chronic Spontaneous/Idiopathic URticaria patiEnts) study
sought to improve understanding of CSU and to explore the unmet
needs of patients whose disease has persisted for longer than
12 months and is inadequately controlled by standard treatment.
Specifically, the main objectives of this study were to characterize,
in this population, disease duration, disease activity, and treatment
history, as well as to identify and quantify the humanistic, societal,

and economic burden of CSU.

2 | METHODS

2.1 | Study design and participants

The study design has previously been described in detail.1® Briefly,
this noninterventional, multinational, and multicenter study was conducted in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands,
and the United Kingdom (UK). Recruitment of 700 patients was
planned. Data collection occurred from October 2013 until May
2015, with each center recruiting over a 4-month period. Figure $1
describes the patient selection process. Eligible patients were adults

with a clinician-confirmed diagnosis of CSU? who had received at

least one treatment course with an H41-antihistamine and were
symptomatic despite treatment.*®

The study was reviewed and exempted by the RTI International
Institutional Review Board and was reviewed and approved by the
relevant national, local, and site-level ethics committees. The study
was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki;7° all

patients provided written informed consent.

2.2 | Study measures

The study included a 12-month retrospective medical record abstraction, a cross-sectional patient survey administered at enrollment, and
a patient diary completed over an 8-day period after recruitment

21-25 26-28 included

(Figure 1). Both the survey’ and the patient diary’
study-specific questions and validated PRO measures (Table S1 in
Appendix $1).

Direct and indirect costs were estimated for each country. Direct
costs included CSU-related treatments, physician visits, emergency
department (ED) visits, and hospitalizations documented in medical
records, as well as CSU-related alternative medicine, other out-ofpocket costs, and transportation reported in the patient survey. Indirect costs included the cost of patient-reported workdays missed

and lost productivity due to CSU.

2.3 | Data analysis

Data analyses were descriptive. Data from all countries were pooled
for all outcomes except for direct and indirect costs. With the
exception of imputation of missing start dates for therapy data, no
imputation of missing data was performed, and no formal hypothesis
testing was conducted. Descriptive tables were generated overall
and stratified by Urticaria Activity Score over 7 days, twice-daily
assessment (UAS7) score bands. These score bands categorize the
UAS7 into four levels of disease activity: UAS7=0-6 (urticaria-free or
well-controlled urticaria activity), 7-15 (mild activity), 16-27 (moderate activity), and 28-42 (severe activity).2?°° Mean values, standard
deviations (SDs), medians, and ranges were computed for continuous
variables; counts were collected and percentages were computed for
categorical variables. All analyses were performed using SAS version
9.3 or later (Cary, North Carolina, USA: SAS Institute, Inc.; 2011).
For the direct cost calculations, costing algorithms were used to
assign 2014 unit costs from published sources in the respective
country’s currency to the resource utilization data.°* Indirect costs
for workdays missed and lost productivity due to CSU were calculated by the human capital approach using each country’s specific
average wage and hours worked.2? Pooled cost calculations were

not conducted. Country costs were converted to purchasing power

3 | RESULTS

3.1 | Patient population

A total of 673 patients were enrolled in 64 recruiting centers, primarily hospital-based specialist centers (Table S2 in Appendix $2).
Most enrolled patients were female (72.7%) and Caucasian/white
(90.4%), with a mean (SD) age of 48.8 (15.47) years (Table 1). The
mean (SD) duration of disease from symptom onset to diagnosis
was 24.0 (63.36) months (median 4.7 months) and from diagnosis
to the time of study enrollment was 57.7 (77.79) months (median
27.7 months). At diagnosis, 11.2% of patients were assessed by
their physician as having mild CSU, 31.4% as moderate, and
36.5% as severe; severity at diagnosis was not available for 21.0%
of patients (Table S3 in Appendix $3). Most physicians reported
using a combination of factors to assess CSU severity, including
number, duration, and intensity of flares (58.5%) and impact on
QoL (38.0%); some reported using validated PRO measures, including the UAS7 (15.9%). Allergic rhinitis (16.5%), personal history or
family history of allergic disease (14.0% and 14.1%, respectively),
and asthma (11.3%) were the most frequently reported additional conditions present at enrollment; concomitant autoimmune diseases,
(Table 1).

including Hashimoto's, were not uncommon

3.2 | Urticaria activity

The overall mean (SD) UAS7 score was 17.3 (10.49), suggesting
moderate patient-reported disease activity over 7 days despite
treatment. Of the 605 people for whom a UAS7 score could be
calculated, 299 (49.4%) had moderate-to-severe activity despite
treatment, with mean (SD) UAS7 scores of 21.5 (3.39) in the
moderate and 33.3 (3.93) in the severe activity groups (Fig
ure 2).

3.3. | CSU has a major impact on HRQoL, sleep, and
daily life

Mean (SD) total scores for the Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life
Questionnaire (CU-Qz0L) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)
were 33.6 (20.99) and 9.1 (6.62), respectively; 41.6% of patients had
a mean DLQI score of 10 or above. The mean (SD) utility score estimate based on the generic EQ-5D-3L index was 0.714 (0.2907).

Overall, the most affected aspects of HRQoL were physical
symptoms/discomfort, emotional well-being, interference with daily
activities, sleep, and work performance (Figure 3). The most affected
domains of the CU-Q,oL?° were pruritus (mean [SD] score, 55.2
[27.88]), sleep problems (38.3 [25.69]), and looks (35.5 [25.34]) (Figure 3A). Among the six DLQI domains, negative impact was greatest
on symptoms and feelings and daily activities (3.0 [1.63] and
1.9 [1.72], respectively, of a maximum possible domain score of 6)
and work and school (1.6 [0.97] of a maximum possible domain
score of 3) (Figure 3B). The EQ-5D-3L domains for which patients
most frequently reported moderate or extreme problems were pain/
discomfort (63.2% of patients), anxiety/depression (47.4%), and usual
activities (34.2%) (Figure 3C).

Chronic spontaneous urticaria also had an impact on sleep and
daily activities, as shown by weekly mean (SD) scores on the interference with sleep (6.6 [5.93]) and interference with daily activities
(6.4 [5.55]) domains of the Urticaria Patient Daily Diary (UPDD) (Figure 3D). The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI)
results substantiated these findings: One-third of patients reported
considerable impairments (mean [SD] 32.8% [28.96%]) in daily nonwork activities.

Across nearly all HRQoL domains, impact increased with increasing CSU activity.

3.4 | CSU-associated angioedema is a common and
debilitating problem

According to medical records, 58.5% (394 of 673) patients were
reported to have had CSU-associated angioedema, and 41.0%

(276 of 673) had experienced CSU-associated angioedema within
the past 12 months from inclusion. According to the patient survey, 65.8% of patients (427 of 649) reported experiencing
angioedema during the previous 12 months; of these, 75.2% (321
of 427) reported having experienced angioedema within the past
4 weeks. Patients with angioedema reported on a scale of 0-10
the amount of itching (mean [SD] 7.2 [2.16]), swelling (7.3
[2.73]), and pain (5.4 [3.39]) they experienced during a typical
episode over the past 12 months. When asked what they would
typically do when they experienced angioedema, 21.5% of
patients reported that they would go to the ED for treatment,
12.9% would take an over-the-counter medication, and 19.9%
would do nothing. During the 7-day UPDD period, 47.9% of
patients (294 of 614) reported at least 1 day of angioedema.
Occurrence of angioedema increased with disease activity, as
more than two-thirds of patients (70.1%) in the UAS7 28-42
band reported experiencing angioedema on at least 1 of 7 consecutive days. The mean (SD) number of days with angioedema
ranged from 2.3 (1.60) among patients in the UAS7 0-6 band to
4.1 (2.18) days among patients in the UAS7 28-42 band.
Angioedema significantly affected HRQoL, particularly emotional well-being. Mean (SD) Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (AE-QoL) scores were 65.0 (25.14) on the fears/shame
domain and 52.1 (25.83) on the fatigue/mood domain among all
patients experiencing angioedema; patients with greater CSU
activity reported more significant impacts on these domains (Fig
ure 4).

3.5 | CSU affects work performance and
productivity

Of the 604 patients reporting, 341 (56.5%) indicated that they
were currently employed. Among employed patients, the mean
(SD) absenteeism, presenteeism, and overall work impairment were
6.1% (17.83%), 25.2% (25.78%), and 26.9% (27.53%), respectively,
over the previous 7 days. Among the 329 employed patients
responding, 72 (21.9%) had missed at least 1 hour of work in the
past 7 days because of problems associated with CSU; among
these, 45 patients (62.5%) missed up to 1 day of work and 27
(37.5%) missed more than 1 day in the past 7 days. The main reasons affecting capacity to work were itching (39.8%) and angioedema (28.2%).

Disease activity affected work performance, and greater disease
activity had a greater negative productivity impact: mean (SD) overall
work productivity loss was 11.9% (21.55%) among those with lowest
disease activity and 43.6% (28.38%) among those with highest disease
activity. Presenteeism (ie, impairment while at work) was the primary
driver for overall work productivity loss, ranging from a mean (SD) of
9.8% (15.94%) among those with lowest disease activity to 40.4%
(27.42%) among those with highest disease activity (Figure S2 in
Appendix $2).

3.6 | Treatment of inadequately controlled CSU is
frequently inconsistent with guideline
recommendations

In the preceding 12 months, 90.9% of patients received at least one(Figure 5), and 45.2% of

patients received updosing of H,-antihistamines, or combinations of

second-generation H-antihistamine
H,-antihistamines plus leukotriene receptor antagonists (6.7%), or
H.-antihistamines (1.3%) or ciclosporin (1.2%), but remained symptomatic. Contrary to clinical guidelines,** 17.7% of patients received
first-generation H,-antihistamines, and 19.3% of patients received
oral corticosteroids for a mean (SD) duration of treatment of 153.2
(127.77) days (median, 118.0; range, 1.0-366.0 days). Nearly one in
five patients (18.1%) were not taking any therapy at enrollment.

3.7. | CSU has a considerable impact on healthcare
resources

Overall, 72.1% of patients had at least one visit to a healthcare professional for their CSU recorded in their medical record in the previous 12 months, with a mean (SD) of 3.3 (3.03) visits. According to
medical records, consultant allergists (39.0%) and dermatologists
(38.5%) were the most common specialists visited in the 12 months
prior to enrollment. Among the 97 patients (14.4%) with at least one
CSU-related ED visit in the past 12 months, the annual mean (SD)
number of visits was 1.8 (1.26). Hospitalization for CSU was
recorded for 55 patients (8.2%), with a mean (SD) length of stay per
hospitalization of 3.7 (2.67) days; 53.8% of hospital admissions were
due to nonspecified diagnostic testing, 17.3% were due to angioe
dema, and the remaining admissions were for other unspecified

reasons. Based on patients’ survey responses, in the prior 3 months,
patients most frequently visited a family doctor (44.8%) a mean (SD)
of 2.7 (3.02) times (among patients with such a visit); 37.4%
reported seeing a dermatologist a mean (SD) of 2.5 (2.55) times

(among patients with such a visit).

3.8 | CSU is costly for society

Total average (SD) annual direct costs per patient per year, as captured in the retrospective medical record review, ranged from PPP
$907.1 ($2431.14) in Italy to PPP$2984.2 ($8969.46) in France. The
major drivers of these costs were therapies (range, PPP$426.4$1788.7) and inpatient visits (range, PPP$250.7-$1074.4) (Tables S5
and S6 in Appendix S5 and S6).

Average indirect costs, or costs of patient-reported total work
productivity loss over 4 weeks, were driven primarily by the cost
of presenteeism (range, PPP$544.5-$1180.0); the mean (SD) cost
of work productivity loss ranged from PPP$544.8 ($603.22) in
France to PPP$1287.4 ($1123.80) in Germany (Table $7 in
Appendix S7).

4 | DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, the ASSURE-CSU study is the first international
analysis of the burden of CSU inadequately controlled by standard
treatment. We report novel findings for current treatment patterns, impact on HRQoL, and the economic burden to patients,
healthcare systems, and society. A key strength is the use of a

patient survey and retrospective medical record review to provide

more comprehensive evidence than is captured using only administrative data sources (e.g., medical claims). As both disease activity
and HRQoL were evaluated over a similar period, the impact of
varying levels of disease activity on patients’ lives was clarified.
Moreover, we identified significant humanistic and economic burdens relating to CSU that have not been reported previously. Nevertheless, estimates of disease burden from this study may be
conservative, and the observed treatment patterns might not

represent the general CSU population. Patients were recruited

from urticaria specialty centers and, as such, were receiving expert
care for CSU.

Most patients in ASSURE-CSU had moderate-to-severe physician-assessed disease activity at diagnosis, and patients experienced a mean delay of 24 months (and a median delay of nearly
5 months) from symptom onset to diagnosis; mean duration from
diagnosis to enrollment was nearly 5 years. Most patients continued to have moderate-to-severe disease activity (ie, moderate-to
severe itch and hives at least 4 days a week) while completing

angioedema over the past 4 wk in the patient survey. Some patients had insufficient data to calculate one or more AE-QoL domain scores

the patient diary. However, treatment could be suboptimal and in
fact was absent for some patients during the study period.
Patients not receiving treatment may have discontinued previous
treatments owing to ineffectiveness or cost factors, among other
reasons.

Angioedema was found to be more frequent than previously
thought: Physicians reported that nearly 60% of patients with CSU
experienced angioedema, and two-thirds of them had experienced it
within the past 12 months. More patients than physicians reported
angioedema during this time period and reported its considerable
impact on emotional well-being, fatigue, and mood. Our findings suggest that angioedema plays a significant role in the burden of CSU,
affecting every aspect of HRQoL and driving direct costs. Further
analyses of ASSURE-CSU data are ongoing to examine the misalignment between physicians’ and patients’ reports and to better understand the impact of angioedema.

Mean DLQI scores in this study suggest that CSU has a moderate impact on patients’ HRQoL,?° which is greater than previously
thought; further, more than 40% had DLQI scores of 10 or greater,
which, in psoriasis, justifies the initiation of a biologic.>° In addition,
HRQoL impairments correlated with disease activity, notably so in
daily activity and sleep interference domains across measures. Particularly in patients with a UAS7 of 16 or greater, overall impact of
CSU on usual activities represents a significant burden to themselves

and to society.

Some notable differences were observed between patient and
physician reporting, potentially suggesting that patients may not
always communicate their urticaria symptoms to their physicians, in
turn mitigating physicians’ ability to treat effectively. Unanswered
questions remain about patients’ abilities to accurately identify or
recall angioedema symptoms and physicians’ likelihood of capturing
these events in medical records. Discrepancies also existed between
physicians’ and patients’ reports of resources used—specifically visits
to other healthcare professionals and medications, particularly alternative therapies (eg, homeopathic treatments), that the patient was
using. More research is needed to fully address these differences
and provide education and resources to patients and providers alike.

ASSessment of the Economic and Humanistic Burden of Chronic
Spontaneous/Idiopathic URticaria patiEnts provides valuable insight
into the economic burden of CSU. To our knowledge, only a US
claims database analysis,>” a small US single-center analysis,°° and a
cost-effectiveness analysis in France®? have previously evaluated
CSU-associated costs, and none is directly comparable with our
study. Although previously thought to be infrequent, CSU-related
ED visits in ASSURE-CSU were reported for 14% of patients, and
hospitalizations were reported for 8% of patients. This is in contrast
to Broder and colleagues’®” findings in the United States that 2% of
patients with CSU (of any severity) had CSU-related ED visits and
0.1% of patients were hospitalized. Differences in national health
care systems and in CSU severity among the study populations may

methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil; other specified therapies included intravenous immunoglobulin, narrowband ultraviolet B procedure,

combinations of second- and/or third-generation H1-antihistamine therapies, as well as patients who have multiple records of the same

H,-antihistamine

contribute to the discrepancy in hospitalization patterns. However,
Broder and colleagues found a similar number of annual office visits
for CSU (3.4 vs 3.3 in ASSURE-CSU). Moreover, in ASSURE-CSU,
CSU-related out-of-pocket expenses to patients averaged nearly
PPP$500 per year and approached PPP$1000 in Canada. As
patients in our study were still symptomatic despite treatment, many
sought alternative medical therapies, which are generally not covered by country health insurances. In addition, CSU considerably
affected productivity, such that one in five patients took time off
from work and one in four experienced reduced productivity at
work. These findings are comparable with work productivity impair

and severe psoria
The reasons for ED visits and hospitalizations may center on
patient and physician awareness and education. Depending on the
healthcare system in a country, the use of this high-cost care could
be due to an inaccessibility of primary- or secondary-care physicians
for flare-ups and steroid prescriptions. Alternatively, patients who
have been treated in the ED before may feel that it is where CSU
should be treated, or they may receive secondary gain from this visit,

such as sick leave. In certain circumstances, hospitalization may be

used for observation or to manage angioedema when anaphylaxis is
feared by inexperienced ED physicians or because of delays in specialist referral.

Treatment modalities reported included therapies recommended
in the current guidelines during the study period. However, patients
were not always treated along formal guideline recommendations:
For example, sedating first-generation H,-antihistamines, intravenous
immunoglobulin, and long-term oral corticosteroids were not uncommon. These results suggest that, at the time of study, some providers may have had insufficient resources or knowledge in treating
patients with CSU. They may have resorted to trial-and-error
approaches with therapies that carry significant side-effect risks and
lack efficacy evidence,” particularly when treating patients refractory
to standard licensed therapy. Moreover, the monoclonal antibody
omalizumab was included in the urticaria treatment guidelines in
2013? and was approved for inadequately controlled CSU in 2014.
However, omalizumab had not yet launched in the study countries
during data collection, and few patients (<6%) in this study were
treated with it. Future research should explore how disease burden
and outcomes in CSU are affected by the introduction of omalizumab, its inclusion in the clinical guidelines, and its uptake in clinical

practice.

While the study used a systematic patient selection method, a
similar approach was not possible for physician and center selection
due to the small number of specialist units for this population. Centers were selected to achieve variation in location, specialty, size,
and type, but the resulting sample is not guaranteed to be representative of all centers and physicians treating patients with CSU. Likewise, inclusion criteria required patients to be symptomatic despite
treatment and thus, the study does not reflect the entire population
of patients with CSU.

Data and information about symptoms, HRQoL, and out-ofpocket expenses collected in the patient survey may have been subject to recall bias. The recall period for validated PROs varied from
7 days for the DLQI to 4 weeks for the AE-QoL and for the patient
medical resource survey was limited to 3 months to minimize the
potential for such bias. While there was some heterogeneity across
countries, results were strikingly similar particularly with respect to
HRQoL.

Additional research is needed to explore patient characteristics,
given that most patients in ASSURE-CSU were Caucasian and (consistent with previous findings***°) female, as well as patterns relating to disease activity and duration of disease. Because of the
inherent fluctuations in CSU activity, longer or repeated assessments
would help confirm the results. The impact of CSU on work performance and productivity warrants additional evaluation. Our findings
suggest that there may be inadequate knowledge among medical
staff of the appropriate workup for CSU, and there is a need to
increase awareness of the economic and humanistic impact of
CSU among primary- and secondary-care providers and society in

general.

5 | CONCLUSIONS

Chronic spontaneous urticaria is a chronic, disabling disease with little
previous research that is challenging to treat adequately. The humanistic and economic burden of CSU has been underestimated. There is
considerable delay in diagnosis and specialist referral, and there is inadequate knowledge among medical staff in primary and secondary care
about CSU. Incorrect treatment patterns have been identified, and the
high cost of unnecessary investigations and treatments is due to poor
compliance with guidelines and best practices. Additional analyses
should explore these findings in detail. To address unmet needs in CSU,
it will be important to promote treatment guidelines and evidence
based practices among healthcare providers.
