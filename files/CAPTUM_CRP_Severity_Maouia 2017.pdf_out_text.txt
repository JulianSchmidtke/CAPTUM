Abstract

Background: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common dermatological condition defined by
the sudden occurrence of daily wheals and pruritus for at least 6 weeks. Multifactorial origin is
suggested such as Oxidative stress. This latter may play a double role as a trigger and remnant agent.
Objectives: The first aim of this study is to investigate antioxidant status, inflammatory proteins,
hematologic counts and clinical assessment in CSU patients. The second aim is to evaluate the effect
of a first-line treatment: Desloratadine 5mg/day on these different parameters.

Patients and Methods: This study enrolled 30 CSU patients and same number of controls. We assessed
the Urticaria Activity Score (UAS), Total antioxidant status (TAS), glutathione S-Transferase (GST),
Superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), Catalase (CAT), Albumin, Alpha
1, alpha2, betal beta2, gamma globulins, CRP and hematologic numeration.

Results: At baseline Alphal, alpha2, betal, beta2, gamma globulins, CRP, SOD activity, leukocytes
and basophils were significantly higher in patients versus controls (p<0.05). TAS)GST, CAT, GPx
and albumin were significantly low in patients versus controls (p<0.05). Afterjtreatment, TAS, GST
and GPx were significantly increased in patients versus patients before treatment (p<0.001). SOD,
alphal, alpha2, betal, beta2, gamma globulins, CRP, albuminy leukocytes and basophils were
significantly decreased after treatment versus before treatmenta(p<0.05). A significant correlation
between CRP and UAS (r=0.3; p=0.011) was noted. UAS assessment revealed the efficacy of 30 daysantihistaminic treatment. Conclusion: Desloratadine exertedyanti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects
on CSU patients revealed by CRP. Patients’ reémissiony was synergistic to CRP attenuation
emphasizing CRP relevance for CSU clinical assessment.

Keywords: Chronic spontaneous urticaria; oxidative stress, inflam-mation, Desloratadine.
Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common skin condition characterized by the
sudden appearance of wheals and/or angioedema, defining wheals as a cutaneous swelling of
variable size for at least 6 weeks [1]. Despite the extensive search for underlying causes or
triggering factors, the aetiology of chronic urticaria remains unclear in at least 80-90% of
patients; therefore, it was referred to spontaneous [2].

CSU affects nearly 3% of the population in the USA and Europe and accounts for
nearly 75% of all chronic urticaria cases [3, 4] in both countries. CSU can significantly impair
the quality of life [5]. Notably, CSU patients report symptoms that may last for several years
[6]. This condition has been associated with significant psychosocial |and physical
impairment; resulting in substantial disability and diminished/productiyity. Patients report
emotional distress, social isolation and lethargy [7].

The majority of skin irritants triggers reactive oxidant species generation through
metabolic pathway activation [8]. Moreover,an»CSU patients, inflammation consequent to
mast cell degranulation may lead to,am increased oxidant stress status and decreased
antioxidant capacities [9]. Actually, oxidant stress and inflammatory pathways share in
common several molecular actorsy Essentially, CSU generates diverse changes in the
endocrine-immune system function, coagulation/fibrinolytic activity, and metabolic
processes. C-reactivesprotein (CRP) reveals CSU activity promoting secretion of
inflammatory \mediators [10]. CRP is involved in leukocyte activity enhancement,
complement fixation, modulation of platelet activation, and clearance of cellular debris from
sites of active inflammation [11].

Numerous factors, including mast cell activation, increased vascular permeability
mediator release, lead to wheals appearance. Histamine is the most known mediator. Its role

in the pathophysiology of CSU is well-established [12]. Antihistamines are the first-line
treatment for CSU. Desloratadine is a selective Hl-receptor antagonist with a favorable
pharmacokinetic profile [13] and proven efficacy in randomized, controlled clinical trials
[14]. Current practice guidelines for the management of CSU describe an approach with nonsedating H1 oral antihistamines as the initial agents. Besides, in vitro it has been demonstrated
that desloratadine has an antioxidant activity [15].

In this context, we attended to investigate the effect of desloratadine 5mg once day
during 30 days on clinical data, antioxidant status, inflammatory parameters and hematologic
markers in CSU patients. We also aimed to investigate CRP relevance in CSU clinical
assessment.

Patients and methods
Population study
This cross-sectional study included 30 patients of~CSU attending the dermatology

outpatient department of Fattouma Bourguiba hospital of Monastir in Tunisia and 30 controls,

 

age and gender matched. Patients' mean age was 36,9 + 12.32 years ranged from 20 to 60

 

years. Controls mean age was 36.1 + 10:48 years ranged from 21 to 56 years. A detailed
history and clinical examination were recorded for each patient. The diagnosis is defined as
urticarial skin lesions occurring intermittently or continuously for more than 6 weeks. We
excluded from this study, patients having any subtype of CU (physical and cholinergic
urticarias, urticarial yvasculitis, hereditary Angio-oedema: inducible urticaria) and those
receiving immunosuppressive therapy for the last four weeks. Patients were disrupted from H,
and Hp antihistamines for 10 days prior to the study. They were given desloratadine 5 mg/day
for 30 days. We assessed a first check up before treatment and a second one after one month

of treatment.
Simple preparation

Venous blood was drawn into simple, EDTA and heparin of lithium tubes. Whole
blood was separated by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 10 min at 4°C). The samples were
separated and stored at -20 °C until use. EDTA serum aliquots were objected to hematologic
measurements. Heparin of lithium serum aliquots were objected to TAS evaluation. Simple
tube serum aliquots were employed to antioxidant enzymes and protein electrophoresis.
Clinical and biological study
Urticaria Activity Score

Urticaria Activity Score (UAS) is frequently used in routine clinical practice to
evaluate chronic urticaria severity and treatment efficacy. The EAA@I/GA2LEN/EDF/WAO
guideline recommends the use of a straightforward and well established symptom UAS [16].
Its values depend on the number of wheals (0-3 points)sand theyintensity of pruritus (0-3
points). In this study, UAS was assessed according to the mean number of wheals and severity
of itching, which had appeared during a week,before blood sampling. We estimated UAS for
CSU patients before and after desloratadine,Smg/day for 30 days treatment.
Total antioxidant status

Total antioxidant stress (TAS) of heparinized plasma was measured using colorimetric
method, which is based“on the bleaching of the characteristic color of a more stable ABTS
(2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylb€nzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] radical action by antioxidants [17].
TAS concentrations were performed using commercial tests (Randox Laboratories, UK,
Antrium).
Gluthatione-S-transferase activity

Gluthatione S-transferase (GST) activity of heparinized plasma was determined using
spectrophotometer following to the method of Habig et al. [18]. One mM 1-chloro-2,4
dinitrobenzene (CDNB) was added to potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.5 containing 1 mM
GSH 1% absolute ethanol, the change in absorbance at 340 nm was measured in function of
time. Results were expressed as 14M of GSH-CDNB conjugate formed/min/ml.

Superoxide dismutase activity

Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in erythrocytes was measured according to procedure by
Asada et al. [19] Nitroblue tetrazolium salt (NBT), a superoxide radical scavenger, is reduced
by superoxide to form blue formazan whose absorption was measured at 560 nm. One unit of
SOD is defined as the amount of enzyme required to give 50% inhibition of the NBT
reduction reaction compared with enzyme control. The SOD activity was expressed in U/mg
protein.

Glutathione peroxidase activity

Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in erythrocytes was “measufed according to
spectrophotometric procedure by Paglia [20]. One milliliter of 50 mM phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) containing 5 mM of ethylenediaminétetraacetic acid (EDTA), 2 mM of
reduced a-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotidesphosphatey(NADPH), 20 mM of glutathione
(GSH), 10 mM of sodium azide (NaN3), ‘and 23 mU of oxidized glutathione (GSSG)
reductase was incubated at 37°C for 5 min. Twenty 11 of H2O2 solution (0.25 mM) and 10 pl
of sample were added to the assay mixture. A change in absorbance at 340 nm was monitored
for 1 min. The specific activity was calculated as the millimoles of NADPH consumed /min
/mg of protein (U/mg,protein).

Catalase activity

Catalase (CAT) activity in erythrocytes was determined according to spectrophotometric
procedure by Aebi’s method [21]. CAT activity was measured at 25 °C by recording H202
decomposition at 240 nm. The amount of H,O0, converted into H,O and % O; in | min under

standard conditions is accepted as the enzyme reaction rate.
Inflammatory protein measurements

Albumin, alphal, alpha2, betal, beta2 and gamma globulins were determined in the
serum by capillary electrophoresis [22] on Konélab 201 ™ (Thermo Electron Corporation)
and were analyzed using a software Capillarys ™ (Serbia). CRP was measured using an
immunoturbidimetric method (Konélab 30™) [23].
Hematology quantifications

Hematological analysis were performed using an automated cell counter and
hemoglobin was carried out by electrophoresis and liquid chromatography [24]. These
parameters were measured by Beckman Coulter, Coulter GENS and_Coulter LH 750
Analyzers.
Statistical analysis
SPSS version 20.0 was used to explore our results. Student?s t-test_and correlation test were
used for the Means comparison test. p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Ethics
The study protocol, patient informationmsheet and consent form were approved by the
Institutional Ethics Committee of the\Dermatology Department of Fattouma Bourguiba
Hospital of Monastir-Tunisia. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.
Results

A total of 30s@SU) patients were enrolled in the study based on the clinical and
biological asséssments. Table 1 summarizes the study population features.

UAS assessment revealed the efficacy of 30 days antihistaminic treatment by 54.5%
reduction in wheals sizes and 63.6 % reduction in itching severity (Table 2).

At baseline, patients were characterized by significant lower levels of TAS, GST
activity, CAT activity, GPx activity and albumin when compared to controls (p<0.05, Table

3). Besides, at baseline, patients exhibited significant higher SOD activity, alphal, alpha2,
betal, beta2, gamma globulins and CRP as compared with controls (p<0.05). After treatment,
TAS, GST activity and GPx activity were significantly increased in patients compared to
those before treatment (p<0.001). Unexpectedly, there was a significant attenuation of SOD
activity after treatment which remained significantly higher than controls. However, CAT
activity did not change after treatment. In addition, total serum globulin, albumin and CRP
concentrations were significantly reduced in patients after treatment compared to those before
treatment (p< 0.001).

Before treatment, leukocytes and basophils counts were significantly higher in CSU
patients compared to controls (p<0.05) (Table 4). After treatment, leukocytes and basophils
were significantly decreased in CSU patients compared to those before\treatment (p<0.05).
However, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils? hemoglobin and_ platelets
showed no changes between different groups.

CRP which has been characterized as a potential biomarker of the disease severity was
significantly correlated with UAS (r=0.3, p=0:011)..Surprisingly, no significant correlation
between antioxidant parameters and UASawas revealed despite patients’ remission.
Discussion

We noted that patients' agesyranged from 20 to 60 years. Literature cites that CSU
occurs across all age groups largely in young women between 20 and 40 years of age [7].

One of the mostimportant aspects of this study is the assessment of UAS in order to
appraise disease remission and patient's quality of life after desloratadine 5 mg daily
treatment. UAS) assessment reflected the efficacy of 30 days antihistaminic treatment by
54.5% reduction in wheals sizes and 63.6% reduction in itching severity. However UAS is
largely criticized since it relies on subjective description and may not be so accurate and
quantitative [5]. Previous studies, found that, the current standard of care, H\-antihistamines

at licensed doses, is only effective at resolving symptoms in less than 50 % of patients with
CSU [13]. According to these studies, further increases in Hj-antihistamine doses did not
improve treatment response [25]. Antihistamines, guidelines recommend the addition of a
third-line treatment option of omalizumab, ciclosporin or montelukast [1].

The relevant low TAS, CAT activity, GPx activity and GST activity in patients at
baseline compared to controls may suggest the involvement of oxidative stress in CSU
pathogenesis. The diminished patients’ antioxidant capacities at baseline are likely to be a
consequence of a prolonged reactive oxygen species generation due to chronic inflammation.
Previous findings suggest the involvement of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of CSU [26,
27]. In this study, antioxidant capacities increased synergistically with patient’s remission
revealed by UAS and personal patients’ lifestyle report. However, no significant correlation
between TAS and UAS parameters was observed. This may showthat desloratadine exerts
anti-inflammatory effects that attenuate oxidant reactions. ‘Desloratadine antioxidant
capacities ought not due to its formula which contains two conjugated cycles. In our analysis,
erythrocyte SOD activity was significantly higher in CSU patients before treatment. After
treatment, SOD activity was significantly, attenuated but always significantly higher than
controls. Cassano et al. found that before treatment radical oxygen species concentrations and
SOD activity were significantly elevated in patients with CSU as compared with controls.
Treatment with desloratadineycaused a relevant reduction of radical oxygen species levels and
SOD activity [28]edn contrast, previous investigations described that desloratadine
significantly enhanced SOD activity [15].

This study was performed to evaluate the effect of desloratadine on positive
inflammatory proteins (alphal, alpha2, betal globulins and CRP). The high levels of alphal,
alpha2, betal, beta2, gamma globulins and CRP in CSU patients at baseline indicated
inflammatory events booting the disease burden. After treatment, we noted significant

reduction of these inflammatory markers associated with patients’ health improvement. The
linear correlation between CRP and UAS noted in our investigation clearly shows the
relevance of CRP as biomarker in patients’ follow-up. Similar findings were reported [29,
30]. On the contrary, Lin et al., found that CRP levels were negatively correlated with the
extent of erythema in urticaria [31]. In fact, CRP exerts immunoregulatory functions
including enhancement of leukocyte activity, modulation of platelet activation, and clearance
of cellular debris from sites of active inflammation [11]. Similar results were found by
Ohtsuka [32]. The latter established an elevated CRP levels in CSU patients before the start of
therapy [32]. The same study ascertained that CSU patients with elevated sensitivityCRP showed better responses to oral cyclosporine therapy than CSU patients with decreased
sensitivity-CRP [32]. A previous study showed that plasma fibrin degradation products, ddimer and CRP markers in patients with chronic urticaria were well correlated with each other
and significantly associated with disease severity [33]. Levels of all these parameters reduced
as their disease condition improved, while they increased when the disease became
aggravated [33]. In our study, a statistically significant decrease of albumin was observed in
CSU patients (p<0.001). Our study confixmed previous finding that indicated significantly
lower albumin and significantly higher,CRP were achieved in CSU patients than controls
[34].

In our study, leukocytes and basophils counts were high in CSU patients at baseline
then decreased aftemtfeatment. Ohtsuka found that leukocytes and basophils counts in
elevated high \sensitivity-CRP patients were significantly increased than those in patients
showing no elevation of high sensitivity-CRP [32]. A previous study suggested that CSU can
be identified as a mast cell- and basophil-dependent inflammatory disorder of the skin
accompanied by an acute phase response [35].

Further to literature, CSU onset is initiated by inappropriate activation and degranulation of

dermal mast cells. The latter progress to complex pool of varied proinflammatory cytokine
release and inflammatory mechanisms such as cellular infiltration evolving into lymphocyte
and granulocyte. These cells, in turn, release more proinflammatory mediators that recruit and
activate other cell types such as leukocytes and basophils, thereby amplifying and extending
the cell response [11]. Unexpectedly, we found that platelet number was reduced in patients
before and after treatment compared to controls. In fact, platelets are activated during
inflammatory processes and are involved in modulating inflammatory and immune response
via various mediator releases. Kasperska-Zajac et al. found that in contrast
to CSU, chronic urticaria patients with a positive response to autologous serum skin testing
associated with increased secretion of platelet chemokines [36].

Conclusion

Desloratadine exerted anti-inflammatory effects on CSU patients wevealed by CRP, alpha,
beta globulins and immune cells attenuation after Smg/day, for 30 days of treatment. This
progress was associated with antioxidant capacityyimprovement. Taken together, oxidant
stress may not be an aetiologic factor triggering*©SU, pathogenesis rather than a consequence
of an ongoing process. Patients’ remission was synergistic to CRP attenuation emphasizing

CRP relevance for CSU clinical assessment.
