ABSTRACT

 

Background. Eosinophil granulocytes and eosinophilic granule proteins are deposited in the skin lesions of AD patients. Increased Th2 activity in the acute phase of AD is associated with IL-5 expression
and results in enhanced eosinophilopoiesis, eosinophilic activation, and chemotaxis.

Material and methods. Thirty AD patients attending the Allergic Diseases Diagnostic Center and hospitalized in the Department of Dermatology were examined. Two control groups were included: 30 patients suffering from chronic urticaria and 30 healthy individuals without any symptoms of allergic diseases. Laboratory tests included the number of eosinophils expressed as a percentage of a differential
white blood cell count, the absolute number of eosinophils in mm? (Carpentier’s eosin method), and an
evaluation of antigen-specific IgE (aslgE) in serum using fluoroenzyme immunoassay (CAP System FEIA,
Pharmacia).

Results. The number of eosinophils/mm* in the peripheral blood was 290.0 + 205.7 in AD patients, and
113.3 + 93.7 and 153.3 + 113.7 in the two control groups; the difference was statistically significant.
Patients with severe AD had higher eosinophilia than patients with mild to moderate AD, but the difference was not significant. In AD patients with positive SPT tests and detectable specific IgE in serum,
and also in patients with symptoms of other atopic diseases, the peripheral blood eosinophilia was more
prominent compared to patients with negative SPTs and without symptoms of other atopic diseases.

Conclusion. The results point to the role of eosinophils in etiopathogenesis of AD. Peripheral blood
eosinophilia could serve as a diagnostic parameter in differentiating allergic AD from non-allergic AD.

 

Introduction

AD is a chronic, relapsing skin disease, usually be- distress and sleep disturbances (1-3). AD patients are
ginning in early childhood. The clinical manifestations genetically predisposed to increased synthesis of IgE
and locations of skin lesions depend on age, but the antibodies specific for airborne and food allergens (4).
main symptom are intense pruritus, causing emotional Eosinophil participation in etiopathogenesis of AD

is still discussed. Th2 derived IL-5 induces formation,
activation, and chemotaxis of eosinophils. The importance of IL-5 for the generation of eosinophils is evident from studies in IL-5—deficient mice, which are unable to develop eosinophilia upon allergic sensitization
and challenge (5). IL-3 and GM-CSF have also been
shown to induce eosinophil production in the bone marrow. Eosinophils generate leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4,
LTE4) that amplify the inflammatory cascade, probably
by acting as chemotactic factors or by triggering the
release of cytotoxic proteins (6).

According to some authors (7), eosinophil degranulation takes place directly within skin lesions. On the
other hand, Karawajczyk et al. (8) suggest that it could
occur in the blood, in the bone marrow, or both. After
degranulation, a striking extracellular deposition of substances such as eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN),
eosinophil cation protein (ECP), or major basic proteins
(MBP) appear in AD lesions. An elevation of granule
protein levels in peripheral blood correlating with disease activity can be observed. Moreover, in the IgEmediated late-phase reaction, extracellular eosinophil
granule protein deposition corresponds to electronmicroscopic observations revealing disruption of eosinophils and free granules in the tissue (7).

Eosinophils also modulate allergic inflammation (6).
They are likely to either augment or maintain the Th2
allergic response, particularly IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-9,
IL-10, IL-16, GM-CSF, eotaxin, and RANTES. IL-12 promotes a switch from a Th2 to Thl immune response
commonly seen at chronic stages of AD (6). According
to some authors, this correlates well with disease severity, while others consider it a rather variable parameter (9). The data on increased peripheral blood eosinophilia in patients suffering from AD and concomitant respiratory symptoms are scarce.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the
correlation of peripheral blood eosinophilia in AD patients with the clinical severity of the disease and atopy.

 

 

Material and methods

Thirty AD patients from 8 to 60 years old (mean 24.5
years), 22 females and 8 males, diagnosed by the Hanifin
and Rajka criteria (10), were included in the study. Fifteen patients expressed additional manifestations: atopic
asthma (4 patients), allergic rhinitis (11 patients), and allergic conjunctivitis (12 patients). Based on the clinical
evaluation of AD patients, two subgroups were selected:
subgroup I: 17 AD patients, W-AZS value < 50 points (mild

and moderate AD) and subgroup II: 13 AD patients, WAZS value 2 50 points (severe and very severe AD).

The two control groups included 30 patients suffering from chronic urticaria (group A) and 30 healthy individuals (group B); they matched the AD group in age
and gender. Detailed disease histories were obtained,
regarding the onset and course of AD, factors exacerbating inflammation, disease activity, and further atopic
symptoms, as well as the family history of atopy.

Clinical evaluation of AD patients was based on the
W-AZS index as proposed by Silny (11), which grades
the severity of pruritus, sleep disturbances, and the extent and severity of skin inflammation. The W-AZS is a
relatively objective clinical scoring system for AD patients. It evaluates both objective and subjective criteria during all phases of the disease, describes involvement of skin regions, and allows monitoring of the
course of the disease (12). In the chronic urticaria patients, both the skin lesions and severity of pruritus were
evaluated, using criteria proposed by Lorette (13) and
Thomson (14).

SPTs were performed in the group of patients with
AD and in control group B, using the set of airborne
allergens by Nexter/Allergopharma (grass pollen, tree
pollen, weed pollen, feathers, animal dander, molds,
and house dust mites (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus
and D. farinae). The serum level of antigen-specific IgE
(asIgE) was assayed using the fluoroenzyme immunoassay (CAP System FEIA, Pharmacia) in selected AD patients. In control group A, SPTs were performed only if
the history suggested the possible involvement of airborne allergens. Histamine hydrochloride (1:1000) was
used as a positive control and 0.9% saline solution as a
negative control. A positive SPT result (+++) was considered if the wheal corresponded to the mean diameter of the histamine wheal (15).

Laboratory tests included differential white blood
cell count with eosinophils expressed as percentages
and the absolute eosinophil count in mm of peripheral
blood (16).

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee
of the University of Medical Sciences in Poznan (statement number 502/03).

 

 

 

Statistical analysis

For numeric variables, descriptive statistics were
reported as mean + standard deviation. Statistical evaluations were performed using ANOVA analysis with
post-hoc Newman-Keuls tests. To assess correlations,
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was calculated.

 

‘In order to construct a ROC curve, the sensitivity and specificity of the test must be calculated for each possible cut-point value. The X-axis
is 1 minus the specificity and the Y-axis is the sensitivity. An index of the adequacy of the test is the area under the curve; a perfect test has

an area of 1.0, and a nondiscriminating test has an area of 0.5.

Number of eosinophils in mm’ of blood

Figure 1: Positive correlation between the number of
peripheral blood eosinophils evaluated by eosin method of
Carpentier and the percentage of eosinophils in the

differential white-blood-cell count in AD patients.

The ability of measured parameters to discriminate between AD patients and healthy individuals was evaluated using ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic)
curves.' Statistical analysis was carried out with STATISTICA v. 6.0 and Instat v. 3.0 by GrafPad.

Results

SPTs were positive in 80.8% of AD patients; house
dust mites and grass pollen allergens prevailed. Seventy-two percent of the patients were sensitized to
multiple allergens (polyvalent allergy) and 28% were
sensitized to only one group of allergens (monovalent
allergy). In control group B, the SPTs were positive in
26.7%, with the majority sensitized to grass pollen; 25%

of these were sensitized to multiple allergens and 75% to only one tested allergen.

The mean absolute eosinophil
count was 290.0 + 205.7 eosinophils/
mm+*in AD patients, 113.3 + 93.7 eosinophils/mm+% in control group A, and
153.3 + 113.7 eosinophils/mm* in control group B. Statistical analysis revealed
a significant difference with p < 0.001
for group A and p < 0.05 for group B.
The eosinophil percentage in AD pa
 

bs tients was 6.3 + 5.6%, in control group
A 2.2 + 1.9%, and in control group B

3.2 + 2.8%. The difference between AD

=e patients and control group A was sta
tistically significant (p < 0.01), but not
with respect to control group B (Table
1).

In the group of patients suffering
from AD, the number of eosinophils
correlated significantly with the percentage of eosinophils in the differential blood cell count (Figure 1).

There was no statistically significant
difference between mean eosinophil numbers in the
subgroup with mild and moderate AD (288 + 196.4),
and the subgroup with severe AD with 292.3 + 225.3
eosinophils/mm‘. Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference between the mean eosinophil percentage in the differential white cell count: 5.3 + 4.4%
in subgroup I, and 7.7 + 6.9% in subgroup II.

The mean absolute eosinophil count in AD patients
with symptoms of other atopic diseases was 293.3 +
205.2 eosinophils/mm$ and exceeded the number of
eosinophils in AD patients without symptoms, which
was 286.7 + 213.3; the difference was not statistically
significant. The mean eosinophil percentage in AD patients with additional atopic manifestations was higher
than in group without further signs of atopy: 7.3 + 6.4%
and 5.3 + 4.7%, respectively, but this was not statistically significant.

Figure 2: ROC curve analysis of peripheral
blood eosinophilia by Carpentier’s eosin metod
and by differential white-blood-cell count in AD
patients and in healthy controls.

In AD patients with positive SPTs and detectable
serum IgE, the mean absolute eosinophil count was
higher than in patients with a negative SPT, but the difference was not statistically significant: they showed
316.0 + 213.5 and 160.0 + 89.4 eosinophils/mm‘, respectively. Nor did the mean eosinophil count differ
significantly.

In order to evaluate the predictability of the measured parameters for distinguishing AD patients from
healthy persons, an ROC curve analysis was performed.
The area under the curve value for peripheral blood
eosinophilia determined using the absolute eosinophil
count was 0.678, and for the eosinophil percentage in
the differential white blood cell count the value obtained
was 0.681 (Figure 2). Both achieved values were statistically significantly different from the border value of
the non-discriminating test (0.5).

Discussion

According to some authors (17, 18), there is a positive correlation between the number of eosinophils in

peripheral blood and disease severity, whereas others
have not observed such a relationship (19, 20). Some
researchers regard peripheral blood eosinophilia as a
more reliable marker of clinical improvement compared
to levels of selected eosinophilic proteins (21). According to Toma et al. (22), infants suffering from severe
AD reveal impaired growth, developmental delay, a low
serum albumin level, and electrolyte disturbances, and
have significantly higher number of eosinophils and
eosinophilic nuclear lobes, platelets, and total serum
IgE level.

A distinct increase of eosinophils in peripheral blood
(> 500/mm*) was seen in only 6 AD patients, whereas
an elevated eosinophil percentage in the differentia:
white blood cell count (> 4%) was determined in 14
patients (46.6%). According to Yamamoto et al. (23),
the IL-5 gene may play a role in blood eosinophilia associated with AD.

According to Uehara et al. (9), patients with severe
AD and a personal history of respiratory symptoms
show a significantly higher incidence of blood eosinophilia than patients suffering from mild AD with only
skin lesions. On the other hand, Wiitrich et al. (24) and
Kang et al. (25) found no difference in the blood eosinophil counts between patients with AD and concomitant atopic diseases compared to subjects with pure AD.
It is worth emphasizing that, of accompanying atopic
manifestations, allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis
prevailed, while asthma was present in only four cases.
Our results suggest that in AD patients with other symptoms of atopy, even with allergic conjunctivitis, an increased number of peripheral blood eosinophils may
be expected.

There are only a few reports comparing eosinophilia
in non-allergic (intrinsic) and allergic (extrinsic) AD. Rho
(26) concluded through immunophenotyping that there
were more prominent dermal infiltrates with eosinophils as well as eotaxin immunoreactivity in the extrinsic AD. We made a similar observation in the peripheral blood by assessing eosinophilia in patients with
both types of AD.

The evaluation that was performed using ROC
curves to assess the value of both the total eosinophil
count and the percentage of eosinophils in order to distinguish AD patients from healthy persons revealed a
statistically significant difference between the area under the curve and the border value of 0.5. The area under
the curve was slightly higher if the differential white
cell count was applied (0.681), as compared to using
the absolute eosinophil count (0.678).
