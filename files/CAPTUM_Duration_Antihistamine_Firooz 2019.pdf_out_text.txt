Real Life Management of Chronic Urticaria: multicenter and cross sectional study on
patients and dermatologists in Iran

Recently, advances in understanding the etiology of urticaria and updates of diagnostic and
therapeutic management guidelines have drawn attention to chronic urticaria (CU) morbidity.
This study aimed to evaluate Iranian dermatologists’ practice and real life management of CU
patients. A total of 35 dermatologists and 443 patients were included in the study. Number of
female patients was 321 (72.5%). Mean (Standard Deviation) age of the study patients was 38
(13) years and the median (Inter Quartile Range) of disease duration was 12 (6- 48) months.
Severity of patients’ symptoms was mild for 32.1%, moderate for 38.7%, severe for18.8% and
10.4% of them had no evident signs or symptoms. The most common diagnostic methods were
physical examination (96.6%), differential blood count (83.5%), erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(77.4%), and C-reactive protein (62.8%). The number of dermatologists prescribed non-sedating
antihistamines (nsAH) in regular dose and high dose mono therapy were 26 (74%) and 6 (17%),

respectively. About 66% of dermatologists were familiar with British Association of

Dermatologists (BAD) guideline. The most common first-line treatment for CU by Iranian
6 piertiag was non-sedating antihistamines in regular or high doses. The real-life

management of patients with CU in Iran was in accordance with the available practice
guidelines.

Introduction

Urticaria is a skin disease characterized by wheals, angioedema, or both(Zuberbier, Aberer et al.
2014; Weller, Zuberbier et al. 2015; Zuberbier, Aberer et al. 2018).Acute and chronic forms of
urticaria are distinguished based on disease duration, and categorized as “acute” (< 6 weeks) or
“chronic” (> 6 weeks). Among patients with chronic urticaria (CU), less than 40% can have
os accompanying episodes of angioedema(Ojeda, Vanegas et al. 2018). The lifetime prevalence for
any subtype of urticaria is estimated to be 15—23%, meaning that almost every fifth person is
affected by urticaria in his or her lifetime(Weller, Viehmann et al. 2013).
Although CU is not life-threatening, its impact can be substantial with regard to disability,
decreasing in the quality of life (QoL), psychological and emotional distress, and productivity
losses(Sussman, Hébert et al. 2014).In addition, CU has been shown to cause high direct and
indirect healthcare costs and could impose a substantial economic burden to health care system
and patients(DeLong, Culler et al. 2008).
CU is difficult to treat in many patients(Termeer, Staubach et al. 2015) and common therapeutic
goals are a reduction in disease activity, symptoms control, and improvement in QoL(Lima,
Gooderham et al. 2017).Several guidelines have been published for the definition, classification,
diagnosis and management of CU (Grattan and Humphreys 2007; Powell, Du Toit et al. 2007;
Zuberbier, Asero et al. 2009; Bernstein, Lang et al. 2014; Zuberbier, Aberer et al. 2014; Powell,

ted Artic

Leech et al. 2015). A national guideline on the diagnosis and treatment has also been recently
developed by Iranian Society of dermatology(Zahra Hallaji, Alireza Khatami et al. 2015). These
guidelines aim to standardize the diagnostic and therapeutic management of CU and minimize
the differences in management between different practitioners(Wu, Ardern-Jones et al. 2015).

Second generation non-sedating antihistamines (nsAH) at standard dose and up-dosing are

cep

recommended as the first-line and second line treatment, respectively, in all of the existing CU
(oS) guidelines (Grattan and Humphreys 2007; Bernstein, Lang et al. 2014; Zuberbier, Aberer et al.

2014; Powell, Leech et al. 2015). Combination of nsAH with other drugs, such as H2

antihistamines, sedating antihistamines at night or leukotriene inhibitors, can be useful for

resistant cases(Grattan and Humphreys 2007).

However, the treatment of CU can be unsatisfactory for both patients and physicians, because

the lesions may persist, despite the use of existing treatments(Gimenez-Arnau, Ferrer et al.

2017). The lack of studies on real life management of CU in Iran and also physician compliance

with guidelines resulted in developing this study. Specifically, this study aimed to determine

knowledge of Iranian dermatologists about existing guidelines for CU management.

Methods

Study design and participants

This multicenter and cross-sectional study was done on the sample of CU patients and

dermatologists in Iran. First patient in and last patient out was from August 2016 to April 2017.

Selection of dermatologists

Selection of dermatologists followed a random process. A master list of Iranian dermatologists,
including both private and public practitioners was prepared. A stratified random sampling
method over the country was used to ensure that the participating dermatologists are
representatives of the dermatologists who manage CU throughout Iran. Afterwards, each preselected dermatologist was contacted to find out if he/she is able to recruit potentially at least two
patients with CU per month and if he/she wants to participate in the study. If the abovementioned criteria were met, then he/she was invited to participate in the study, if not, another
pre-selected dermatologist was contacted until the required number of dermatologists were

obtained. Each selected dermatologist included consecutive patients who met inclusion criteria.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria of patients

Male or female adults (aged18 years and above) with short-lived itchy wheals, angioedema or
both together, with 6 weeks or more of continuous activity, diagnosed by a dermatologist as
chronic urticaria based on the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) guideline, were
included. Exclusion criteria were current participation in any clinical trial and inability to
complete patient’s questionnaire. Patients were fully informed about the survey and were asked
to sign the informed consent form. If the first patient did not fulfill the eligibility criteria or was
unwilling to participate, the investigator was pursued with the next patient until enrolment of at

least one patient per consulting session was achieved. The recruitment period was 8 months and

the patients were enrolled consecutively if they met eligibility criteria. This consecutive

recruitment helped to limit bias related to physician-led patient selection.

Data collection and sample size

Data were collected through 3 different tools, namely "Investigator’s Questionnaire", "Case
Report Form" and "Patient’s self-reported Questionnaire".

Data on the demographic, medical history, diagnostic method, and treatment regimen, patient’s
compliance with treatments, and QoL of CU patients were collected through "Case Report Form"
by dermatologist and "Patient’s self-reported Questionnaire". Dermatologist points of view on
the CU diagnostic methods, treatments efficacy and safety and patients’ compliance with
treatment was studied through "Investigator’s Questionnaire". Also, dermatologist knowledge
about the CU management guidelines and methods for guidelines awareness was evaluated by

"Investigator’s Questionnaire".

Finally, 443 patients and 35 dermatologists were recruited in this study. All 35 centers were
located in the different urban areas, all over the country. Thirty out of thirty five centers,
recruited 13 patients. Minimum and maximum recruited number of patients in these centers was

5 and 16, respectively

‘Monitoring and quality control

The study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and Good Epidemiology
Practice principles. Data quality control performed at site level by Clinical Research Associates
(CRA).

Statistical approach

The data were reported as descriptive and no statistical test with significance was planned. The
quantitative variables were reported using non-missing number, mean, Standard Deviation (SD),
median (Inter Quartile Range), minimum, and maximum. Non-missing number and proportion

were used for description of categorical variables.

The study was approved by Ethics committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences.
Ethics committee approval code is IR.TUMS.REC.1394.1768.

Results

Participant characteristics

A total of 443 patients with chronic urticaria were included by 35 dermatologists over different
sites of Iran. About 72% of the patients were female. The mean (SD) age for female patients and
male was 37.5(+12.8) and 38.9 (+13.7) years, respectively. The median (Inter Quartile Range) of
disease duration was 12 years (6- 48).

The workplace of the dermatologists was “mostly public practice setting” in 29%, “mostly

private practice setting” in 26%, and “mixed public and private practice setting” in 45%.

Three most common relevant medical history was allergy (25.91%), dermatological (24.21%)

and gastrointestinal (20.59%). Also, frequency (%) of former current smoker was 30 (6.9%) and

CO _irsnens of key symptoms for CU patients, alone or in combination with other symptoms, was
25 (95.6%) for wheals, 404 (91.2%) for itching, and 158 (35.7%) for angioedema. Also, some
patients had combination of two or three key symptoms: 263 (91.2%) had combination of wheals
2S) and itching, and 148 (33.4%) all three above mentioned symptoms.
All 35 dermatologists mentioned wheals as the key symptom for CU diagnosis. Although,
(@) 28(80%) and 17(49%) of dermatologists reported itching and angioedema as key symptoms for
diagnosis of CU.
The most common complementary methods for CU diagnosis included physical examination
(96.6%), differential blood count (83.5%), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (77.4%) and C-reactive
protein (62.8%). Also, frequency of symptoms reported by patients was continuous in
71(16.4%), every day in 137 (31.7%), 3-5 times per week in 180 (41.7%), once per week in 21
(4.9%), and once per every several weeks in 28 (6.5%).

Patients’ current symptoms defined as absent when no sign/ symptom was evident, mild when
sign/symptom was clearly present, but minimal awareness or easily tolerated, moderate when
there was definite awareness of sign/symptom and bothersome but tolerable and severe when
sign/symptom was hard to tolerate and caused interference with daily activities. Severity of
symptoms was moderate in most of the patients (38.69%). Frequency of mild and severe
symptoms was 32.13% and 18.78%, respectively.

Type of urticaria in 398 (90.2%) patients was “ordinary uricaria” according to British
Association of Dermatologists (BAD) guideline and other types of urticaria diagnosed were
physical urticaria in 47 (10.7%) patients, angioedema without wheals in 15 (3.4%), contact
urticaria in 7(1.6%) and urticarial vasculitis in 2 (1.6%). No case of auto-inflammatory

syndromes was diagnosed in this study population.

Treatment strategies

Dermatologists reported that monotherapy with non-sedating antihistamines (nsAH) in regular
dose and high dose, as first line treatment, were 26 (74%) and 6 (17%), respectively. Topical
antihistamines, leukotriene antagonists and systemic immunosuppressive drugs were prescribed
by only 3% of dermatologists.

Different treatments for patients currently treated for their CU with resistant/ poor response to
first and second line treatment were presented in the Table Also, common treatments
combinations with at least 5 patients’ frequency were given in the second column of Table 1.
Monotherapy with “oral non-sedating anti histamines” was detected in 25% of patients, but “oral
non-sedating anti histamines in combination with other treatments” were prescribed in 75% of
patients. Also, sedating antihistamines were prescribed by 64% of dermatologists, usually in
combination with nsAH. As mentioned above, symptoms of many patients were resistant to first
and/ or second line treatment. So, sedating AH in combination with nsAH was the most common

strategy of combination therapy in these patients (Table 1).

To identify features that may have role in making therapeutic decisions, dermatologists asked to
rank 3 most important factors which influenced the patient treatment(s). The first rank was for
“severity or frequency of symptoms”. Drug efficacy and safety, had respectively second and

third rank (Table 2).

This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
The most used treatment strategies by dermatologists for CU patients were oral non-sedating
anti-histamines (nsAH) and oral sedating AH. Also, the longest mean duration of treatment was

13.5 (22.4) months for oral nsAH, and 6.7 (6.0) months for oral sedating AH.

oD) Treatment compliance and QoL

Three most common complaints of patients about interference of CU with daily activities were
(@) impairment of sleep (62.8%), mood (53.4%) and physical activity (36.2%). Impairment of social
e = activities (24.9%), job performance (21.3%), personal relationship (20.5%) and school

performance (10.9%) were the other reported complaints.

Treatment compliance was evaluated and recorded by dermatologists as Excellent, Very good,
Good, Intermediate, Poor, Very poor, Negative. About 94.1% of dermatologist was ranked oral
nsAH compliance as good and above. Frequency of patients with less than good compliance, 1.e.,
intermediate, poor, very poor or negative for topical antihistamines was 60% for oral sedating
AH and 57% for oral corticosteroids. The most common cause of this unsatisfactory compliance
oD) reported by dermatologists was efficacy concern for nsAH, side effects for oral sedating AH, fear
~— of side effects for oral corticosteroids and efficacy concerns for topical antihistamines (Table 3).
Cow” most common cause of less than good compliance reported by patients was mainly efficacy
concern under treatment (34.4%), adverse events produced by medications (27.9%), and fear of
adverse events reported by others (13.8%). Other causes, including patients’ preference,
CO) frequency of doses and route of administration were among less frequent reported causes of

insufficient compliance.

<— Compliance of dermatologist with BAD guideline

Out of total 35 dermatologists, 66% were familiar with British Association of Dermatologists
(BAD) guideline and 71% with other guidelines, respectively. Moreover, 80% (28) of them

believed that these guidelines are useful in categorizing of patients and helpful in finding the best

Discussion

This Study was a nationwide, multicenter, observational and cross-sectional study on the practice
of Iranian dermatologists in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with chronic urticaria. To our
knowledge, this is the first study on examining the real life treatment of urticarial patients in Iran.
About 90% of dermatologists used oral nsAHs as first-line treatment of patients. It can be
concluded that, generally, selection of first line treatment for patients was in accordance with
available CU treatment guideline recommendations. In the German survey, the most common
first-line treatments were also nsAHs in standard or higher doses (Weller, Viehmann et al.
2013). Similarly, Wu et al. found all physicians in their study (dermatologists, allergists and
immunologists) recommended second-generation antihistamines as first-line treatment(Wu,
Ardern-Jones et al. 2015). In the available national and international guidelines including
European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, World Allergy Organization, the
recommended first-line treatment is regular-dose nsAHs, followed by nsAHs in two fold to four
fold up-dosing)in second line (Grattan and Humphreys 2007; Zuberbier, Aberer et al. 2014;
Zuberbier, Aberer et al. 2018). Also, after the second line failure of treatment and for resistant
atient, sedating AH in combination with nsAHs, could be used to improve patients’ responses.
While nsAHs were actually being used by the majority of the physicians as the first-line
treatment, sedating AHs were still used by 9% of dermatologists(Weller, Viehmann et al. 2013).
The adherence of Iranian dermatologists to BAD guideline in this study was similar, and to some
extent, better than that reported by Weller et al. They reported that 18% of physicians used
systemic steroids in first line treatment that is not recommended by the guidelines (Weller,
Viehmann et al. 2013). In contrast, none of the dermatologists in this study used systemic
steroids as first line of treatment. One reason could be that, in this study, only dermatologists
were recruited but the study by Weller et al. included general practitioners, pediatricians and
dermatologists. Existing literature suggests that practitioners with different specialties may have
different approaches in the management of CU concerning, for example, guidelines used,

diagnostic tests performed, first-line treatment preferences, and prescription of alternative

treatment methods. Wu et al. found differences in the diagnosis and treatment of CU between
practitioners of different specialties, which reflected differences among the guidelines used more
dermatologists used the BAD guidelines in comparison with allergists and immunologists. On
the other hand, the BSACI guidelines and the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical
Immunology (EAACI)/ Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA 2 LEN)/European
Dermatology Forum (EDF)/World Allergy Organization (WAO) guidelines (2013) were used by
more allergists and immunologists compared to dermatologists.(Wu, Ardern-Jones et al. 2015).In
our study, majority of dermatologists was familiar with BAD guideline and other international
and/ or national guidelines. Also, the majority of dermatologists believed that BAD guideline is
helpful in determining best treatment for CU patients. Weller et al. reported the dermatologists
had the highest level of knowledge about management of CU guidelines, in comparison with
pediatricians and general physicians. (Weller, Viehmann et al. 2013).

The most common diagnostic approach for CU in our study was physical examination, followed
by differential blood count, ESR. Differential blood count, total IgE, allergy tests (e.g. prick
test), and CRP/ESR were reported as the most commonly used tests in the German study(Weller,
Viehmann et al. 2013). In contrast to C Weller et al. study in Germany that reported 81.4% of
dermatologist performed serum total IgE for their CU patients, none of dermatologist in our
study performed this test(Weller, Viehmann et al. 2013).In the study by Wu et al., differential
blood count, thyroid function, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were the most common
tests performed by dermatologists, allergists and immunologists(Wu, Ardern-Jones et al. 2015).
Differential blood count and ESR/CRP were recommended in the majority of the existing
guidelines for CU, while the BSACI guidelines and the BAD guidelines only recommended
ESR(Grattan and Humphreys 2007; Powell, Leech et al. 2015).

This study had some limitations, including observational design and recruiting only
dermatologists and not general physicians. Therefore, generalizability of the results to the Iranian
population of CU patients and to the total population of Iranian physicians practice in

management of CU patients should be done with caution.

This study provides useful insight into the real practice of Iranian dermatologists in the diagnosis
and treatment of CU patients. The real-life management of patients with CU by them is widely in
accordance with the BAD guideline and/ or other guidelines. The most common first-line
treatment for CU by Iranian dermatologists was nsAHs in regular or high doses. The real-life
management of patients with CU in Iran was in accordance with the available practice
guidelines, which emphasizes on the use of nsAHs in regular dose as first step, and updosing up
to 4-fold as second step in the management of chronic urticaria

Our results suggest that high level of knowledge about guidelines may result in an improvement
of diagnostic and therapeutic management of CU patients. To improve about the management of
CU patients, more efforts on availability and implementation of guidelines are needed to further
improve of CU diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients’ symptoms, and also,
improves patients’ quality of life (Qol) and treatment satisfaction as an another important goal,

beside treatments of disease symptoms.
