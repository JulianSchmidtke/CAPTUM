autoantibodies in chronic idiopathic
urticaria by induction of CD63

Background: Approximately 40% to 50% of patients with
chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) have functional IgG
autoantibodies against FceRIa or IgE, which induce histamine
release from basophils and cutaneous mast cells. A positive
autologous serum skin test response is believed to reflect the
presence of these autoantibodies.

Objective: We sought to further define the functional properties
of and develop a sensitive functional assay for detection of
autoantibodies in patients with CIU.

Methods: Sera from patients with CIU (n = 61) and sera from
healthy control subjects (n = 23) were incubated with donor
basophils. Activation of basophils was determined on the basis
of CD63 surface expression, as analyzed on a FACScan flow
cytometer.

Results: A positive basophil activation test result was found in
51% of patients with CIU, and basophil-activating properties
were present in the IgG fractions of sera. When both the in vitro
test and the autologous serum skin test were considered,
basophil/mast cell-activating autoantibodies were present in
62% of the patients. Patients with a positive basophil activation
test result had a significantly higher prevalence of other
autoantibodies, had more severe urticaria, and were more
likely to have angioedema.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the presence of basophilactivating autoantibodies in about 50% of patients with CIU.
The data support the autoimmune cause of the disease and
provide a simple test for detection of these autoantibodies.

of autologous serum produces a wheal-and-flare response
indicating the presence of circulating histamine-releasing
factors in the serum.? This finding has led to the identification of functional autoantibodies reactive against
either FeeRIa on basophils and dermal mast cells in
30% to 40% of patients with CIU or reactive against IgE in
an additional 5% to 10% of patients with CIU. A small
subgroup can have both autoantibodies.*° The antiFceRIa autoantibodies were initially identified on the
basis of the release of histamine from basophils and
dermal mast cells in vitro, and their presence subsequently
was confirmed by means of Western blot analysis,*>
ELISA,* and §-hexosaminidase release from transfected
rat leukemia cell lines. Functional anti-FceRIa autoantibodies are thought to cause basophil and mast cell
degranulation by means of direct cross-linking of several
FceRIa receptors (similar to the cross-linking by allergen). Anti-FceRIa autoantibodies in patients with CIU
were identified as predominantly IgG1 and IgG3 complement-activating isotypes, and complement (CSa) was
shown to enhance the activation of basophils and mast
cells by these antibodies.”* Neither Western blotting nor
ELISA can distinguish functional histamine-releasing
autoantibodies from nonfunctional autoantibodies. Non—
histamine-releasing anti-FceRIa autoantibodies, mainly
of the IgG2 or IgG4 subtype, have been found in autoimmune-mediated disorders like dermatomyositis, systemic lupus erythematosus, pemphigus vulgaris, and
bullous pemphigoid.”

At present, tests for detection of these functional
antibodies are done in a few specialized laboratories
only, are time-consuming, and are not available to the
majority of clinicians.° Our goal was to develop and
evaluate an easy and sensitive functional assay for their
detection. We compared the results with those of the
autologous serum skin test (ASST). We also looked for an
association between anti-FceRIa and the presence of other
autoantibodies, and we correlated the results of the in vitro
test to clinical features of patients with CIU.

METHODS
Subjects

Sixty-one patients with CIU were recruited from the allergy clinics
at the University Hospital in Leuven. They had a mean age of 42 years
(range, 14-79 years), and 22 were men. Nineteen patients had an
atopic profile (a history of eczema, asthma, or hay fever). All patients
had daily or almost daily urticaria for more than 6 weeks at the time of
the study. Forty-two (69%) of these patients had complaints of
delayed pressure urticaria. Forty-six (75%) of the patients with CIU
responded to antihistamines, and all received chronic treatment with
second-generation antihistaminics. Drugs potentially interfering with
the analysis were withdrawn before the study: antihistamines for 72
hours and doxepine and other tricyclic antidepressants for 10 days.
Corticosteroids were withdrawn for 4 weeks if possible, but 7 patients
continued to take low-dose corticosteroids. The severity of urticaria
was scored while not taking medications or while taking minimal
medications ona scale from 0 to 4 as follows: 0, no wheals; 1, 1 to 10
small (<3 cm in diameter) wheals; 2, 10 to 50 small wheals or | to 10
large wheals; 3, more than 50 small wheals or 10 to 50 large wheals;
and 4, virtually covered with wheals. The severity of itching was
scored as follows: 0, no; 1, mild; 2, moderate; and 3, severe.

Twenty-three healthy control subjects were recruited, with a mean
age of 34 years (range, 13-60 years), and 8 were men. Thirteen control
subjects had a history of eczema, asthma, or hay fever. All patients
provided informed consent to the study.

ASST

Sera were obtained from venous blood samples clotted at room
temperature for 20 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 550g for 10
minutes. Supernatants were divided into aliquots for use in the ASST
and in the basophil activation test. For skin testing, serum samples
were used immediately after clotting. Fifty microliters of autologous
serum was injected intradermally into the volar aspect of the forearm.
Areas known to have been involved in spontaneous wheals over the
last 24 hours were avoided. Skin reactivity was evaluated by using a
histamine intradermal test of 50 wL (0.5 mg/mL). Fifty microliters of
saline solution was used as a negative control. All injection sites were
scored at 20 minutes and 60 minutes after injection. The test result
was considered positive when the mean diameter of the wheal with
autologous serum was at least 2.5 mm larger than the mean diameter
of the wheal elicited by the negative control.

Basophil activation test

Basotest (Orpegen Pharma, Heidelberg, Germany) is a test kit for
the quantitative determination of the degranulation of basophilic
granulocytes in heparinized human whole blood and is designed for
in vitro detection of allergen-induced basophil activation by means of
FACScan flow cytometric analysis of CD63 expression on IgEbearing cells.'°!'! The surface marker CD63 (glycoprotein 53) is
expressed with high density on activated basophils but only weakly
on resting basophils. It is located in or on the granule membrane,
belongs to the tetraspan family, and is of unknown function.'® CD63
is also expressed on macrophages and platelets.'° The normal
procedure of the Basotest was adapted for detecting basophilactivating autoantibodies in the sera of patients with CIU.
Immediately after clotting, patient sera were stored at —20°C until
investigation. Before performing the basophil activation test, sera
were thawed to room temperature. One single donor was selected
because of optimal CD63 induction on his basophils, and all tests
were performed with heparinized blood from this donor. The donor
provided informed consent, is atopic (IgE-mediated allergy for house
dust mite, total IgE 68 U/mL), and is blood group O, rhesus positive.
One hundred microliters of heparinized whole blood from the

De Swerdt et al 663

basophil donor was preincubated with 20 «wL of stimulation buffer
(containing IL-3 at a final concentration of 20 ng/mL) for 10 minutes
at 37°C. IL-3 priming has been shown to affect the stimulation of
basophils with all known IgE-dependent (eg, anti-IgE and allergens),
as well as IgE-independent (eg, f-Met-Leu-Phe and CSa) agonists.'2! Then 100 .L of undiluted CIU or control serum was
added, followed by incubation for 60 minutes at 37°C. As a positive
control, the donor blood was incubated for 20 minutes with 100 wL of
f-Met-Leu-Phe. Degranulation was stopped by chilling on ice for
5 minutes. Thereafter, the cells were labeled with the 2-color antibody
reagent consisting of 2 different murine mAbs, namely phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-IgE and FITC-conjugated anti-CD63, and
incubated for 20 minutes on ice. Finally, the red blood cells were
lysed, and cells were washed and analyzed within 2 hours on a
FACScan flow cytometer. Only basophils with bright IgE expression
were gated. Data on at least 1000 basophils were acquired, and the
percentage of CD63-expressing basophils was calculated.

Decomplementation of sera and
purification of IgG

In some experiments CIU sera were heated for 30 minutes at 56°C
to inactivate complement. The IgGs were purified from 1-mL serum samples by means of affinity chromatography in a Protein
G-Sepharose column. The flow through was used as IgG-depleted
serum in further experiments after we checked that all IgGs were
retained in the column in one chromatography experiment. The
dilution factor of the serum, caused by the chromatography, was
taken into account in further experiments. IgGs were eluted from the
column by 0.1 M glycine-Cl, pH 2.8. Immediately after elution, the
buffer was exchanged for Dulbecco phosphate buffer in a salting-out
column (Econopac 10; Bio-Rad, Richmond, Calif). The purity was
checked by means of SDS-PAGE, and the concentration was
measured at 280 nm in a spectrophotometer. Later, all IgG samples
were concentrated to match a concentration of 10 mg/mL.

Statistical analysis
Statistical significance was determined by using the Wilcoxon

matched pairs test, the Mann-Whitney test, or the x test, where
appropriate. A P value of less than .05 was considered significant.

RESULTS
Basophil activation test

Fig 1 shows a typical example of the FACScan flow
cytometric analysis of donor basophils incubated with
serum from a patient with CIU or a control subject.
Resting basophils expressed high levels of membranebound IgE but were almost all negative for CD63.
Incubation with control serum did not induce CD63,
whereas incubation with this particular CIU serum did
induce CD63 on a proportion of the basophils.

The mean percentage of basophils expressing
CD63 after incubation with control sera (n = 23) was
6.59% + 1.37%. When this mean percentage + 3 SD
(being 10.70%) was taken as the upper limit of normal
CD63 induction, we found that 31 (51%) of 61 CIU sera
induced basophil activation (Fig 2). The mean percentage
of activated basophils with these 31 CIU sera was 39.01%
(range, 12.41% to 82.61%). The mean percentage of
activated basophils after incubation with the 30 negative
CIU sera was 6.84% (range, 2.47% to 9.95%).

FIG 1. FACS analysis of CD63 induction on basophils. Donor
PBMCs were incubated with PBS, control serum, or CIU serum
and then stained for CD63 and membrane IgE with mAbs. Membrane IgE staining (y-axis) is used to gate the basophils. Scatter
plots are shown on the /eft, and histograms of CD63 expression on
gated basophils are shown on the right.

The IgG fractions were isolated from 6 CIU sera to
prove that the basophil-activating properties of CIU sera
can be ascribed to IgG antibodies. In Fig 3 a representative
experiment is shown comparing the effect of a CIU serum
with its purified IgG fraction. The CIU serum in this
particular experiment activates 49% of donor basophils,
whereas the purified IgG from the same CIU serum
activates 37% of donor basophils, and the IgG-depleted
serum had no activity. It can also be seen in this experiment that heat inactivation of complement slightly reduced the capacity of this CIU serum to induce CD63. We
have also purified the IgG from 5 other CIU sera. These
IgG fractions induced 90%, 33%, 24%, 39%, and 14% of
CD63-expressing basophils, whereas 72%, 25%, 13%,
34%, and 29%, respectively, of CD63-expressing basophils were induced by the original CIU sera.

 

Correlation of the basophil activation test
with the ASST

Twenty-two (36%) of the 61 patients with CIU had a
positive ASST response. A significantly higher mean
percentage of activated donor basophils was found after
incubation with sera from patients with positive ASST

patients with negative ASST results (14.49% CD63*,
P =.0021, Fig 4). A significantly higher mean percentage
of activated donor basophils was also found after incubation with sera from patients with positive ASST results
compared with sera from control subjects (6.59% CD63",
P < .0001) and after incubation with sera from patients
with negative ASST results compared with sera from
control subjects (P = .0017).

When both the basophil activation test and ASST were
considered as markers of autoantibodies to basophils—
mast cells, 38 (62%) of 61 patients with CIU had at least
1 positive test result, and only 23 (38%) patients had
negative results on both tests (Table 1).

A positive basophil activation test result was found in
68% of patients with positive ASST results and in 41% of
patients with negative ASST results (P = .0416). A positive ASST result was found in 48% of patients with a
positive basophil activation test result and in 23% of
patients with a negative basophil activation test result
(P = .0416). Fifty-nine percent of patients with negative
ASST results had a negative basophil activation test result,
and 77% of patients with a negative basophil activation
test result had negative ASST results.

Correlation of basophil-activating properties
with the presence of other autoantibodies
and IgE levels

Forty-eight percent of patients with a positive basophil
activation test result had one or more other autoantibodies
(anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-thyroglobulin, anti-thyroid
peroxidase, or anti-parietal cell antibodies), whereas only
23% of patients with a negative basophil activation test
result had other autoantibodies (P = .0416, Table II).
Autoantibodies were present in 55% of patients with
positive ASST results and in 26% of patients with negative
ASST results (P = .0240). Total IgE serum levels were
significantly higher in patients with a negative basophil
activation test result than in patients with a positive

(P = .0449). Angioedema had occurred in 84% of patients
with a positive basophil activation test result and in 63% of
patients with a negative basophil activation test result
(P = .0683) and in 86% of patients with positive ASST
results and 67% of patients with negative ASST results
(P = .0931). All 15 patients with positive results on both
tests (basophil activation test and ASST) have severe
urticaria and angioedema. Eight (53%) of those 15 patients
also have other autoantibodies. Moreover, a significant
correlation was found between the degree of CD63
induction on basophils and the severity of urticaria as
assessed on the day of skin testing and blood sampling
(Spearman rank r = 0.3907, P < .002).

DISCUSSION

In this article we show that incubation of donor
basophils with CIU sera leads to CD63 expression as a
result of activation of the basophils in about 50% of cases.
This activation is due to basophil-activating IgG antibodies in CIU. When both the basophil-activating test and
ASST were combined as criteria for autoimmunity against
basophils—mast cells, the percentage of patients with CIU
with autoimmune characteristics increased to 62%. Our
data are in accordance with previously published results
reporting the presence of autoantibodies (anti-FceRIa,
anti-IgE, or both) in about 40% to 50% of patients with
clu!" and with a very recent study that also used CD63
expression in vitro for evaluating the presence of these
autoantibodies.'> The patients with a positive basophil
activation test result had more severe urticaria and were
more likely to have angioedema compared with the
patients with a negative basophil activation test result.
All patients who had positive results on both tests had
severe urticaria and angioedema. These findings are in
accordance with those of Sabroe et al,!° who also found
more severe disease in the autoimmune urticaria subgroup.

Thirty-six percent of the patients with CIU had a
positive ASST result, which is a lower positivity rate
than on the basophil activation test. A significantly higher
prevalence of a positive basophil activation test result was
detected in patients with positive ASST results than in
patients with negative ASST results. Conversely, a significantly higher prevalence of positive ASST results was
detected in patients with a positive basophil activation test

result than in patients with a negative basophil activation
test result. These data are similar to the findings of
Gyimesi et al.'° Both tests are clearly not completely
overlapping. Indeed, 26% of the patients with CIU had a
positive basophil activation test result and a negative
ASST result. Possible explanations are that the basophil
activation test is more sensitive than the ASST or that in
patients with negative ASST results (with chronic autoimmune urticaria), the dermal mast cells were desensitized
at the time of the ASST. Eleven percent of the patients
with CIU had a negative basophil activation test result and
a positive ASST result. In these cases the presence of antiIgE autoantibodies could be the explanation. Indeed,
phycoerythrin-labeled anti-IgE, used to identify basophils
in the basophil activation test, could theoretically prevent
binding of anti-IgE autoantibodies and thus result in a
false-negative basophil activation test result. Another
explanation is the existence of a mast cell-specific histamine-releasing factor,® causing a positive ASST result
and a negative basophil activation test result. Also, falsepositive ASST results could be due to bradykinin or CS5a
generated in serum during clotting.

A significantly higher prevalence of other autoantibodies (anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-thyroglobulin, antithyroidperoxidase, or anti-parietal cell antibodies) was
found in patients with a positive basophil activation test
result compared with in patients with a negative basophil
activation test result. A similar significant difference in
occurrence of other autoantibodies was found in patients
with positive ASST results compared with in patients with
negative ASST results. Gyimesi et al'° also found a
frequent occurrence of thyroid antibodies in the ASSTpositive and CD63-positive groups. Total IgE serum
levels were significantly lower in patients with a positive
basophil activation test result than in patients with a
negative basophil activation test result, and these data are
similar to those of Gyimesi et al,5 Sabroe et al,!° and
Hidvegi et al.'’ This might reflect a shift toward Ty]
predominance in autoimmune chronic urticaria, as suggested by Fiebiger et al,” although more recent data
suggest a Ty,0 profile or a mixture of a Ty] and Ty2

profile.'*!° Interestingly, the occurrence of atopy was not
different between the 2 groups of patients with CIU.

In summary, the results of the basophil activation test
with CIU sera support an autoimmune cause for this
disease in about 50% of the patients. The combination of
the ASST and the basophil activation test might be most
useful for identification of patients with the autoimmune
variant of CIU.
