Background: Chronic urticaria (CU) has an adverse effect on academic achievement and psychosocial development in

Objective: We aimed to investigate the natural course of CU and to identify relevant factors associated with a poor CU

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 253 children with episodes of wheals or angioedema at least 3 times a week that persisted for at least 6 weeks. Clinical data and laboratory results were obtained from medical records and parental telephone
interviews. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log rank tests were performed to assess the median time to remission of CU

Results: Median age at onset was 5.0 years (interquartile range, 2.5-9.1) and median follow-up period was 7.6 months
(interquartile range, 3.9-19.7). Of 253 patients, 68.8% had chronic inducible urticaria and 31.2% had chronic spontaneous
urticaria. Physical urticaria was the only cause of chronic inducible urticaria, and the most common physical urticaria
was dermographism. Median duration to remission of CU was 10.2 months (95% confidence intervals, 8.0-12.5 months).
Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that 33.4%, 53.0%, and 71.2% of children were in remission at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively, after the onset of CU. The presence of allergic sensitization was significantly associated with a poor CU prognosis in
univariable and multivariable analyses (P = 0.010 and P = 0.014, respectively).

Conclusion: Half of children with CU were in remission 10.2 months after onset. Allergic sensitization was a risk factor

Introduction

Chronic urticaria (CU) is defined as wheals with recurrent
episodes lasting for at least 6 weeks. The prevalence of CU has
been reported to be 0.5-5.0% in the general population and
about 0.1-0.3% in children.’ It is known that children have
a lower prevalence than adults.! Impairment of quality of life
in patients with CU is comparable to that experienced by
patients with other chronic diseases such as ischemic heart
disease, cystic fibrosis, and epilepsy.**? CU impairs physical
activity and lowers social function, which can adversely affect
academic achievement and psychosocial development in children and adolescents.**

Acute urticaria is frequently associated with identifiable
causes; in contrast, it is difficult to identify the etiology and to
predict the occurrence or exacerbation of symptoms in patients
with CU.** CU is classified into chronic spontaneous urticaria
(CSU) and chronic inducible urticaria (CIU) according to

whether symptoms occur spontaneously or are induced by
specific triggers. Although its pathogenesis is poorly understood, mixed Th1/Th2 immune response, mast cell activation,
and autoimmunity are considered to play a role in the pathogenic mechanisms of CU.’ There are also several types of
evidence supporting that autoantigen is synthesized by specific
triggers leading to mast cell degranulation in patients with
CIU.*? In general, the duration of CSU is 1-5 years, but is
likely to be longer in more severe cases.'° A previous Korean
study reported that the mean duration of CU was 3.76 years
in 641 adults."' The co-existence of angioedema, severity, and
the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies were associated with
longer disease duration in adult patients with CU.'?! However, few studies have investigated the clinical course or identified
prognostic factors of CU in children.

Providing correct information about the etiology and prognosis of CU can reduce the anxiety of pediatric patients and
their parents and help establish a therapeutic plan. Therefore,
our aims in this study were to investigate the clinical features
and natural course of CU and to identify factors associated with
a poor CU prognosis in Korean children.

Methods
Patients

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients
18 years or younger that were diagnosed with CU in Samsung
Medical Center from January 2007 to October 2015. The definition of CU was wheals or angioedema that had lasted for more
than 6 weeks and that occurred repeatedly (more than 3 times
a week).

Demographic and clinical data were collected, including

gender, age at onset, duration and frequency of symptoms,
extent of skin involvement, presence of angioedema, and
personal and familial history of allergic or autoimmune diseases. A family history of allergic diseases was defined as the
presence of one or more family members diagnosed with atopic
dermatitis, asthma, or allergic rhinitis by a physician.
All patients were interviewed using a detailed questionnaire regarding trigger factors such as sunlight, cold, water,
pressure, vibration, exercise, scratching, foods, and drugs. Food
or drug allergy was defined as a convincing history of reproducible symptoms within two hours after exposure to a single
‘ood or drug. Physical urticaria was diagnosed according to
the criteria described by the Joint Task Force on Practice
Parameters." In addition, medication use for CU (H1 receptor
antagonists, H2 receptor antagonists, leukotriene antagonists,
oral corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and biologic agents)
was investigated.

For patients who did not have data regarding remission of
clinical symptoms on their medical chart, a telephone survey
was utilized based on a preformulated questionnaire. Complete remission of CU was defined as the absence of urticaria
for at least 4 weeks without any medication.’ This study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Samsung
Medical Center (IRB No.2015-06-188).

 

Laboratory test
Eosinophils in peripheral blood, erythrocyte sedimentary

rate (ESR), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine
(T4), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroid auto-antibodies (thyroglobulin antibody, antimicrosomal antibody, and TSH receptor antibody), antinuclear antibody (ANA), serum C-reactive
protein (CRP) levels, and serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE)
levels were measured. The ANA test was performed by using
the indirect immunofluorescence method with sera (Fluoro
Hepana Test, MBL, Nagoya, Japan). Skin prick tests (Allergopharma, Reinbek, Germany) on the back or measurement of
specific IgE levels with the immunoCAP system (Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) were performed regarding
the following common allergens: Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, D. farinae, egg white, cow’s milk, wheat, soybean, and
peanut. Positive sensitization was defined as a wheal diameter
= 3 mm or specific IgE levels = 0.35 kU/L. Eosinophilia was
defined as when eosinophils comprised more than 4% of total
leukocytes.

Statistical analysis

Data for continuous variables were shown as median and
interquartile range. Prevalence rates were shown as percentages. Cumulative survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan
-Meier method, and relationships between the cumulative
probability of complete remission of CU and prognostic factors were analyzed using a log-rank test. The influence of
prognostic factors on remission was evaluated by univariable
Cox regression analyses. The relative importance of multiple
prognostic factors on CU remission was analyzed using multivariable analysis in conjunction with the Cox proportional
regression model. Variables with a P value of less than 0.2 in
univariable analysis were chosen for multivariable analysis.
Candidate variables for adjustment included gender, age at
onset (< 5 years old or = 5 years old), clinical symptoms (with
or without angioedema), past history of allergic diseases
(presence or absence), past history of autoimmune diseases
(presence or absence), family history of allergic diseases
(presence or absence), inducible factors (presence or absence),
sensitization (negative or positive), total IgE (< 200 kU/L or
2 200 kU/L), eosinophils (< 4% or = 4%), ESR (< 20 mm/hr
or = 20 mm/hr), CRP (< 0.5 mg/dl or > 0.5 mg/dl), and ANA
(negative or positive). CRP and ANA were excluded from the
multivariate analysis because data were available for only 80
and 88 cases, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed
using SAS (version 9.3, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Statistical significance was defined as a P value < 0.05.

Results

A total of 253 patients (142 boys and 111 girls) with CU
were included in this study. Median age at onset was 5.0 years
(interquartile range, 2.5-9.1) and median follow-up period was
7.6 months (interquartile range, 3.9-19.7 months) (Table 1).
Overall, 29 (11.5%) patients had wheals accompanied with angioedema, while 224 (88.5%) patients had wheals only without
angioedema. Of 253 patients, 68.8% (174/253) had CIU, while
31.2% (79/253) had CSU. The only cause of 174 patients with
CIU was physical urticaria, and the most common physical
urticaria was dermographism (128/174, 73.6%), followed by
cholinergic urticaria (76/174, 43.7%), cold urticaria (15/174,

8.6%), delayed pressure urticaria (9/174, 5.2%), solar urticaria
(3/174, 1.7%), and aquagenic urticaria (2/174, 1.1%).

Twenty-two (25.0%) of 88 patients who underwent testing
for ANA were positive. However, only one of these 22 patients
had a history of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus
erythematosus. TSH was elevated in only one of the 50 patients
(2.0%) who underwent a thyroid function test, but her T3 and
free T4 levels were normal.

During the observation period, 195 (77.0%) children had
complete remission. In Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, 33.4%,
53.0%, and 71.2% of patients recovered at 6, 12, and 24 months
after symptom onset, respectively (Figure 1). The median duration of CU was 10.2 months (95% confidence intervals, 8.0-12.5
months). A total of 190 patients (75.1%) were treated with H1
receptor antagonist alone, while 50 patients (19.8%) received
two H1 receptor antagonists or more. In addition, nine patients
(3.6%) were treated with both H1 and H2 receptor antagonists,
and 21 patients (8.3%) were treated with an H1 receptor antagonist as well as a leukotriene receptor antagonist. No patients
required systemic corticosteroids for => 3 consecutive days or
anti-IgE treatment.

Univariable analysis showed that patients who did not have
inducible factors (CSU) or were not sensitized to common
allergens had a better prognosis than those who had CIU or were
sensitized to allergens (P = 0.021 and P = 0.010, respectively)
(Table 2). In Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, 40.7%, 60.9%,
and 78.3% of CSU recovered at 6, 12, and 24 months after
symptom onset, respectively. In addition, 29.4%, 49.4%, and
67.8% of CIU patients recovered at 6, 12, and 24 months,

old). However, there were no significant differences in disease
duration with respect to gender or age (P = 0.697 and P = 0.092,
respectively) (Table 2). In addition, no differences were found
in CU prognosis according to the presence of angioedema, past
medical history, family history of allergic diseases, or laboratory
findings such as total IgE level, eosinophilia, ESR, CRP level, or
ANA status.

Multivariable analysis also showed that allergic sensitization was associated with the persistence of CU (P = 0.014), and
a trend for an association between the presence of inducible
factors and remission was seen (P = 0.081) (Table 2). There were
no differences between patients who went into remission and

those that did not with respect to gender, age, the presence of
angioedema, past medical history, family history of allergic
diseases, or laboratory findings.

Discussion

In our present study, we found that half of children with
CU achieved remission at 10.2 months after disease onset.
Overall, 33.4%, 53.0%, and 71.2% of patients achieved remission within 6, 12, and 24 months of disease onset. In addition,
the symptoms of about 75% of subjects improved in response
to avoiding inducible factors or taking a regular dose of H1
antihistamines, indicating a good response to conservative or

medical treatment. To our knowledge, this is the largest study
to describe the natural course and prognostic factors of CU in
Korean children. The percentages of patients in remission at
different time points in the present study are inconsistent with
those reported in previous studies.’*”° Kang et al. reported a
remission rate of 84.8% in Korean children with CU at the 1
year follow-up, which is a better prognosis than what we found
in our study.'* However, previous studies conducted in other
countries reported poorer outcomes than those of our study
and Kang et al’s study. For example, a Turkish study reported
that 16.5%, 38.8%, and 50.0% of children with CSU showed
an improvement in symptoms within 1 year, 3 years, and 5
years after disease onset, respectively.” In Japanese and Thai
studies, symptoms improved in 36.6% and 18.5% of patients,
respectively, within 1 year.'*"*

Disagreement among studies on the natural course of CU
might be due to differences in the study population and the
presence of inducible factors. In particular, a younger age is
ikely to be associated with a better prognosis.'*”° In our study,
the median age of patients was 5 years old, which is younger
than the 8-9 years described in previous studies.'*?° In addition, gender might affect the prognosis of CU, because sex
ormones are involved in the action of mast cells, peripheral
basophil cells, and dendritic cells.‘ In our study, the male to
emale ratio was 1.3: 1, which is a higher male predominance
than in other studies.'*”? According to previous reports, 5080% of CU patients have CSU, and only 25-40% of CU patients
ave inducible factors, of which physical urticaria is the
most common.” In our study, 31.2% of the patients did not
have any cause of urticaria, despite detailed history taking and
several tests. The only cause of CIU was physical urticaria,
and dermographism was the most common cause of physical
urticaria, consistent with another domestic study that reported
that 42.3% of CU patients have dermographism.'* In the present study, the proportion of CSU was lower than that reported
in a previous study.'® We should note that our study included
dermographism as an inducible CU factor, whereas previous
studies did not.

Allergic sensitization was the only factor that was associated
with a worse CU prognosis in our present study, although the
importance of atopic status in the pathogenesis of CU is still
a matter of debate. A previous Korean study showed that children with CU had a higher prevalence of sensitization against
house dust mites and polysensitization compared to those
with acute urticaria.** Several previous studies have reported
a higher prevalence of sensitization to variable allergens in
patients with CU than in normal healthy subjects,”*’* while
fewer studies have investigated the association between atopy
and CU prognosis. Recently, Song et al. reported that house
dust mite sensitization as well as a positive autologous serum
skin test (ASST) result were related to more severe disease and
a longer disease duration.** Furthermore, higher expression
of CD63 was observed in basophils from patients with CSU,
suggesting that spontaneous basophil activation may contribute
to the relationship between CU and allergic sensitization.”

The presence of inducible factors and/or autoimmune
antibodies have been considered poor prognostic factors in
previous studies of patients with CU, although this is still controversial.*”> We found a trend for an association between

 

APJAI

the presence of inducible factors and remission without statistical significance in the multivariable analysis. A previous
study found that symptom duration was longer in autoimmune
urticaria, which was defined in that study as positive ASST,
than CSU.” In that study, 17% of patients with CU were
ANA positive, and 16% and 12% of patients were positive for
anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and anti-microsomal antibodies,
respectively.” These autoantibodies could activate basophils
and mast cells to induce histamine release by complement.”
In our present study, the ANA-positive rate was 25.0%, which
is higher than that reported previously for healthy children
(6-14%).*!*2 However, we did not find an association between
CU prognosis and autoimmune diseases, because the number of
patients who received tests for autoantibodies was too small for
robust statistical evaluation of this relationship. Further studies
are required to identify additional prognostic factors in children
with CU.

Our study had some limitations that must be considered.
This study was performed in a single tertiary center, therefore selection bias might have occurred. Secondly, remission
state was determined by telephone survey for some patients
because of the retrospective nature of the study. There might
be patients with persistent disease who were selectively missed,
although the telephone survey was done with all caregivers
whose children were lost to follow-up. In addition, the same
laboratory tests were not performed in all patients. Therefore,
some variables such as CRP and ANA were not included
in the multivariable analysis. It also should be noted that
the treatment in our present study followed Korean Expert
Opinion Report on the Management of CU, not international
guidelines.® Despite these limitations, we provide useful information regarding the natural course of CU in children, the
response rates to medical treatment, and prognostic factors.

In conclusion, the median duration of CU in Korean children was 10.2 months, and half of the CU patients showed
symptom improvement within a year, indicating that children
with CU had a favorable outcome. Allergic sensitization was
associated with a poor CU prognosis.

Abstract

Background: The goals of asthma management aim to control the symptoms and minimize future risk. There is, however,
an option to stop controller medication if the patient has been well-controlled for at least 6-12 months. To assess control,
both clinical symptom assessment and lung function should be monitored periodically. In practical clinical practice of
pediatric patients, lung function is not available at all health centers.

Objectives: to determine lung function with a focus on small airway function and the risk of reversibility among children
who have been symptom-controlled.

Methods: Our participants were symptom-controlled asthmatic children according to GINA Guideline for at least 6
months with low dose inhaled corticosteroid. Written informed-consent was given by the parents and the children. They
performed a self-evaluated symptom-controlled test (C-ACT) and a spirometric assessment. Abnormal lung function was
defined as FEV, < 80%, FEV,/FVC < 80%, and FEF, .. < 65% predicted. Airway reversibility was determined by the change
of FEV, > 12% and FEF,, .. > 30% post bronchodilator.

Results: Forty children (65% male) were enrolled. Age ranged between 6.7 and 15.0 years. The mean C-ACT score was 25.2
+ 1.7. Spirometry results were: mean FEV, 84.0%, FEV ,/FVC 87.8%, and FEF... ,, 85.5% predicted. Normal FEV, was found
among 72.5% of participants compared to normal FEF,. .. in 87.5%. Among the abnormal FEV, and FEF, ,.., all were of
mild severity as 10% retained airway reversibility.

25-75

Conclusion: Children with well-controlled asthma, based on their symptom assessment, may have persistent abnormal

 

lung function. Spirometry should be performed before considering cessation of controller medication.

Key words: small airway function, symptom-controlled, asthma, pediatric, spirometry

Introduction

According to the terms of the Global Initiative for Asthma,
the long-term goals for asthma management are to achieve good
symptom control, and to minimize future risk of exacerbations,
fixed airflow limitation, and side-effects of treatment. Symptom
control is assessed using the frequency of daytime & night-time
asthma symptoms, reliever use, and activity limitation. Poor
symptom control is a risk factor for future exacerbations. Lung
function, which mainly focuses on FEV, and the FEV /FVC
ratio, should be assessed as an indicator of future risk.!

It is well-established that inflammation in asthma involves
not only the large airways, but also the small airways; the

complete airway tree.** Small airway inflammation is recognized as having an important role in controlling asthma.
Increasing evidence suggests that small-airway dysfunction is
associated with the clinical features of asthma: such as poor
control of asthma and higher numbers of exacerbations.’ In
addition, significant bronchodilator reversibility in a patient
taking controller treatment also suggests uncontrolled asthma.’

When asthma is well-controlled, complete cessation of
inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in adults is not advised as the
risk of exacerbations is increased." Nevertheless, a physician
may consider stopping controller treatment only if there have

been no symptoms for 6-12 months and the patient has no risk
factors.’ By comparison, in clinical pediatric practice, routine
lung function at each visit is difficult to perform. Moreover,
spirometry is not available at all health care centers in our
country (Thailand), so assessment of asthma symptom control
is accomplished for reviewing the treatment and controller
cessation. Even if children have clinical symptom control, the
future risk of exacerbations and lung function (especially of the
small airways) are unknown. We, thus, conducted the current
study to determine lung function with a focus on small airway
function as well as the risk of reversibility among children who
have been assessed as symptom-controlled.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, descriptive study in children
diagnosed with asthma according to the GINA guideline, and
who regularly attended the Pediatric Asthma Clinic at Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen University, between August
2015 and August 2016. At each visit, the patients were assessed
for symptoms and those who met the criteria for symptom
-controlled were invited to participate in the study. This study
was approved by the Ethics Committee for Human Research of
Khon Kean University, Thailand (HE581314)

Study populations

The enrolled asthmatic children were: 1) between 6 and
5 years of age and regularly attended the clinic; 2) symptom
-controlled for at least 6 months [as per the GINA 2015 clinical
assessment]; 3) regularly used low-dose inhaled controllers
(Budesonide < 200 ug/day or Fluticasone < 200 ug/day plus
LABA)'; and, 4) able to perform spirometry. Each child participant had informed, written parental consent as well as
giving their own assent. Children who had had a respiratory
infection in the previous 1 month and had a history of using
bronchodilator before performing spirometry within 6 hours
were excluded. The symptom control score for the last 1-month
of symptoms was determined using the childhood asthma
control test (C-ACT).° Parents and children who met all the
eligibility criteria were asked to perform the C-ACT test before
performing spirometry.

 

Symptom-controlled (GINA clinical assessment)! was defined as exhibiting none of the following: daytime symptoms
more than twice/week; any night waking due to asthma; any
reliever needed for symptoms more than twice/week; and, any
activity limitation due to asthma in the past 4 weeks.

Childhood asthma control test (C-ACT)° is a seven-item
assessment questionnaire, completed by the child and parent/
caregiver, for assessing asthma control in children between 4
and 11 years of age in the preceding four weeks: the total score
ranges between 0 and 27. The C-ACT test has been translated
into Thai; however, it has not been validated in Thai children.

Pulmonary and small airway function
Lung function was measured using a CHEST multifunctional spirometer HI - 801. Typical FEV, and FEV,/FVC were

evaluated to determine large airway function, and FEF,, .—

the latter reflecting small airway function. Repeated spirometry was performed 15 minutes after giving inhaled Ventolin
Evohaler® plus spacer to determine reversibility of the airway.
Abnormal lung function was defined as FEV, < 80% predicted,
FEV,/FVC < 80%, and FEF jeg < 65%. Post bronchodilator,
the change of FEV, > 12% and FEF,, .. > 30%, was positive for
reversibility.”* Spirometry was performed by the same trained
nurse throughout the study. We documented the demographic
characteristics, BMI, family history of atopy, co-morbidity, time
of asthma diagnosis, and treatment.

Study analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version
19. Continuous data were presented as means + SD, medians,
and ranges (minimum to maximum). Categorical data were
presented as numbers and percentages of each group.

Results

There were 40 patients who met the eligibility criteria. There
were 26 (65%) males and overall the age ranged between 6.7
and 15.0 years (mean, 10.4 + 2.0). BMI ranged between 12.4
and 27.2 (mean, 18.3 + 3.8 kg/m’). No child was diagnosed
as obese (i.e., BMI > 95" percentile). Half of the patients had
a co-morbidity with the allergic rhinitis. Sixteen (40%) had a
family history of smoking by the father and/or grandfather.
Other baseline characteristics included mean duration of diagnosed asthma (6.0 + 3.2 years) and mean duration of taking
ICS (5.6 + 3.3 years). Half of the patients had had a history of
admission due to asthma exacerbation prior to being symptom-controlled (average, 2 times). (Table 1) No child had severe

but none experienced a severe exacerbation or admission in the
past year nor were they activity-limited. All of them achieved
asthma-control and the ICS could be stepped down to a low
dose for more than 6 months, as required before enrollment.

In the abnormal lung function group, none showed any
airway reversibility. One child had both mild fixed abnormal
FEV, and FEF,, ,,. (Pre & Post BD FEV, = 71.4 & 75%, FEE, ..
= 46.8 & 58% predicted, respectively). The child had a BMI of
27.3 kg/m? and had been diagnosed with asthma at 5. He had
been on ICS for 5 years without any severe exacerbation, but
was a passive smoker from his father since birth and his C-ACT
score was 26.

Discussion

This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that all
asthmatic children who have achieved symptom controlled
with low-dose ICS for at least 6 months have normal lung function of the entire airway but in particular of the small airway.
As for asthma management, all of the patients not only have to
achieve good symptom control, the future risk of exacerbations
should be minimal. One of the important future risks is low
FEV,. In addition, significant bronchodilator reversibility in a
patient taking controller treatment suggests uncontrolled asthma.' The current study showed that some children who were
supposed to be well-controlled according to their symptom
assessment, continued to have both abnormal large and small
airway function.

Several studies have been conducted to determine the correlation of symptom assessment and lung function during the
treatment follow-up period. Munoz et al. demonstrated that
eosinophilic or neutrophilic inflammation persisted in most
well-controlled asthma patients despite their condition being
controlled.’ Recent studies, moreover, showed that small airway
dysfunction is not only a feature of severe asthma but can also
present in patients with mild asthma who have a low level of
symptoms and normal FEV, values.’*'* Huang et al. demonstrated that the majority of children with well-controlled asthma continued to have airway hyper-responsiveness and low
small airway function as represented by FEF,, ,,."4

Many physiological and imaging techniques have been used
to evaluate small airway function, including impulse oscillometry, exhaled nitric oxide, inert gas washout, high resolution
computed tomography, and spirometry.'> Spirometry is often
readily available and used most frequently in routine clinical
practice. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV,) and
FEV /forced vital capacity (FVC) mainly represent the larger
airways, whereas forced expiratory flow between 25% and
75% of forced vital capacity (FEF,,..) reflects small airway
unction.'> Rao et al showed that asthmatic children who had
a low FEF,, .. had nearly 3 times the odds (OR 2.8) of systemic
corticosteroid use and 6 times the odds of asthma exacerbations
(OR 6.3) compared with those who had normal spirometry.
n addition, they also concluded that using the percent change
in FEF,,.. may be helpful in identifying bronchodilator
responsiveness in asthmatic children with a normal FEV,.’ Due
to our limited resources, we used spirometric results (FEF, ..
predicted) to represent small airway function and pre-post
bronchodilator values to determine airway hyper-reactivity.
We found that FEF,, .. did not add more useful information for

 

the detection of abnormal lung function. Nevertheless, among
children who had a normal FEV,, four (10%) continued to
have airway reversibility especially of the small airway. Prior to
being considered symptom-controlled, these four children
were treated with ICS at a medium dose level. Regarding clinical assessment of future risk of exacerbation, they did not have
any striking history, such as a history of severe exacerbation
during the preceding year, no activity limitations or C-ACT
score between 22-26. Two children had allergic rhinitis as a
co-morbidity and environmental smoking exposure. Notwithstanding these clinical characteristics, they were similar to
children with normal lung function. The finding of significant
bronchodilator reversibility (i.e., an increase in FEV, > 12%,
FEF,. ,, > 30%)'° in a patient taking controller treatment suggests persistent uncontrolled asthma, which should be regarded
as evidence for further continuing treatment.' Early controller
cessation in these patients might lead to severe exacerbation
and fixed airway obstruction in the future. This study confirmed
the usefulness of assessment of small airway reversibility to
determine asthma control status in children.*'

The recent international practice guideline for asthma recommends that lung function—especially spirometry—is a
useful indicator of exacerbation, so it should be monitored
together with clinical assessment at the start of treatment, after 3-6 months of controller treatment, and periodically going
forward.'”"* Monitoring asthma management in children according to these guidelines is challenging. In general, symptom
control assessment as provided by GINA is used routinely for
control-based asthma management at most healthcare centers
in our country. Nevertheless, several asthma control scores for
children—i.e., Chilhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT)—have
been developed to help in clinical assessment.’ Medication
adjustment as well as cessation of controller mainly depended
on subjective symptom control assessments. The current study
used the GINA assessment at the level of well-controlled as
indicating symptom control.' We also compared the GINA
assessment with the C-ACT score and found that most
children who were well-controlled had a C-ACT score in the
range of 22 to 27. Only one child whose lung function (both
FEV, and FEF,,..) was normal had a C-ACT score of 19. The
results of our study on symptom-control assessment are similar to the study by Koolen et al. who showed that a C-ACT
score correlated well with the GINA criteria and that children
who were well-controlled had a C-ACT score in the range
of 23 to 27.!° By comparison, Ito et al. showed that a C-ACT
cut-off score of 23 was useful for identifying children with
well-controlled asthma (sensitivity 78%; specificity 54%).”° This
C-ACT score has been translated into Thai but is not widely
used possibly because it has not yet been validated.

The European Task Force recommends performing spirometry annually as a minimum, when monitoring asthma in
children.'* The results of our study confirmed the usefulness
of objective monitoring in asthma patients especially spirometry; however, in our country, spirometry is not available at all
levels of health care. The current study demonstrated that even
if the clinical assessment (either GINA or C-ACT score) of
asthmatic children indicates symptom controlled’ their lung
function might not be normal and they may even have airway
reversibility. We, therefore, suggest that before considering

cessation of controller medication in children over 6 with
well-controlled asthma, a lung function test be performed to
demonstrate the actual status, if available.

The limitations of this study were that (a) symptom control
assessments were done by several pediatricians caring for the
patients, so there will be some variation in assessments; (b) no
inter-rater variation was performed before enrollment; and (c)
we had a small sample size. In addition, it was a cross-sectional
study that might not be able to determine the exact future
clinical outcomes. Further study with an adequate sample
size and long term cohort should be performed to add more
evidence to support the clinical practice guideline.

Conclusion

The current study demonstrated that asthmatic children,
who are considered symptom-controlled based on an assessment of their treatment and symptoms, may still have abnormal
lung function. Spirometry should be performed before considering cessation of controller medication.

Abstract

Background: Subtropical grass pollens of Bermuda (BGP), Johnson (JGP), and Para or buffalo grass (PGP), are common
causes of pollen allergies in warm climate area. Allergic rhinitis (AR) patients had positive skin prick test (SPT) to extract
of these 3 grass pollens. However, no allergenic proteins of 3 grass pollens have never been studied.

Objective: To identify major allergens of BGP, JGP, and PGP in Thai grass pollen-allergic patients and to examine their
sIgE cross-reactivity.

Methods: Serum of nine AR patients with positive SPT to at least 2 of 3 studied pollens were collected. Based on availability,
only ImmunoCAP of BGP and JGP were available to determine a level of sIgE. Profiles of slgE bound proteins from BGP,
JGP, and PGP, were obtained by immunoblot. Major IgE bound protein was identified by liquid chromatography-tandem
mass spectrophotometry (LC-MS/MS). Cross-reactivity of purified major allergen of the 3 grass pollens was determined by
inhibition of sIgE in both ELISA and immunoblot.

Results: AR patients who have positive SPT to extract of BGP, JGP, and PGP, were 9, 8, and 6, respectively. Positive sIgE
(> 0.35 KUA/L) to BGP and JGP were found in 9 and 8 patients, respectively. Eight profiles of IgE bound proteins of the 3
grass pollens showed 29-30 kDa pollen protein as major allergen and was identified as beta-expansin (ExpB). Moreover,
purified ExpB of the 3 grass pollens cross-inhibited serum sIgE.

Conclusion: Approximately 30 kDa ExpB of BGP, JGP, and PGP, are major cross-reactive allergen for AR Thai patients.

Key words: Subtropical grass pollen allergens, pollen allergy, Allergic rhinitis, beta-expansin, allergic airway diseases,

Allergens from grass pollens (GP) are one of major causes
of allergic airway diseases, especially allergic rhinitis (AR).'”
Subtropical grasses in Chloridoideae subfamily (Bermuda
grass, B, or Cynodon dactylon) and in Panicoideae subfamily
(Johnson grass, J, or Sorghum halepense, and Para or Buffalo
grass, P, or Brachiaria mutica, also known as Urochloa mutica),
are commonly distributed in warm regions such as parts of
Africa, Asia, Australia, United States of America (California
and Florida), Central and South America.? BGP, JGP, and
PGP are reported as a source of allergenic proteins triggering
allergic inflammation in upper airway. To date, 7 allergens of
BGP and 2 allergens of JGP have been reported.? However, to
date, allergens of PGP have not yet been identified. In Thailand,
pollens of grasses are one of major airborne pollens found in
a high count throughout a year and are highest count in May

and September for grass pollen < 40 um and in September
for grass pollen > 40 tm.’ It has been reported that, based on
skin prick test (SPT), 52.3% and 49.4% of 736 Thai patients
attending the ENT Allergy Clinic at Siriraj Hospital, had
reaction to protein extract of BGP and PGP, respectively.’
Moreover, It was recently reported that, based on SPT results,
45.6% of 68 Thai volunteers with respiratory allergy had
reaction to JGP extract.’ These findings indicated that allergens
of BGP, JGP, and PGP, are one of major causes for respiratory
allergy in sensitized Thai patients. Despite these results,
however, pollen allergens from these 3 pollens sensitized by
Thai patients have not yet been identified. Therefore, this
study aimed to identify major allergenic proteins of BGP, JGP,
and PGP, sensitized by Thai pollen-allergic patients as well as
examine their cross-reactivity.

Methods
Patients

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board,
Siriraj Hospital (SiEc 100/2012). Forty patients with history of
AR were recruited. All patients signed an informed consent
before SPT. Thirty-one of them were excluded due to mono
-sensitization to grass allergen. Nine patients, aged 9-47 years
old (mean 26.3 + 4 years), were included in this study based on
positive SPT (mean wheal diameter, MWD 2 3 mm) to protein
extract from at least 2 of 3 BGP, JGP, and PGP. The SPT extracts
were prepared as described previously.* Determination of level
of serum sIgE against extract of BGP and JGP was carried out
by ImmunoCAP (Phadia, Uppsala, Sweden). However, there is
no available test for PGP.

Pollen collection

Grass flowers were collected from various sites in Thailand.
Flowers were dissected under a stereo-microscope and identified to species using identification key. Flowers were left for
natural shedding for 1 day. Pollen grains were incubated for 24
h in a chamber containing silica gel before purified by passing
through 120, 150, and 230 mesh-sieve. Only the pollen with
95% purity observed under the microscope were stored at -80°C
until used.

Pollen crude extract preparation

Pollens were ground in liquid nitrogen and extracted in
phosphate buffer saline (PBS) buffer containing 1 mM Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) with continuous stirring at
4°C for 1 h. The extract was centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 15
min and supernatant was collected before filtered through 0.45
micron filter. Protein concentration was determined using
Bradford’s assay. The efficacy and safety of this extract has been
previously reported.*

Electro-elution of 29-30 kDa IgE bound pollen protein
Electro-elution was carried out using electro-eluter (BioRad, USA). The preparative gels were carried in parallel with
gels for immunoblot to ensure that correct protein bands were
excised. The protocol was followed the instruction from the
manufacturer. Twenty yg of pollen protein extract was loaded
per well and resolved in 12% SDS-PAGE gel. This preparative

 

APJAI

gel was prepared with the same percentage and running
condition as the gels prepared for immunoblot. Coomassie
G-250 stained protein band matched IgE bound protein
band of immunoblot was excised and placed in glass tube
connected with pre-soaked membrane cap (3.5 kDa MWCO)
where eluted protein was retained. The assembled glass tube
was filled with elution buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.2, 192
mM glycine and 0.1% (w/v) SDS) and placed into a tube
holder. The holder was placed in buffer tank of Mini Transblot
Electrophoresis Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad, USA) and protein
was eluted from gel at a constant current of 8 mA/glass tube
for 3-4 h. Eluted protein retained in the membrane cap was
transferred and stored at -20°C. Analysis by SDS-PAGE gel and
immunoblot were done to confirm its IgE binding activity
before used in all IgE inhibition tests.

Identification of Major IgE bound protein by Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrophotometry (LC-MS/MS)

The following protocol was done per gel piece of one
protein band. An excised gel piece was submerged in buffer A
[50% Acetonitrile (ACN), 50 mM NH,HCO,] until colorless.
The buffer A was replaced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)
and incubated for 15 min at 60°C before was added with
buffer B (55 mM iodoacetamide, 50 mM NH,HCO,) and
incubated for 30 min at room temperatue in the dark. The
100% ACN was replaced to dry gel before adding trypsin
solution [0.lmg/mL trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 50 mM
Ammonium bicarbonate] and incubated at 37°C overnight.
The reaction was mixed with ACN at 1:1 (v/v) ratio and
incubated for 20 min. All solution was transferred to a new
tube and dried in centrifugal concentrator at 45°C. Resolved
pellet in 0.1% formic acid was injected into an Ultimate 3000
nano-LC system (Dionex; Surrey, U.K.) coupled with MicroToF Q II mass spectrometer (Bruker; Bremen, Germany). The
mass spectra data were acquired using Hystar software (Bruker
Daltonics, Germany) and were converted by Compass DataAnalysis software (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). The converted
files were analyzed with Mascot server (version 2.3.0, Matrix
Science, USA) to search matched sequence in NCBI database
with 95% confidence.

Direct IgE binding and Inhibition of IgE ELISA

Pollen extracts were coated at 500 ng/well of a 96-well
microtiter plate and incubated at 4°C overnight. The coated
plate was washed and incubated with 1/4-1/20 diluted serum
of SPT positive patients and control for 2h and washed before
incubated with HRP-labeled mouse IgG anti-human IgE
for 1 h. HRP substrate TMB (3,3’5,5-tetramethylbenzidine)
was added and blue color reaction product was read at a
wavelength of 650 nm.

For inhibition ELISA, 500 ng of eluted 30 kDa beta
-expansin (ExpB) of BGP extract was coated per well. Pre
-determined diluted sera of patients and control were
incubated with 0.5, 1, 10, and 20 ug/ml of eluted ExpB (29-30
kDa protein) of BGP (CD29), JGP (SH29), and PGP (BM30),
for overnight at 4°C before was centrifuged at 17,210 x g for
10 min at room temperature (RT). The supernatant was added
to coated wells and followed the mentioned direct ELISA
protocol.

Direct IgE Immunoblot and IgE inhibition immunoblot

Sera of patients and control were diluted at 1/10-1/50 in
PBS containing 3% skimmed milk (buffer A) and used in the
following tests.

For direct IgE immunoblot, 2 ug of pollen protein extract
were resolved per well of 12% SDS-PAGE gel at constant
current. Separated proteins in the gel were electro-transferred
onto nitrocellulose membrane before incubated in buffer A
for 1 h at RT. The membrane was washed with PBS containing
0.2% v/v tween-20 (buffer B) before incubated overnight at
4°C with diluted sera of patients and control in buffer A. The
membrane was washed with buffer B and was incubated with
1:10,000 diluted horse-radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated
mouse IgG anti-human IgE antibody (KPL, MD, USA) in
buffer A for 1 h. After washing, the membrane was incubated
with HRP substrate (Millipore, MA, USA) and emitted signal
was captured by x-ray film.

For IgE inhibition immunoblot, 1/50 diluted sera of patients
and control were incubated with 20 yg of eluted ExpB for
overnight at 4°C before was centrifuged at 17,210 x g for 10
min at RT. The supernatant was incubated with nitrocellulose
membrane on which had transferred CD29, SH29, and BM30,

for 2 h at RT and the remained steps were the same as those of
direct immunoblot.

Results

Nine patients with AR were included in this study based
on positive SPT to at least 2 of 3 extracts (Table 1). The mean
age of patients was 26.3 + 12.3 years. The severity of allergic
rhinitis was not different between patients who had low or
high specific IgE. Thus, all included patients were classified
as mild persistent allergic rhinitis. All patients had positive
SPT to BGP extract while 8 of 9 had positive SPT to JGP
extract (Table 1). However, only 6 of 9 patients had positive
to PGP pollen extract. The MWD of SPT to extract of BGP,
JGP, and PGP, were 5.8 mm, 3.8 mm, and 3 mm, respectively.
The results of ImmunoCAP showed all patients had sIgE > 0.35
kUA/L to BGP extract while 8 patients had sIgE > 0.35 KUA/L
to JPG extract (Table 1).

To further determine profiles of IgE bound pollen proteins
extracted from 3 grasses of all included patients, the results
showed that 8 profiles had IgE bound protein mobilized
between 25 and 37 kDa markers (Figure 1). One profile (Pt33)
could not be determined due to a lack of serum. Two profiles

(Pt29 & Pt39) show IgE bound multiple proteins of 3 grass

IgE bound multiple proteins of 1 grass mobilized 37-50 kDa
markers (Figure 1). Moreover, three profiles (Pt17, Pt39 &
Pt47) showed IgE bound multiple proteins of 3 grass mobilized
10-20 kDa markers (Figure 1). Based on these IgE bound
protein profiles, protein mobilized between 25-37 kDa appears
to be a major allergen among the 3 grass and was subjected for
LC-MS to identify its identity.

The results of LC-MS/MS showed that 2 excised proteins
(CD29, 30) of BGP extract matched 5-7 peptides of ExpB or
Cyn d 1 (Table 2). Excised protein of JPG (SH29) and PGP
(BM29, 30) extract matched 2-5 peptides of expansin B1 of
corn (Zea mays) (Table 2). Moreover, the sequence of BM30
also matched 4 peptides of expansin B9 of japanese rice
(Oryza sativa subsp. japonica) (Table 2). These results suggested
that a protein of ExpB family is the major allergen of BGP,
JGP, and PGP, sensitized by Thai AR patients. To confirm

(Figure 3).

Discussion

This is the first study to report that ExpB of BGP, JGP,
and PGP, is major IgE cross-reactive allergen for grass pollen
allergic Thai AR patients. It has been reported that ExpB
or Cyn d 1 of BGP appears to be major grass pollen allergen
in many subtropical areas.’ The Cyn d 1 cross-inhibited sIgE
binding to ExpB of subtropical Bahia grass (Pas n 1) with
strong affinity while to that of temperate Ryegrass (Lol p 1)
with moderate affinity.*° The difference in IgE affinity to
group 1 allergen of subtropical grass and temperate grass
may be caused by different subfamily. In subtropical grasses,
Bermuda is in Chloridoideae subfamily while both Johnson
and Para are in Panicoideae subfamily. Both subfamilies are
from the same lineage (PACMAD clade) in phylogenic tree
and ExpB of the 2 subfamilies shared 65% identity of amino
acid sequence. Based on the LC-MS results, identical amino
acid sequences between ExpB of BGP and PGP are WGAIWR
and LKGPFSIR, located in the C-terminal domain of Cyn d
1.°° Moreover, the peptide, WGAIWR (aa194-199) was showed

to be one of major IgG4 binding sites on Cyn d 1.’ Despite a
moderate sequence identity, ExpB of these 3 grass pollens
could cross-inhibit sIgE to ExpB with strong affinity (IC,, of 6
ug/ml). It has been reported that IgE cross-reactivity between
group 1 of subtropical grass and that of temperate grass could
also trigger allergic reaction in patients from either subtropical
or temperate regions.'*"' Based on these results, thus, ExpB of
one grass species, such as Cyn d 1, could be a good allergen
used in diagnosis and immunotherapy of AR patients who
sensitize to subtropical grass pollens from grass of PACMAD
clade. Moreover, several agricultural crops, such as maize,
sorghum, sugar cane, and pearl millet, are belonged to the
same Panicoideae subfamily as Johnson and Para grass. Thus,
investigation of IgE cross-reactivity of ExpB in pollens from
mentioned agricultural crops would be essential because they
are economically important crops for countries in warm regions
and many field workers may likely suffer pollen-caused AR?
Results of SPT and ImmunoCAP appear to correlate well
as 7 of 9 patients had a value of sIgE against BGP and JGP
grass pollen 2 0.35 kKUA/L while had = 3 mm MWD in SPT.
However, the other 2 patients did not have all positive results
from both testes, for instance, Pt8 had SPT positive to both
BGP and JGP but sIgE to only BGP or, for Pt9, SPT positive
to BGP but sIgE to both BGP and JGP (Table 1). Although
values of sIgE and SPT of 7 patients indicated they are
allergic to proteins of BGP and JGP, however, values of these
2 tests may not predict results of one another. For instance,
Pt4 had SPT value of 8.5 mm to BGP and 4.5 mm to JGP,

 

34
Beta-Expansin a major cross-reactive allergen for allergic rhinitis patients SP»

 

while sIgE values were > 100 and 85.3 kUA/L to BGP and
JGP, respectively. In contrast, Pt7 had SPT value of 7.5 mm to
BGP and 3.5 mm to JGP, while sIgE values were 0.85 and 0.55
kUA/L to BGP and JGP, respectively. Based on these results,
it appears that SPT could be sufficient test to diagnose pollen
allergy as also reported by others.'*7'°!' Pollen extract in this
report was prepared from 95% purified pollens from identified
grass species.* Therefore, results from SPT and IgE reactivity
assays, such as ELISA, would be a result from allergens
interacting sIgE.'4710!!

In conclusion, ExpB of Bermuda, Johnson, and Para grass
pollens is the major cross-reactive allergen for Thai patients
with AR and could be one of essential components for diagnosis
of pollen allergy.

Lactobacillus plantarum induces genomic DNA-dependent and
TLR9-mediated elafin secretion from Caco-2 cells

Abstract

Background: Lactobacilli show anti-inflammatory effects in the human intestine, and their genomic DNA was identified
as one of the anti-inflammatory components. Increased levels of the natural protease inhibitor elafin in the intestine plays
an important role in protection against intestinal inflammation. However, there have been no previous reports regarding
whether lactobacilli increase elafin levels.

Objective: This study was performed to investigate whether Lactobacillus plantarum induces elafin secretion from the
human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line, Caco-2. Moreover, we examined the roles of bacterial genomic DNA
and toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), a specific receptor of bacterial DNA, in this effect.

Methods: Elafin secretion from Caco-2 cells by live and heat-killed L. plantarum was measured. The analysis was also
performed using DNase-treated L. plantarum and genomic DNA extracted from L. plantarum. We examined the role of
TLR9 in elafin secretion by L. plantarum and its genomic DNA by suppressing TLR9 expression using RNAi in Caco-2 cells.

Results: Heat-killed L. plantarum time- and dose-dependently increased elafin secretion, whereas live L. plantarum had no
such effect. The elafin secretion by heat-killed L. plantarum was partially abolished by DNase treatment of the bacterium.
In addition, L. plantarum genomic DNA also increased elafin secretion. Furthermore, suppression of TLR9 expression
partially or completely abolished elafin secretion by heat-killed L. plantarum and its genomic DNA.

Conclusion: Our results indicated that heat-killed L. plantarum induced genomic DNA-dependent and TLR9-mediated
elafin secretion. The anti-inflammatory effects of lactobacilli may be mediated by increases in the levels of elafin in the

intestine.

Introduction

Lactobacilli, which are normal components of the human
gut microflora, have been used as both foods and medicines
because of their beneficial effects on the health of the host.
For example, treatment with lactobacilli has been reported to
ameliorate human intestinal inflammation in patients with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).' The genomic DNA, double
-stranded RNA, and cell wall components of lactobacilli have
been identified as components responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects.** Specifically, there have been a number of

reports regarding the anti-inflammatory effects of genomic DNA from lactobacilli.*° Rachmilewitz et al. reported that
intragastric administration of probiotic medical food VSL#3°
(VSL Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), which consists of eight strains
of lactic acid bacteria including lactobacilli, ameliorated the
severity of colitis in a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced
mouse model of IBD, whereas DNase-treated VSL#3° had
no effect.5 They also demonstrated that VSL#3° had no effect
on the severity of DSS-induced colitis in mice deficient for

toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), which is a specific receptor of
bacterial DNA” and has been reported to play a role in one
of the major pathways responsible for the anti-inflammatory
effects of genomic DNA from lactobacilli.°* Taken together,
these observations suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects
of lactobacilli are mediated by their genomic DNA, and TLR9
signaling is essential for these anti-inflammatory effects.

IBD, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are
chronic inflammatory disorders of the intestine. Although
the etiology of IBD has yet to be determined, a number of
mediators seem to play prominent roles in the pathogenesis
of chronic inflammatory disorders. Recent studies have highlighted the roles of proteases and their endogenous inhibitors in the pathogenesis of enteritis.''’* Elevated proteolytic
activities of several proteases have been detected in the
intestinal tissues of IBD patients.'' This increased proteolytic
activity may result from decreased efficacy and expression of
endogenous protease inhibitors.’? These results suggest that
the shift of protease/anti-protease balance toward a more
proteolytic environment causes chronic inflammation in the
intestine. Among the endogenous protease inhibitors, elafin
is a natural inhibitor of the human neutrophil proteases, elastase and proteinase 3.'*'° Elafin is mainly secreted from the
epithelial cells of various tissues, including the intestine,!” and
exerts anti-inflammatory effects by protease inhibition and by
restoring barrier function to damaged epithelial cells in the
intestine. The expression of elafin was downregulated in the
intestinal tissues of IBD patients, and this was associated with
increased elastase activity.'* In addition, a previous study using
transgenic mice expressing human elafin demonstrated that
an increased level of human elafin in the intestine re-equilibrates the protease/anti-protease balance and prevents intestinal inflammation in DSS- and trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid
(TNBS)-induced mouse models of IBD.'? These observations
suggest that an increased level of elafin in the intestine may be
useful in the treatment of IBD.

In the present study, we hypothesized that lactobacilli may
increase elafin secretion from intestinal epithelial cells, as
both lactobacilli and increased levels of elafin are involved in
intestinal anti-inflammatory effects. In this context, Motta et
al. engineered recombinant human elafin-expressing lactic
acid bacteria, including lactobacilli, and demonstrated that oral
administration of these recombinant bacteria ameliorates the
symptoms of inflammation in DSS-induced murine colitis."
However, the increase in elafin by lactobacilli in the intestine
has not been characterized in rodent studies, because a rodent
homolog of human elafin has not been identified. Therefore, we
examined elafin secretion from the human epithelial colorectal
adenocarcinoma cell line, Caco-2, a model of human intestinal
epithelial cells, induced by Lactobacillus plantarum, which is
widely used in the food industry due to its metabolic versatility,
and it has been reported to show anti-inflammatory effects
both in vitro and in vivo.'*"° To elucidate the molecular basis
underlying the upregulation of elafin secretion by L. plantarum,
we examined the roles of the bacterial genomic DNA and TLR9
in this effect.

Methods
Bacterial strain and culture conditions

L. plantarum strain D2905 was used in this study.” The
bacterium was grown at 27 °C, the optimal temperature for its
culture, in MRS medium under static conditions. To produce
heat-killed L. plantarum, an overnight culture was inoculated
into MRS medium to an optical density at 600 nm (OD,,,) of
0.05 and grown for 8 h. After centrifugation (7,000 x g, 15 min,
4 °C) and two washes with PBS, the bacterium was incubated
for 10 min at 65 °C. The bacterium was killed by this incubation (bacterial viability: 0.001%). This heat-killed bacterial
preparation was used without centrifugation and washing in
the following experiments. Furthermore, DNase-treated heatkilled L. plantarum was prepared by incubation with 5 ug/mL
DNase I (Roche) for 16 h at 37 °C.

Preparation of genomic DNA from L. plantarum

Genomic DNA was extracted from an overnight culture of
L. plantarum using a Gentra Puregene Yeast/Bact. Kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The concentration
and purity of genomic DNA preparation were confirmed by
measuring OD,,., and OD, 65580 and OD, 5/530 ratios, respectively. Only genomic DNA with OD,,,,,,, > 1-8 and OD,,,,,.,, > 2.0
was used for the experiments. Purified genomic DNA was tested
for endotoxin contamination using Limulus Amebocyte Lysate
QCL-1000 (Lonza).

Measurement of elafin secretion by L. plantarum

Caco-2 cells were used as described previously.° Aliquots of
2 x 10° Caco-2 cells were plated in each well of 24-well plates
(Nunc). Cells were treated with three concentrations of live or
heat-killed L. plantarum (1, 2, and 5 x 10° CFU/mL) for 12, 24,
and 48 h. After incubation, cell supernatants were centrifuged at
15,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. The concentration of elafin in the
cell supernatants was determined using a human elafin ELISA
kit (R & D Systems).

Measurement of elafin secretion by transfected L. plantarum
genomic DNA

Aliquots of 2 x 10° Caco-2 cells were plated in each well
of 24-well plates. Subsequently, 5 uL of L. plantarum genomic
DNA (0.35, 0.7, and 1.7 mg/mL) was added to 245 uL of
minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 1% fetal
bovine serum (Biowest). The genomic DNA solution was then
added to 250 wL of medium containing 1.25 uL of siLentFect
Lipid Reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and incubated for 30 min
at room temperature to produce the transfection mix. Caco-2
cells were transfected with the transfection mix for 12, 24,
and 48 h. After incubation, elafin secretion was measured by
ELISA as described above. As the genome size of L. plantarum is
approximately 3 Mbp, 1, 2, and 5 x 10° CFU/mL of L. plantarum
contain approximately 3.5, 7, and 17 yg/mL of genomic DNA,
respectively. Therefore, we used these three concentrations of
genomic DNA (3.5, 7, and 17 ug/mL) in this experiment.

Transfection of Caco-2 cells with TLR9-siRNA

TLR9 expression in Caco-2 cells was suppressed by RNAi,
as described previously.” Briefly, aliquots of 2 x 10° Caco-2 cells
plated in 24-well plates were transfected with 50 nM TLR9

-siRNA or scramble TLR9-siRNA (Bonac Corp.) as a negative
control using siLentFect Lipid Reagent. After incubation for
24 h, the cells were treated with heat-killed L. plantarum (5 x
10° CFU/ml) or transfected with L. plantarum genomic DNA
(17 pg/mL) for 48 h as described above. The cell supernatants
were collected, and the cellular protein extracts from Caco-2
cells were prepared with PRO-PREP Protein Extraction Solution (iNtRON Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. The concentration of elafin in the cell supernatants
was determined by ELISA. Suppression of TLR9 expression in
the protein extracts of cells transfected with TLR9-siRNA, but
not scramble TLR9-siRNA, was confirmed by Western blotting
using an antibody to TLR9 as described previously.°

Detection of intracellular translocated genomic DNA

Aliquots of 2 x 10° Caco-2 cells were plated in each well
of 24-well plates and treated with heat-killed L. plantarum (5
x 10° CFU/ml) or L. plantarum genomic DNA (17 pg/mL) for
various times (0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 24, and 48 h). After treatment,
Caco-2 cells were trypsinized using trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen)
at 37 °C for 10 min. The cells were then collected and centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 5 min and washed five times with PBS.
DNA was extracted from Caco-2 cells using ISOGEN (Nippon
Gene) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Detection of
intracellular genomic DNA was performed by PCR based on the
L. plantarum-specific 16S rRNA gene.° PCR was performed
using KOD FX Neo (Toyobo) in 30-uL reaction mixtures containing 1 ug of DNA preparation and the following primers:
sense 5’-TGGTATTGATTGGTGCTTGCA-3’ and anti-sense
5’-CCACCTTCCTCCGGTTTGTCA-3. PCR products were
subjected to 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis.

Statistical analysis

Data are presented as means + standard deviations. Statistical analyses were performed using Origin Pro 8.1 (OriginLab).
In all analyses, P < 0.05 was taken to indicate significance.

Results
Increase in elafin secretion by heat-killed L. plantarum
Treatment with heat-killed L. plantarum (5 x 10° CFU/
ml) significantly increased elafin secretion from Caco-2 cells,
reaching 0.84 ng/mL after 48 h of treatment (P < 0.01 vs.
medium alone by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test)
(Figure 1A). In contrast, elafin secretion remained close to the
background level after 48 h of treatment with live L. plantarum.
Therefore, heat-killed L. plantarum was used in the following
experiments. As shown in Figure 1B, treatment for 48 h with
heat-killed L. plantarum at 2 and 5 x 10° CFU/mL significantly
increased elafin secretion from Caco-2 cells compared to medium alone (0.38 and 0.84 ng/mL vs. 0.10 ng/mL, respectively;
P<0.01, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test). In contrast,
there was no significant difference in elafin secretion between
cells treated with 1 x 10° CFU/mL heat-killed L. plantarum
and medium alone. These results indicated that heat-killed L.
plantarum increased elafin secretion in a time- and dose-dependent manner.

Decrease in heat-killed L. plantarum-induced elafin secretion
by DNase treatment

Treatment with DNase-treated and non-treated heat-killed
L. plantarum significantly increased the level of elafin secretion
from Caco-2 cells compared with medium alone (1.18 and
0.54 ng/mL vs. 0.20 ng/mL, respectively; P < 0.01, one-way
ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test). However, the level of
elafin secretion in cells treated with DNase-treated heat-killed
L. plantarum was significantly lower than that in cells treated
with non-treated heat-killed L. plantarum (P < 0.05) (Figure
2). These observations indicated that DNase treatment partially abolished the increase in elafin secretion by heat-killed
L. plantarum, although we could not exclude the possibility that
DNase caused the decrease in elafin secretion by heat-killed L.
plantarum regardless of the DNase activity.

and 0.33 ng/mL vs. 0.07 ng/ml, respectively; P < 0.01, one-way
ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test). In contrast, no significant
change in elafin secretion was observed in those transfected
with 3.5 ug/mL of genomic DNA compared to controls. These
results indicated that L. plantarum genomic DNA increased
elafin secretion in a time- and dose-dependent manner.

Mediation of TLR9 on elafin secretion by heat-killed L. plantarum and its genomic DNA

TLR9-siRNA-transfected Caco-2 cells showed decreased
TLR9 expression compared to siRNA non-transfected and
scramble TLR9-siRNA-transfected cells as a negative control
(Figure 4A). This observation confirmed that TLR9-siRNA
suppressed TLR9 expression in Caco-2 cells. Treatment with
heat-killed L. plantarum significantly increased the level of
elafin secretion in non-transfected cells, scramble TLR9-siRNA
-transfected cells, and TLR9-siRNA-transfected cells (0.74, 0.80,
and 0.39 ng/mL, respectively). On the other hand, treatment
with L. plantarum genomic DNA significantly increased elafin
secretion in non-transfected cells and scramble TLR9-siRNA
-transfected cells (0.33 and 0.35 ng/mL, respectively), but the
genomic DNA had no such effect in TLR9-siRNA-transfected
cells (0.09 ng/mL). In addition, the levels of elafin secretion
in TLR9-siRNA-transfected cells treated with heat-killed L.
plantarum and L. plantarum genomic DNA were significantly
lower than those in non-transfected cells and scramble TLR9
-siRNA-transfected cells (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively;
two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test) (Figure 4B). These
observations indicated that suppression of TLR9 expression
partially or completely abolished elafin secretion by heat-killed
L. plantarum and its genomic DNA, respectively.

Intracellular translocation of L. plantarum genomic DNA

Intracellular translocation of the genomic DNA was a prerequisite for recognition by TLR9, because TLR9 is localized in

the endosome and lysosome.” Therefore, we examined whether L. plantarum genomic DNA can be translocated into Caco-2
cells. L. plantarum genomic DNA was detected within Caco-2
cells at 3-24 h after treatment with heat-killed L. plantarum,
and the genomic DNA was also detected within cells at 1-24 h
after treatment (Figure 5). No L. plantarum genomic DNA was
detected within cells following treatment with medium alone.

Discussion
The results of the present study indicated that treatment

with heat-killed L. plantarum increased the level of elafin secretion from Caco-2 cells, which was partially dependent on the
bacterial genomic DNA. Moreover, TLR9 was shown to be the
primary mediator of elafin secretion by heat-killed L. plantarum
and its genomic DNA. To our knowledge, this is the first report
regarding induction of elafin secretion from intestinal epithelial
cells by lactobacilli and the molecular mechanisms underlying
this effect.

Over the past several decades, lactobacilli have been reported to show anti-inflammatory effects and have been used

 
Elafin secretion by L. plantarum SP»
APJAI

 

to treat patients with IBD.' Increased elafin levels have been
shown to play an important role in intestinal anti-inflammatory effects.'*!* However, there have been no previous reports
of increases in elafin levels induced by lactobacilli in the
intestine. As elafin production has not been characterized in
rodents, we examined whether lactobacilli could increase
the level of elafin in the intestine using Caco-2 cells, and our
results indicated that heat-killed L. plantarum increased elafin
secretion from Caco-2 cells (Figure 1). These observations
suggested that orally administered lactobacilli may increase
elafin levels in the intestines of IBD patients. As the protease/
anti-protease imbalance due to downregulation of elafin was
shown to be involved in chronic inflammation in the intestine
of IBD patients,''™ the increase in elafin levels by lactobacilli
in the intestine may lead to re-equilibration of the protease/
anti-protease balance and subsequently ameliorate inflammation in these patients. On the other hand, live L. plantarum
had no effect on elafin secretion (Figure 1), although live
actobacilli therapy has been reported to ameliorate human
BD.' In general, orally administered live lactobacilli cannot
survive in the low pH gastric environment, and the secretion of
lysozymes, bile acid, and pancreatic fluid in the duodenum also
influence the viability of the lactobacilli.*** Consequently, the
actobacilli would be killed by these conditions prior to reaching
the intestine. Thus, it is possible that orally administered live
actobacilli are killed, and then increase elafin secretion from
juman intestinal epithelial cells.

Genomic DNA has been identified as the principle antiinflammatory component of lactobacilli.°” Therefore, we hypothesized that the increase in elafin secretion by heat-killed
L. plantarum depends on its genomic DNA. In the present
study, DNase treatment partially abolished the increase in
elafin secretion by heat-killed L. plantarum (Figure 2). Moreover, L. plantarum genomic DNA increased elafin secretion
from Caco-2 cells, although to a lesser extent than heat-killed
L. plantarum (Figures 1 and 3). These results indicated that
the increase in elafin secretion by L. plantarum is partially
mediated by its own genomic DNA and suggested that lactobacilli may exert anti-inflammatory effects through genomic
DNA-dependent elafin secretion from epithelial cells in the
human intestine. These observations also suggested that bacterial components other than genomic DNA may also be involved
in the increase in elafin secretion by heat-killed L. plantarum.
Previous studies showed that dsRNA and cell wall components are also anti-inflammatory components of lactobacilli.“
Therefore, the increase in elafin secretion by heat-killed L.
plantarum may be related not only genomic DNA but also to
these other bacterial components.

The anti-inflammatory effects of lactobacilli genomic DNA
are primarily mediated by TLR9 signaling.*® Consistent with
this, suppression of TLR9 completely abolished the increase in
elafin secretion by L. plantarum genomic DNA in the present
study (Figure 4). These observations indicated that TLR9 signaling is a major pathway responsible for the induction of elafin
secretion by L. plantarum genomic DNA. However, suppression
of TLR9 only partially abolished the increase in elafin secretion by heat-killed L. plantarum, suggesting that TLR9 is one,
but not the only, mediator of elafin secretion by heat-killed L.
plantarum. As bacterial components other than genomic DNA,

 

 

including dsRNA and cell wall components, may be involved
in the upregulation of elafin secretion by heat-killed L. plantarum, the receptors for these bacterial components (ie., TLR3
and TLR2)?5”6 may also partially regulate these effects. Further
studies are required to fully elucidate the molecular mechanism
of elafin secretion by heat-killed L. plantarum.

Overproduction of inflammatory cytokines results in the
development of inflammation in the intestine. In fact, the
levels of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-8 have
been shown to be increased in the intestine of IBD patients.”
Therefore, it is important to examine IL-8 secretion in
assessment of the level of inflammation in the intestine. Our
previous study indicated that genomic DNA of lactobacilli
decreased H,O,-induced IL-8 secretion from Caco-2 cells.’
In addition, we identified an oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN),
which markedly decreased H,0,-induced IL-8 secretion, from
the genomic DNA of L. casei, and demonstrated that oral
administration of this anti-inflammatory ODN to mice ameliorated DSS-induced murine colitis.?' Therefore, suppression
of IL-8 secretion in vitro is an important factor for ameliorating colitis in this in vivo model of IBD. In our preliminary
study, we found that heat-killed L. plantarum and its genomic
DNA decreased H,O,-induced IL-8 secretion from Caco-2
cells without inducing a pro-inflammatory response (data not
shown). These observations suggested the possibility of an
anti-inflammatory effect in an in vivo model of IBD by
heat-killed L. plantarum and its genomic DNA. On the other
hand, we also showed previously that suppression of TLR9
expression by RNAi abolished the decrease in H,O,-induced
IL-8 secretion by lactobacilli genomic DNA and the antiinflammatory ODN.*”! These observations indicated that the
TLR9 signaling pathway plays a major role in mediating the
decrease in IL-8 secretion. However, at present, we cannot
explain the mechanism by which activation of the TLR9
signaling pathway results in the observed decrease in IL-8
secretion. The results of the present study indicated that L.
plantarum genomic DNA increased elafin secretion from
Caco-2 cells through TLR9 (Figures 3 and 4). Therefore, the
increase in elafin levels may play important roles in the
reduction of IL-8 secretion by lactobacilli genomic DNA,
likely due to inhibition of pro-inflammatory proteases and
restoration of barrier function to damaged epithelial cells.
Further studies of the increase in elafin levels may elucidate the
mechanism by which the TLR9 signaling pathway induces the
observed anti-inflammatory effects.

TLR9 is expressed in human epithelial cells, including
Caco-2 cells, and is localized in the endosome and lysosome.”
The bacterial genomic DNA must undergo translocation into
Caco-2 cells to be recognized by TLR9. However, bacterial genomic DNA cannot translocate into mammalian cells because
of its high molecular weight and hydrophilicity. Therefore,
translocation of DNA into eukaryotic cells has generally been
performed using transfection reagents, such as liposomes. In
the present study, we confirmed that L. plantarum genomic
DNA translocated into Caco-2 cells in the presence (Figure
5), but not in the absence (data not shown), of transfection
reagent. However, translocation of genomic DNA was also
observed in Caco-2 cells treated with heat-killed L. plantarum.
At present, we cannot explain these observations. Previous

studies showed that L. plantarum produces a major polyamine,
putrescine,* and that polyamines form a complex with and
stabilize the DNA. This complex subsequently forms nanoparticles and is subsequently readily translocated into eukaryotic
cells.”°° One possible explanation for the translocation of
genomic DNA into Caco-2 cells treated with heat-killed L.
plantarum is that the genomic DNA and polyamine contained
in heat-killed L. plantarum may form such a complex, thus
facilitating translocation of the genomic DNA into Caco-2 cells
due to the transfection effect of the polyamine.

Conclusion

The results of the present study indicated that heat-killed
L. plantarum increased the level of elafin secretion from Caco2 cells, and the bacterial genomic DNA and TLR9 play crucial
roles in this effect. Lactobacilli therapy is useful for the treatment of IBD, although the underlying mechanisms are not
fully understood. Our observations suggest that one possible
mechanism for the efficacy of lactobacilli therapy may involve
an increase in elafin levels in the intestine. Further studies
of the elafin induction associated with lactobacilli and their
genomic DNA may lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches to ameliorate intestinal inflammation.

Abstract

Background: There have been a few studies aimed at identifying epitopes of ADCC-inducing antibodies when compared
to those of neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic T lymphocytes against a variety of HIV-1 clades.

Objective: To map the common ADCC epitopes of HIV-1 CRFO1_AE.

Methods: We screened 65 sera of confirmed early HIV-1 CRFO1_AE infected individuals for ADCC antibody against
gp120 utilizing an EGFP-CEM-NK' flow cytometric assay. Sera with high ADCC antibody were then examined against
ADCC epitopes using the complete HIV-1 CRF01_AE gp160- and subtype A Gag-overlapping peptide sets which were
divided into 7 pools:E1-E7 and 5 pools:G1-G5, respectively. Each positive peptide pool was further investigated for fine
ADCC epitope mapping using matrix formats.

Results: Twenty, 25 and 20 sera demonstrated the high-, medium- and low-ADCC antibody activities against gp120,
respectively. Interestingly, 11 Env- and 6 Gag-peptides of pools E3, E4, E7 and pools Gl, G2, G4 with high ADCC
responses were also responded by at least 20%, 12% and 5%, 10% of medium- and low-ADCC antibody sera, respectively.
These eleven common Env ADCC epitopes were localized at C2-V3-C3-V4 regions of gp120 and cytoplasmic tail of gp41
while six common Gag ADCC epitopes were localized at p17-p24-p2 regions.

Conclusions: Although the degree of ADCC antibody responses to the gp120 protein varied from high to low, there were
certain consensus Env and Gag peptides that could induce the ADCC antibody responses of 21.54-58.46% and 23.0841.54%, respectively of the early infected individuals. This epitope information should be useful as the new antibody-based
vaccine immunogens.

Introduction

The development of effective HIV-1 vaccines is urgently
required for controlling future spread of HIV-1.' Current
prophylaxis HIV-1 vaccine trials are based on both arms of
immune responses, i.e. humoral and cellular immunity.
However, each arm has not yet been successful.* Antibody
dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) is a cytolytic

mechanism of natural killer (NK) cells against virus-infected
cells by combining of the innate and adaptive immunity. The
mechanism of ADCC can be stimulated by the interaction of
specific antibody bound to HIV-1 antigens on the infected
cells and Fc receptor CD16 (FcyRIIIa) expressed on the surface
of NK cells. Activation of NK cells lead to lysis of target cells.’

ADCC responses have been reported to correlate with the
control or limit viremia during acute HIV-1 infection and
help to slow the progression of disease in both HIV-1 infected
individuals and SIV infected macaques.*® Of the six HIV-1
efficacy trials, the RV144 prime-boost regimen phase III trial
has provided evidence of vaccine-induced 31.2% protection.’
Vaccinees who showed significantly low risk of HIV-1 infection
demonstrated the high level of ADCC antibody responses.°

In the clinical course of HIV-1 infection, the acute phase
of infection reveals an initial high peak of plasma viremia
and decreased number of CD4* T lymphocytes.’ In addition,
expansion of inefficient HIV-1-specific CD8* T cells during
acute infection has recently been reported.' Finding of the
early effective immune responses against transmitted virus
in acute HIV-1 infection may give a chance to control initial
viremia, prolong HIV-1 disease progression, decrease immune
cell damage and prevent transmission.’ Identification of the
common epitopes of HIV-1 that could respond to ADCC
antibody of sera with low-, medium- or high-ADCC against
envelope protein at the early phase would be an important new
information that can be utilized for vaccine development. Here
we have identified common ADCC antibody epitopes of Env
and Gag of HIV-1 CRF01_AE using sera of confirmed early
HIV-1 infected individuals.

Methods
Volunteer samples

All sera samples from young Thai men who were enrolled to
the conscripts during year 2001-2013 were obtained with written informed consents following approval from Institutional
Review Board (IRB) of Royal Thai Army Medical Department
(Code: S034b/57) and IRB of the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj
Hospital (COA: Si609/2014) prior to initiation of this study. The
sera samples obtained had no individual identifiers. These sera
were confirmed as early HIV-1 infection by using the Aware™
BED™ EIA HIV-1 Incidence Test (Calypte Co., Portland, OR,
USA).

Cell line
The NK cell resistant, EGFP-CEM-NK' cells were cultured
and prepared for the assay as previously described."

Peptides

The gp120 of HIV-1 CRF01_AE CM243 (Protein Sciences,
Meriden, CT, USA) was used to pulse the EGFP-CEM-NK’
cells. In addition, the complete peptide set based on the HIV-1
CRFO1_AE Env TH023/CM240 sequence consists of 168
peptides (122 peptides of TH023 gp120 and 46 peptides of
TH023/CM240 gp41) each containing 15 amino acids (aa) in
length, overlapping by 11 aa. The 143 peptides of TH023 were
kindly provided by the Natural and Medical Sciences Institute
(University of TUbingen, Germany) and 25 peptides of CM240
were commercially synthesized (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ,
USA). These Env peptides were divided into seven pools:E1-E7,
each containing 24 peptides. To further identify the reactive
peptide, each informative peptide pool was again divided
into ten small pools according to the 5 by 5 matrix formats.
Moreover, Gag peptide set of HIV-1 subtype A sequence

consisting of 49 peptides each containing 20 aa in length,
overlapping by 10 aa was kindly provided by the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) AIDS reagent repository (catalog
#3991). These Gag peptides were divided into five pools:G1-G5,
each containing 9-10 peptides. Each pool was again divided into
three small pools as 3 by 3 matrix formats. Each peptide pool
was also used to pulse the EGFP-CEM-NK' cells.

Preparation of sera

All sera were from individuals infected with HIV-1 CRFO1
_AE as determined by C2-V4 nucleotide sequencing as
described elsewhere.’ A HIV-1 sero-negative pooled serum
and a sero-positive serum with high ADCC antibody activity
were used as controls with each assay. All sera were inactivated
at 56 °C for 30 min. prior to use and used at dilutions of 1:250,
1:2,500 and 1:25,000.

Target cells

The gp120- or peptide pool-pulsed EGFP-CEM-NK‘ target
cells were prepared by the addition of either 0.1 tg gp120 of
HIV-1 CRFO1_AE CM243 or 1 ug of each peptide pool to 1 x
10° target cells. The peptide and target cells were incubated for
1 h at room temperature. The gp120 pulsed cells were washed
three times with phosphate buffered saline. The target cells
were then re-suspended in growth medium containing RPMI
1640 (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 2 mM
1-glutamine, 100 ug/ml streptomycin, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and
10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Gibco) at a concentration
of 1 x 10° cells/ml.

Effector cells

Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
were prepared from leukopaks of a single HIV-1 seronegative
blood donor as previously described." Cells were later thawed
and overlaid overnight at 1 x 10° cells/ml in growth medium
at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The cells were then re-suspended in
growth media at a concentration of 2.5 x 10° cells/ml and used
as effector cells.

EGFP-ADCC flow cytometric assay

The EGFP-ADCC flow cytometric assay was based on a
method previously described." Lysis of target cells by ADCC
activity was measured and analyzed with a FACScan flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson Biosciences {BDB}, San Jose,
CA, USA). The actual percent lysis of target cells at each serum
dilution was calculated as previously reported.’ The cut-off for
positive results using gp120- and peptide pool-pulsed target
cells are 7.21% lysis and 5.46% lysis, respectively.’

Results
Screening for high ADCC antibody activity against gp120
pulsed target cells

Sixty five confirmed early HIV-1 CRFO1_AE infected sera
were investigated for ADCC antibody activity against gp120
pulsed target cells. The percent lysis of target cells ranged
from 9.15 % to 56.12 % with mean and SD values of 24.08
and 10.72, respectively. Twenty, 25 and 20 sera demonstrated
the high (> 29.44% target cell lysis, > mean + 0.5SD), medium

(29.44-18.72% lysis, mean + 0.5SD) and low (< 18.72% lysis, <
mean-0.5SD) ADCC antibody activities, respectively.

Identification of HIV-1 CRF01_AE gp160- and Gag-epitopes
that are the target of ADCC reactive antibodies

Twenty sera with relatively high ADCC antibody activity
were further examined against each of the seven peptide
pools:E1-E7 of the HIV-1 CRF01_AE Env peptide set and
each of the five peptide pools:G1-G5 of HIV-1 subtype A Gag
formulated as described in the methods section. These 20 sera
demonstrated positive ADCC antibody responses against a
number of Env peptide pools while 18 sera responded against
Gag peptide pools as shown in Table 1. For Env peptide pools,
whereas sixteen (80%), fourteen (70%), and twelve (60%)
sera demonstrated significantly higher frequency of ADCC
responses against pools E7, E3 and E4, respectively, six to
ten (30-50%) of these sera showed significant but somewhat
lower frequency of ADCC responses to peptide pools E2, E1,
E6 and E5. Moreover, 9/20 (45%) of tested sera demonstrated
the responses to all three peptide pools: E3, E4, E7. In addition,
all tested sera responded to at least one of these three peptide
pools. Thus, a 5 by 5 matrix of each of the 3 peptide pools E3,
E4 and E7 was selected to perform the fine epitope mapping
of ADCC responses. The potential ADCC antibody epitopes
were identified by verifying the common peptides from this

matrix. The common peptides within pools E3, E4 and E7 that
responded to ADCC activity of each of the 20 tested sera are
shown in Table 2. Twelve potential ADCC antibody epitopes
with > 50% responses of all tested sera in each pool were
identified. For the parent E3 peptide pool, 9/14 (64.29%) and
7/14 (50%) sera showed ADCC activity against peptides (78,
83) and 71, respectively. For the parent E4 pool, 8/12 (66.67%),
7/12 (58.33%) and 6/12 (50%) of sera showed ADCC activity
against peptides 87, (84, 85, 95, 97) and (89, 92), respectively.
Moreover, 8/16 (50.00%) sera demonstrated ADCC activity
against peptides 190 and 191 from the parent E7 pool.

For Gag peptide pools, whereas fourteen (70%), twelve
(60%) and ten (50%) sera demonstrated significantly higher
frequency of ADCC antibody responses against pools G4, G2
and Gl, respectively, three to seven (15-35%) of these sera
showed significant but somewhat lower frequency of ADCC
responses to pools G3 and G5 (Table 1). In addition, 6/20
(30%) of tested sera recognized all three peptide pools: G1,
G2, G4. However, two sera (10%) did not respond to any pool of
Gag peptide. Thus, a 3 by 3 matrix of each of the 3 peptide pools
G1, G2 and G4 was selected to perform the fine epitope mapping
of ADCC responses. The common peptides within pools Gl,
G2 and G4 that responded to ADCC activity of each of the 18
sera tested are shown in Table 3. Six potential ADCC antibody
epitopes with > 50% responses of all tested sera in each pool

Twenty five medium- and 20 low-ADCC antibody sera were
examined for their responses to the 12 and 6 potential common

ADCC antibody epitopes of HIV-1 Env and Gag, respectively.
For Env protein, the range of 5/25 (20%) - 18/25 (72%) and 1/20
(5%) - 15/20 (75%) of medium- and low-ADCC antibody sera,
respectively demonstrated the responses to 11 common ADCC
epitopes (peptides 71, 78, 83, 84, 85, 87, 89, 92, 95, 190, 191); i.e.,
except peptide 97 (Table 4). The overall responses of 65 tested
sera against these peptides were > 20%, ie., 21.54% - 58.46%.

ADCC epitopes (peptides 3776, 3779, 3789, 3790, 3800, 3802)
(Table 5). The overall responses of 65 tested sera against these
peptides were > 20%, i.e., 23.08% - 41.54%. These 6 common
epitopes are localized within the p17, p24 and p2 regions of Gag
protein.

Discussion

In this study, sixty five sera of young Thai men who enrolled
to the conscripts were confirmed as sera from early HIV-1
CRFO1_AE infected individuals using the Aware™ BED™ EIA
HIV-1 Incidence Test (data not shown). Estimation of the mean
duration of recent infection (MDRI) was 198.4 days for BED."
All sera were screened for high-, medium- and low-ADCC
antibody activity against gp120 pulsed target cells utilizing an
EGFP-CEM-NK‘ flow cytometric assay. The gp120 was used
instead of gp160 because only HIV-1 CRFO1_AE gp120 is
commercially available. Our assay measures the number of
target cells that are killed."

Identification of potential ADCC antibody epitopes using a
matrix format led to the finding that the spectrum of peptide
specific reactivity varied for each serum tested. All tested sera
showed reactivity against a total of 1-37, and 1-18 peptides for
Env and Gag proteins, respectively (Tables 2, 3). Studies on
Env protein further showed that three epitopes (peptides 71,
78, 83) of pool E3, seven epitopes (peptides 84, 85, 87, 89, 92,
95, 97) of pool E4 and two epitopes (peptides 190, 191) of pool
E7 were identified as being targets of ADCC antibodies from
at least 50.00% of the tested sera (Table 2). Interestingly, all
these potential epitopes except peptide 97 could be able to gain
the responses from sera of medium- and low-ADCC activities
for at least 20% and 5%, respectively which made the overall
total responses to the range of 21.54-58.46% (Table 4). The aa
sequences of the 12 potential ADCC epitopes of HIV-1 CRFO1_
AE gp160 are also shown in Table 4. The common peptides 71,
78, and 83 are localized within the C2, V3, and V3-C3 regions
of gp120, respectively while the common peptides (84, 85, 87,

 

89, 92), 95 and 97 are localized within the C3, C3-V4 and V4
of gp120, respectively (Figure 1). In addition, the common
peptides 190 and 191 are in the cytoplasmic tail region of
gp41. Kijak et al. studied the molecular evolution of the HIV-1
epidemic among volunteers of RV144 vaccine trial from 2003
to 2009.'* They found that CRF01_AE strains were 31% more
diverse than the ones from the 1990s Thai epidemic. Thus,
HIV-1 CRFO1_AE strains that infected individuals in our
study should also be diverse since the sera were obtained
during 2001-2013. Interestingly, sera from these individuals
could be able to demonstrate ADCC antibody responses to
these common potent epitopes. This indicates that these ADCC
epitopes were quite conserved and immunodominant.

Moreover, peptides 78, 85 and 92 showed the responses
to ADCC activity at a larger number of sera of medium- and
low-ADCC response groups than those of a high-ADCC
response group, i.e., (72%, 55% vs 45%), (44%, 50% vs 35%),
(44%, 75% vs 30%), respectively. This revealed the importance
of these peptide sequences as the prominent ADCC epitopes
for induction of ADCC responses against Env peptides of
early HIV-1 infected individuals, ie., 58.46%, 43.08% and
49.23%, respectively, of total 65 tested sera (Table 4).

Kulkarni et al. reported that 5 out of 10 Indian long-term
non-progressors (LTNPs) demonstrated ADCC activity against
the target epitopes in Env-C V3 region (aa 288-330: LNESVEI
VCTRPNNNTRKSIRIGPGQTGDIIGDIRQAHC)."* They proposed the potential role of this anti-V3 ADCC response in
viral control which may contribute to the slower disease
progressors. Their epitope sequences included our full epitope
peptide 78 (aa 308-322: SINIGPGQVFYRTGD) and partial of
epitope peptide 71 (aa 290-294:...LNKSV). The V3 region is
one of the most immunogenic epitopes in the envelope which
the V3 crown composed of the highly conserved aa 1307,
1309 and F317 that can induce specific antibody in > 90% of
HIV infected individuals.'*’” V3-specific Abs from RV144
vaccinees were shown to capture infectious virions.'* Moreover,

Montefiori et al. demonstrated the high Nt antibody activity
against V3 peptide of HIV-1 CRF01_AE TH023 (aa 302-326:
SNNTRTSINIGPGQVFYRTGDHGD) from volunteer sera of
RV144 phase III trial.” The initial ADCC antibody response
to the V3 epitopes in our study may occur against the
founder virus in most of the early HIV-1 infected individuals.
However, the later consequence may depend on the efficiency of
each individual immune response. If one can control the virus
as in LTNP, the ADCC antibody against these epitopes should
be detectable for a longer time period. On the other hand,
the virus may mutate the V3 sequence to evade the immune
responses” and later ADCC antibody may be further adapted
to recognize the coming mutated V3 epitopes. Thus, the ADCC
antibody at the non-early phase would not be able to respond to
these original V3 epitopes as we previously reported on ADCC
epitopes of HIV-1 in asymptomatic infected individuals.’ Our
finding of peptide 85 (aa 336-350: GTIKWNEVLKKVTKKL) as
dominant ADCC epitope was also correspondent to the data
of Kulkarni et al.!* They demonstrated the recognition of novel
antigenic ADCC epitope in sera of LTNPs at the C3 region (aa
331-360: CNISEEKWNKTLQRVSEKLKEHFPNKTIKF).

The CD4-bound conformation of Env was recently shown
to be a major target of ADCC-mediating antibodies present in
the sera of HIV-1-infected individuals.” Prévost et al. reported
the influence of the envelope gp120 Phe 43 cavity on HIV-1
sensitivity to ADCC responses.” While residue $375 in the
gp120 Phe 43 cavity is well conserved in the majority of group
MHIV-1 isolates, CRFO1_AE strains have a naturally occurring
histidine at this position (H375). They demonstrated that the
H375 increases Env propensity to sample the CD4-bound
conformation, thus increasing susceptibility of HIV-1 infected
cells to ADCC. They raise the intriguing possibility that the
presence of His 375 in the circulating CRFO1_AE strain in
Thailand might have contributed to the efficacy of the trial
by spontaneously exposing epitopes recognized by ADCC
-mediating antibodies elicited by the RV144 vaccine regimen.
Our finding on peptide 92 (aa 364-378: PSGGDLEITMHHF
NC) with His 375 emphasized the immunodominant property
of this peptide as ADCC epitope since 49.23% of tested sera
showed the ADCC responses.

Tomaras et al. reported that the first anti-HIV-1 antibody
was the antibody against gp41 and appeared 13 days after
the appearance of plasma virus.”* In our study, the common
peptides 190 (aa 708-722: LSFQTPSHHQREPDR) and 191
(aa 712-726: TPSHHQREPDRPEGI) which are located in the
Kennedy sequence (KS) of cytoplasmic tail (CT) region of
gp41 showed the ability to induce ADCC antibody with the
total responses of 21.54% and 27.69%, respectively, of 65
tested sera (Table 4). This confirmed the study of Dimmock
et al. on the alternative topological model of CT sequence:
external localization. Moreover, anti-KE (Kennedy epitope)
serum that could specifically neutralize HIV in vitro implied
the localization of the KE on the outer surface of the virion.”
Abacioglu et al. revealed that the KS epitope PDRPEG was a
conformational epitope which could induce non-Nt antibody
(Chessie 8) binding to HIV-infected cells.” This indicated the
property of ADCC antibody inducible of our peptides as we
demonstrated in our study.

Identification of ADCC antibodies targeting conserved
non-Env proteins such as Gag may reveal more potent ADCC
activities. The appearance of HIV-core antigens on the surface
of infected cells has been shown for p17 and p24.”
Moreover, the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to p24-core
protein of HIV-1 have been demonstrated to mediate ADCC
activity to destroy infected cells.” Our studies on Gag protein
further demonstrated that two epitopes of each peptide pools
G1 (peptides 3776, 3779), G2 (peptide 3789, 3790) and G4
(peptides 3800, 3802) were identified as being targets of
ADCC antibodies from at least 50.00% of the sera tested
(Table 3). Interestingly, all these 6 epitopes could be able to gain
the responses from sera of medium- and low-ADCC activities
for at least 12% and 10%, respectively which made the overall
responses to the range of 23.08-41.54% (Table 5). The aa
sequences of the 6 potential ADCC epitopes of HIV-1 CRFO1_
AE Gag are also shown in Table 5. The common peptides
3776 and 3779 are localized within the p17 (MA, matrix)
region while the common peptides 3789, 3790 and 3800, 3802
are localized within the p24 (CA, capsid) region (Figure 1).
Our finding of peptide 3789 (aa 171-190: MFSALSEGATPQD
LNMMLNI) was correspondent to that of Grunow et al.”
They showed the recognition of p24-ADCC epitope (aa
178-187: GATPQDLNIM) expressed on the HIV-infected T
cells by mAbs. Interestingly, peptides 3779, 3800 and 3802
demonstrated the responses to ADCC activity at an almost
equal/higher number of sera of medium- and low-ADCC
response groups than those of a high-ADCC response group,
ie., (32%, 35% vs 35%), (32%, 45% vs 30%) and (52%, 40%
vs 30%), respectively. This revealed the important of these
peptide sequences as the dominant ADCC epitopes for
induction of ADCC responses against Gag peptides of early
HIV-1 infected individuals, i.e., 33.85%, 35.39% and 41.54%,
respectively, of total 65 tested sera. Genetic data support a
major role for the cytoplasmic tail of gp41 and the matrix
domain of Gag in Env glycoprotein incorporation.” Both
Gag and Env display properties of being associated with
lipid rafts at the plasma membrane. Gag-Env interactions
affect their co-recruitment to the virological synapse and
subsequent early events in the next round of viral replication.
The ADCC antibody against epitopes on matrix domain of
Gag demonstrated in our study may have an effect on the
new coming viral progeny at the Env incorporation process.

In conclusion, although the degree of ADCC antibody
responses to the gp120 protein varied from high to low,
there were certain potent consensus Env and Gag peptide
epitopes that could induce the ADCC antibody responses in
a majority of early infected individuals as shown in this study.
This information should be useful for further design of the
antibody epitope based vaccine. The pre-existing potent
antibody induced by the vaccine should be able to limit the
transmitted/founder viruses, delay acquisition, control viral
replication and prevent the establishment of infection. Since
cell-to-cell transmission appears to be more efficient than
that of free virion for HIV-1 infection,*' the ADCC responses
would be a very important mechanism to eliminate the small
number of virus-infected cells from an infected partner before
the establishment of infection. Although, Nt antibodies have

APJAI

 

no effect on cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1,® their responses
would be very crucial for eliminating free virions that may
enter simultaneously with the viral infected cells during viral
transmission. This warrants further study whether these ADCC
epitopes also act as Nt antibody epitopes. Our studies are limited by the use of peptide/protein pulsed target cells instead of
HIV-1 infected cells. The 3-dimentional structure of Env or Gag
on the target cell surface may be not the same as those on the
infected cells.

Abstract

Background: Intravenous drug users (IVDUs) are among the high-risk groups who are most vulnerable to HIV infection.
Several illicit drugs alter host immune function with increased incidence of infections including that of HIV. Many studies
of the immune response of NK cells in HIV-1 seronegative 1VDUs and HIV-1 seropositive IVDUs have been published
from the Western countries and yet no data is available from Thailand.

Objective: To determine natural killer cell cytotoxicity and lymphocyte subsets in Thai HIV-1 infected intravenous drug
users.

Methods: The NK cell cytotoxic function was determined using our well-established EGFP-K562 flow cytometric assay
in 30 IVDUs with HIV-1 infection (IVH) comparing with those from the same number of non-infected [VDUs (IVX),
HIV-1 seropositive individuals (HIV-1+ve) and healthy controls. The percentage and the absolute number of NK cells,
helper CD4* T cells and cytotoxic CD8* T cells were also investigated.

Results: Among the study groups, IVH showed not only the lowest percentage of lytic activity by NK cells, but also a
decline in the percentage and absolute count of NK cells. A decline in helper CD4* T cells and an increase of cytotoxic

CD8* T cells of [VH group when compared to those of other 3 groups were also demonstrated.

Conclusions: The failure of innate immune NK cell function and their number in IVH may support the involvement of
additional components of the immune system in the control of HIV-1 disease.

Key words: NK cells; NK cell cytotoxicity; CD4* T cells; CD8* T cells; HIV-1; intravenous drug users

Introduction

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS is still a
major global health problem with an estimated 35.3 million
people are living with HIV.! In Thailand, more than 1 million
of HIV-1 infected people were reported in 2015.’ Of the
estimated 440,000 people living with HIV, the relatively high
levels of prevalence were in men who have sex with men,
transgender people, male/female sex workers and their partners, migrant workers and intravenous drug users (IVDUs).

Interestingly, the HIV-1 prevalence among the Thai IVDUs
has the highest HIV-1 prevalence (about 30-50%) comparing
to other risk groups of HIV-1 infection’ with predominantly
a CRFO1_AE subtype.** It has been known that illicit drugs
alter immune unction and decrease host resistance to microbes
with increased incidence of infections or immune disorders in
humans, including infection with HIV and disease progression
to AIDS.”*

Human natural killer (NK) cells are large granular lymphocytes of the innate immune system.’ NK cells are recognized
as a subset of cytotoxic innate lymphoid cells which play a role
in the killing of tumor and virus-infected cells and participate
in shaping the adaptive immunity by secretion of cytokines."
NK cells are cytotoxic with small granules in their cytoplasm
contain proteins such as perforin and proteases known as
granzymes, these proteins are released when they encounter
with an infected cell by inducing either apoptosis or osmotic
cell lysis." NK cells can also recognize and lyse target cells
by antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).
The increased risk for the disease progression in HIV-infected
individuals are associated not only with the low number of the
NK cells but also with the defect in their cytotoxic activity" and
also with decline of helper CD4* T cells and the accumulation of
cytotoxic CD8* T cells."5!*

Although there are many studies of the innate immune
response of NK cells in HIV-1 seronegative [VDUs and HIV-1
seropositive [VDUs,'*'* the study of NK cells due to the HIV-1
infection and/or intravenous drug abuse in Thais has not
been conducted. In this study, we used our well-established
enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-K562 flow cytometric method” for measuring the NK cell function in IVDUs
with HIV-1 infection (IVH). Results were also compared with
those from HIV-1 infected individuals (HIV-1+ve) and non
-infected IVDUs (IVX) as well as healthy individuals.

Methods
Study population and blood samples

Thirty HIV-1 uninfected IVDUs, 22 males and 8 females,
and 30 HIV-1 infected IVDUs, 24 males and 6 females, at
Public Health Center 3 (Bang Sue), Health Department,
Bangkok Metropolitan Administration were enrolled in this
study with written informed consents. All volunteers were
documented to have treatment for drug addiction. All 30
HIV-1 infected IVDUs had previously tested once for HIV-1
antigen in saliva at this center. Fresh venipuncture Acid citrate
dextrose solution B (ACD, Becton Dickinson Biosciences
{BDB}, CA, USA) blood samples and Tripotassiumethylenediamine tetra-acetate (K,EDTA, BDB) blood samples from each
subject were collected. Complete blood counts (CBC) of each
blood sample was performed at the laboratory of Department
of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital
by using automate hematological analyzer Sysmex XE-5000
(Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan).

Leuko-pak and K,EDTA blood from 30 asymptomatic
HIV-1 infected blood donors, 22 males and 8 females, were
kindly provided by the Department of Transfusion Medicine,
Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital and Thai Red Cross.
Thirty healthy HIV-1 seronegative blood subjects, 23 males
and 7 females were also recruited from the blood bank donors.
All samples obtained had no donor identifiers. There were no
differences in the base line characteristics of all 4 study groups,
ie., age, sex ratio.

This study was approved by Ethics Committee of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration for IVDUs subjects (No.
147-2009) and Institutional Review Board, Faculty of Medicine
Siriraj Hospital (COA: Si031/2007) for all samples.

Immunophenotyping staining of peripheral blood samples

Percentages and absolute cell numbers of NK cells (CD3”
CD16'CD56"), helper CD4'T cells (CD3*CD4") and cytotoxic
CD8°'T cells (CD3*CD8") were determined by standard TriTESTmethod”™! using BD Tritest™ monoclonal antibody (mAb)
reagents. Briefly, ten pl of TriTEST 3-color mAb reagents were
mixed with 50 ul of EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood and
incubated for 20 min at room temperature in the dark before
adding 450 ul of FACS Lysing Solution (BDB). After an
incubation time of 15 min, the cells were washed at 1,400
rpm for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 300 ul of
1% paraformaldehyde and kept at 2-8°C until analysis by
FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BDB). Percentages of NK cells,
helper CD4* T cells and cytotoxic CD8* T cells were obtained
by using CellQuest™ Analysis software (BDB). The absolute
cell numbers of these lymphocyte subsets were determined by
multiplying the percentage of each subset with the absolute
lymphocyte counts from the CBC.

Preparation of effector cells

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from each
ACD blood sample were separated by standard ficoll-hypaque
density gradient centrifugation, washed three times with 0.2 M
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in freezing
medium containing 60% RPMI 1640 (Gibco Laboratories,
Grand Island, NY, USA), 30% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco
Laboratories) and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich
Corp, MO, USA). Aliquots of PBMCs at a density of 5x10°
cells/ml were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen until use. One
day prior to the experiment, PBMCs were thawed and added
to 100 mm polystyrene tissue culture plates (Griener Bio-One
GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) and incubated overnight
at 37°C with 5% CO, to deplete adherent monocytes. The non
-adherent lymphocytes were collected and resuspended at a
density of 1x10° for use as effector cells in the NK cell cytotoxicity assay.

Preparation of target cells

The EGFP-K562 cell line was prepared as previously described’® and used as targets for measuring NK cell cytotoxicity
by flow cytometry. This cell line was cultured in growth
medium containing RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mM
L-glutamine (Gibco Laboratories), 100 ug/ml streptomycin
(Gibco Laboratories), 100 IU/ml penicillin (Gibco Laboratories), and 10% heat inactivated FBS (Gibco Laboratories) and
400 ug/ml of neomycin analogue G-418 (Roche Diagnostics,
IN, USA). Prior to the experiment, the target cells were
resuspended in growth medium at a density of 1 x 10° cells/ml.

NK cytotoxicity flow cytometry assay

The EGFP-K562 flow cytometric assay for measuring NK
cytotoxicity was based on a method previously described.”
Briefly, four hundred microliters of PBMCs as effector cells at
a density of 1 x 10° cells/ml were added into individual round
bottom 12 x 75 mm polystyrene (Falcon) tubes (BDB) with
2-fold serial diluted in 10% RPMI 1640 growth medium. Fifty
microliters of EGFP-K562 target cells as a density of 1 x 10°
cells/ml were added into each tube to yield the effectors per

target cells (E/T) ratios of 80:1 and 40:1. All sample tubes
were mixed and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO, for 4 hours.
After incubation, propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma-Aldrich Corp)
solution at a concentration of 100 ug/ml was added into the
tubes to stain compromised or dead cells and then the tubes
were incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. The
cytotoxic activity of NK cells to lyse target cells was measured by
using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BDB). For measuring the
percent lysis of NK cytotoxicity, exactly 2 x 10‘ events per test
sample were examined and no gating was used for acquisition.
The threshold for side scatter (SSC) was set on the linear scale
to discriminate the debris and dead cells. Two parameters of
the forward and side scatter (FSC/SSC) dot plots signals were
analyzed by using CELLQuest™ software (BDB) (Figure 1A).
The EGFP versus PI data were obtained to evaluate live and
dead target cells using log scale of green fluorescent (FL1) or
EGFP in the X axis and the log scale of red fluorescent (FL2)
or PI in the Y axis (Figure 1B). The strong green fluorescent at
the lower right (LR) quadrant were identified as the live target
cells whereas the red and green fluorescent on the upper right
(UR) quadrant were identified as compromised or dead target
cells. The red fluorescence on the upper left (UL) quadrant
were defined as the autodamaged or potentially lysed effector
cells or target cells with decreased EGFP whereas the lower
left (LL) were considered to be the living effecter cells or living

target cells with weak green fluorescence. Effector cells alone
and target cells alone stained with PI were used as controls.
The percentage of target cell lysis was calculated by using the
following formula: % Lysis = (UR/UR + LR) x 100.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis in this study was conducted on SPSS
software version 11.5 (SPSS Inc., NY, USA). Statistical significance within group was analyzed by Shapiro-Wilk test and
statistical significance between groups was analyzed with one
-way ANOVA test. The significant level of each test between
groups was adjusted by multiple testing using Bonferroni
and Tamhane correction for homogeneity and heterogeneity
of variance, respectively. The significant threshold of four
comparisons of each test was set at p value < 0.05.

received tenofovir as antiretroviral drugs. All [VDUs subjects
had history for multiple intravenous and inhalation drug
behaviors. Their drugs used within the 3-month period prior
to blood collection were mainly heroin, methamphetamine,
domicum and cannabis for both IVX and IVH groups. Within
the IVX group, the percentage of participants that used
injecting drugs was 66% heroin, 52.4% methamphetamine
and 28.6% domicum, and inhalation drugs was 68.8%
methamphetamine and 56.3% cannabis (Table 1). For the [VH
group, the percentage was 37.5% heroin, 58.3% methamphetamine and 54.2% domicum, and inhalation drugs was 83.3%
methamphetamine and 61.1% cannabis (Table 1).

Percentages and absolute counts of NK cells, helper CD4* T
cells and cytotoxic CD8* T cells in the study populations
Mean percentages and absolute counts of each lymphocyte
subset among the study populations were compared and shown
in Table 2. The mean percentages of helper CD4" T cells of 'VH
group and HIV-1+ve group were significantly lower than those
of IVX group and healthy group. No statistically significant
difference among the two HIV-1 infected groups (IVH group
vs. HIV-1+ve group) and among the two HIV-1 seronegative
groups (IVX group vs. healthy group) were found. The mean
absolute counts of helper CD4* T cells from IVH group were
significant decreased (p < 0.001) when compared with those
from HIV-1+ve, IVX, and the healthy groups. Interestingly, the

absolute counts of helper CD4* T cells from IVX group were
significantly higher than those of healthy and HIV-1+ve groups
(p value < 0.05) while those of healthy and HIV-1+ve groups
were comparable.

For cytotoxic CD8" T cells, the mean percentages in HIV-1
+ve group and IVH group were significantly higher (p < 0.05)
than those of healthy group and IVX group. No statistically
significant differences among the HIV-1+ve and IVH groups
and among the IVX and healthy groups were seen (Table 2).
Comparison of the absolute counts of cytotoxic CD8* T cells
among the study groups showed that HIV-1+ve group had
a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the absolute counts when
compared with those of IVH, IVX and the healthy groups.
Moreover, no significant difference among the healthy, [VX and
IVH groups were observed.

Among the study groups, the mean percentage of NK cells
was significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in IVH group when
compared to those from healthy group but did not show any
significant difference to those of HIV-l+ve group and IVX
group. No significant differences in mean percentages of NK
cells were found among the HIV+ve, IVX and the healthy
groups (Table 2). For the absolute counts of NK cells, the IVH
group showed significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the absolute
counts when compared with those of HIV+ve, IVX and the
healthy groups. No significant differences among the healthy,
IVX and HIV-1+ve groups were found.

NK cell cytotoxicity in the study populations

Comparison of the mean percentages of EGFP-K562 target
cell lysis at the E:T ratios of 80:1 and 40:1 by NK cells from the
4 study groups showed that the IVH group showed significantly
decreased of NK cytotoxicity (p < 0.05) at the E:T ratio of
80:1 and 40:1 when compared to the other groups (Table 3).
nterestingly, the mean lysis percentages of NK cytotoxicity
in IVX group at both E/T ratios were significantly higher (p
< 0.05) than those in HIV-1+ve, IVH and the healthy groups,
particularly at E:T ratio of 80:1. Moreover, no difference of the
mean percentages lysis activity between the healthy and the
HIV-1+ve groups were shown.

Discussion

It is estimated that worldwide there are almost 13 million
people who are IVDUs. Out of these nearly 2 million, or
5%, are also living with HIV which is typically far greater
than it is among the rest of the adult population, with IVDUs
bearing a 28 times higher prevalence.” In Thailand, there were
an estimated 440,000 people living with HIV in Thailand in
2015 with an estimation of adult HIV prevalence of 1.1% out
of Thailand’s population of more than 60 million. Among 6,900
new HIV infections in 2015, unsafe injecting drug use is the
second biggest transmission route which account for 12%.*
During HIV-1 infection several immunological abnormalities
have been found in IVDUs.** It has been known that the
increased risk for the disease progression in HIV-infected
individuals is associated with the decline of helper CD4* T
cells and the accumulation of cytotoxic CD8* T cells with
a more rapid helper CD4* T cell decline among HIV-1
infected IVDUs.™ Biological factors such as effect of opioids,
co-infection with other diseases such as TB or hepatitis C, even a
difference in tropism with virulent strain of HIV transmitted
among the IVDUs are all responsible for the faster decline
in helper CD4* T cells.*’° A decline in both percentages and
absolute counts of helper CD4* T cells with marked increases
in percentages and absolute counts of cytotoxic CD8* T cells in
our IVH group support the above findings. Although there was
no history of how fast the decrease of helper CD4* T cells in
our IVH group as only one blood sample at one time point was
obtained, our IVH group showed more helper CD4* T cell
decline than those in HIV+ve group. This may indicate
the problems with an irregular adherence to antiretroviral
drugs, loss of follow-up or lower access to health services
in our IVH group. Unlike the decline helper T cells found in
IVH group, our HIV+ve group showed higher helper CD4*
T cell counts than the IVH group implying that there was a
good suppressing HIV replication in these asymptomatic
HIV-1 infected blood donors. Unfortunately, the history of

 

antiretroviral drug treatment was not available for this group.

NK cells have been described for the innate mechanism
as the first line defense against HIV-1 infection and may help
mediating adaptive immune responses.'”? It has been shown
that NK cell effect or function that mediated NK cell
cytotoxicity are impaired during the course of HIV-1 disease”
but enhanced during HIV-1 viremia.”” Previous studies on the
NK profiles from the cohort of HIV-1 exposed, uninfected
IVDUs demonstrated the enhancement of NK activity, high
NK activation as represented by CD38* cells, and the CD4
and CD8 cell-mediated resistance to HIV-1 infection.'*’*”?
However, there is limited information available regarding the
effect of HIV-1 infection on the NK profile in Thai IVDUs.
Our NK cytotoxicity study in IVDUs showed significantly
decreased of lysis activity in IVH group when compared to
those of healthy, HIV-1+ve and IVX groups. When defining
the percentage and absolute count of NK cells, our study
showed significant decrease of both the percentage and the
absolute count of NK cells in IVH group when compared
to those of healthy, HIV-1+ve and IVX groups. This data
suggested the inverse effect to the NK cell numbers due to
HIV-1 infection along with the use of injecting drugs. Our
findings also support that the drug abuse has immune-modulating effects which could alter the progression of HIV
infection.*!

Of interest is that the NK functional activity in our IVX
group was significantly increased when compared to the
other 3 groups. The increased NK cell lysis activity in the
IVX who are a high-risk group, could due to different
mechanisms related either to immune responses and/or to
genetic background contribute to the resistance to infection in
the highly exposed but uninfected (EU) IVDUs. Our results
support the contentions of enhanced innate immune cell
function in EU individuals especially when compare with
IVDUs who became HIV-1 infected.* There was no difference
of the mean percentages NK celllys is activity between the
healthy and the HIV-1+ve groups. This may be due to the
asymptomatic stage of our HIV+ve individuals whose NK
cell functions were still normal. When defining the percentage and absolute count of NK cells, our study demonstrated
that not only there was no significant difference of the mean
percentages of NK lysis activity among the HIV+ve, IVX
and the healthy groups, but also there was no difference in
percentages and the absolute counts of NK cells. Our findings
are in line with de Souza et al. who reported that NK cell
cytotoxicity and NK cell counts are not different between Thai
HIV-1 seronegative and Thai HIV-1 seropositive subjects.”

In conclusion, our study shows that IVHs have alterations
in the lymphocyte subsets evidenced by a decrease in helper

CD4* T cells and an increase in cytotoxic CD8* T cells along
with a lower number of NK cells and their impaired cytotoxic
function. The data suggest that the failure of innate immune
NK cell function and their number with possible link to
decrease in helper CD4* T cells and increase in cytotoxic CD8*
T cells, may contribute to the ineffective immune surveillance
and potentially predisposing them to progressive disease.

NEW author guidelines for APJAI
(effective as of February 1, 2017)

 

 

Please submit your manuscript via on-line submission
system at the following address: http://www.apjai-journal.org.

Mission Statement

The Asian Pacific Journal of Allergy and Immunology
(APJAI) publishes original research articles, clinical
observations, case reports and reviews on various aspects of
allergy and immunology provided that they have not been, and
will not be, published elsewhere in whole, or in part, without the
Editor’s permission. Papers accepted become the copyright of
the Journal. Authors are responsible for all statements in articles
submitted to the APJAI.

Journal Publication Policies and Procedures

The APJAI will consider for publication those papers
directly related to allergy and immunology and has agreed to
‘ollow the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted
to Biomedical Journals (the “Uniform Requirements”) of the
nternational Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE),
the full text of which is available at http://www.icmje.org.
The manuscript submission instructions for the APJAI
submission are consistent with the 2009 version of the Uniform
Requirements. The Editor assumes that upon submission of
a manuscript, all listed authors have agreed with the APJAI
policies. Manuscripts that do not meet these guidelines will
be returned to the submitting author for revision prior to any
further consideration for peer review.
Submissions will be considered for publication in APJAI
only if they are submitted solely to APJAI. It must not have been
previously published and must not be under consideration for
publication elsewhere. All published manuscripts become the
permanent property of the APJAI and may not be published
elsewhere without written permission.

 

Ethical Approval of Studies and Informed Consent

For all research studies involving human subjects or
research material derived from humans, a statement describing
approval by the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB)
is required in the Methods Section. Authors must declare how
and if the informed consents were obtained from the study
participants, if the study is conducted in humans, in the
Methods Section. Studies exempted from IRB approval by their
respective boards should be indicated in the Methods Section.
Institutional Review Board approval and informed consent
statements are not required for Case Reports. Studies involving
experimental animals must include a statement in the Methods
Section indicating that institutional or national guidelines
were followed for the care and use of the animals. Failure to
comply with this requirement will result in the manuscript
being returned without review.

Clinical Trial Registration

APJAI requires investigators to preregister their clinical
trials in a public trials registry approved by WHO (http://www.
who.int/ictrp/network/primary/en/).

APJAI has adopted the WHO's definition of a clinical trial:
“any research study that prospectively assigns human
participants or groups of humans to one or more health-related

interventions to evaluate the effects on health outcomes.” The
clinical trial registration number and name of the registry
should be clearly identified on the title page and in the Methods
Section.
