ABSTRACT

 

BACKGROUND

Many patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria (also called chronic spontaneous
urticaria) do not have a response to therapy with H,-antihistamines, even at high
doses. In phase 2 trials, omalizumab, an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody that targets
IgE and affects mast-cell and basophil function, has shown efficacy in such patients.

METHODS

In this phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic idiopathic urticaria who remained symptomatic despite H,-antihistamine therapy (licensed doses). We randomly assigned 323 patients to receive three subcutaneous
injections, spaced 4 weeks apart, of omalizumab at doses of 75 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg
or placebo, followed by a 16-week observation period. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline in a weekly itch-severity score (ranging from 0 to
21, with higher scores indicating more severe itching).

RESULTS

The baseline weekly itch-severity score was approximately 14 in all four study groups.
At week 12, the mean (+SD) change from baseline in the weekly itch-severity score
was —5.1£5.6 in the placebo group, —5.9+6.5 in the 75-mg group (P=0.46), —8.146.4
in the 150-mg group (P=0.001), and —9.8+6.0 in the 300-mg group (P<0.001). Most
prespecified secondary outcomes at week 12 showed similar dose-dependent ef
fects. The frequency of adverse events was similar across groups. The frequency of
serious adverse events was low, although the rate was higher in the 300-mg group
(6%) than in the placebo group (3%) or in either the 75-mg or 150-mg group (1%
for each).

CONCLUSIONS

Omalizumab diminished clinical symptoms and signs of chronic idiopathic urticaria
in patients who had remained symptomatic despite the use of approved doses of
H,-antihistamines. (Funded by Genentech and Novartis Pharma; ClinicalTrials.gov
number, NCT01292473.)

OMALIZUMAB FOR CHRONIC IDIOPATHIC URTICARIA

\) HRONIC IDIOPATHIC URTICARIA (ALSO
called chronic spontaneous urticaria) is
4 defined as itchy hives that last for at least
6 weeks, with or without angioedema, and that
have no apparent external trigger.t The condition
generally has a prolonged duration of 1 to 5 years
(persisting for >5 years in 11 to 14% of patients)
and has a detrimental effect on patients’ emotional and physical health-related quality of life.+5
The impairment accompanying this disorder has
been likened to that seen in patients with ischemic heart disease, with patients feeling a similar
lack of energy, social isolation, and emotional
upset as those with heart disease.° Nonsedating
H,-antihistamines are the current mainstay for
initial treatment and are the only agents licensed
for use in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria.*” However, a majority of patients do not
have a response to H,-antihistamines, even when
the drugs are administered at three to four times
their licensed dose.**1°

Treatment options for patients who do not
have a response to H,-antihistamines include the
use of H,-antihistamines, leukotriene-receptor antagonists, systemic glucocorticoids, cyclosporine,
hydroxychloroquine, dapsone, methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and intravenous immune globulin.
None of these agents have yet received regulatory approval for the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria. In addition, the data supporting
the use of these drugs are limited, and long-term
use of some of the agents can be associated with
substantial side effects.

Histamine release from cutaneous mast cells
has long been associated with the pathogenesis
of urticaria, whereas in patients with chronic
idiopathic urticaria, basophils and IgE may also
play an important role.1? Omalizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody approved
as add-on therapy for moderate-to-severe persistent allergic asthma,!3"* reduces the levels of
free IgE and the high-affinity receptor for the Fc
region of IgE (FceRI), both of which are essential in mast-cell and basophil activation.1>*¢ Studies have shown that omalizumab may suppress
allergen-mediated skin reactions through its reduction of FceRI function in basophils and mast
cells.1517 Initial evidence from two proof-ofconcept studies showed that omalizumab may

be effective in patients with chronic idiopathic
urticaria who remained symptomatic despite antihistamine treatment.**? Subsequent data from
two phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled
multicenter studies involving a total of 139 patients corroborated these early findings, demonstrating that omalizumab, which has a known
safety profile, has beneficial effects on symptoms
in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria who
remain symptomatic despite the use of approved
doses of H,-antihistamines.?°?7

Here we report the results of the first of three
phase 3 clinical trials in patients with chronic
idiopathic urticaria in which we evaluated the
effects of three doses of omalizumab as compared with placebo.

 

METHODS

 

STUDY DESIGN

In this international, multicenter, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of omalizumab
over 28 weeks in adult and adolescent (212 years)
patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria who had
remained symptomatic despite the use of approved
doses of H,-antihistamines. After a 2-week screening period, patients were randomly assigned to
four groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive three subcutaneous injections of omalizumab (at doses of
75 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg) or placebo.

We selected the doses for this study on the
basis of the results of a previous phase 2 doseranging study.2° Doses were administered at
4-week intervals, and to ensure that the blinding
was maintained, each dose was administered by
a qualified designated clinician who was not involved in the evaluation of the patient’s symptoms. This 12-week treatment period was followed by a 16-week follow-up period (for further
details, see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM
.org). Patients used an electronic handheld device to self-record data with a validated Urticaria
Patient Daily Diary (UPDD)???3 (see the Supplementary Appendix). This electronic diary was
stamped with the time and date to ensure that
data were not included outside of each assessment period.

The NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL of MEDICINE

Patients continued to receive stable doses of
their prerandomization H,-antihistamine throughout the treatment period. During the follow-up
period, patients were permitted to use a licensed
dose of one additional H,-antihistamine. For the
duration of the study, all patients were provided
with diphenhydramine (25 mg) as rescue medication for itch relief (up to a maximum of three
doses in 24 hours on the basis of local regulations).

The study protocol, which is available at
NEJM.org, was approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee at each study
center or by a central institutional review board.
The study was conducted in accordance with
Food and Drug Administration regulations, Good
Clinical Practice guidelines, and any other applicable laws of other countries. An independent
data and safety monitoring committee oversaw
the study conduct and reviewed blinded and
unblinded safety data every 6 months (see the
Supplementary Appendix).

STUDY OVERSIGHT

The study was sponsored by Genentech and Novartis Pharma, whose representatives were involved in data collection (along with the investigators) and in the interpretation and analysis of
the data and who vouch for the accuracy and
completeness of the data presented and for the
fidelity of this report to the study protocol. Representatives of both companies were involved in
the design of the study, with scientific advice obtained from external experts on chronic idiopathic urticaria. The authors wrote all drafts of
the manuscript and made the decision to submit
the manuscript for publication. Editorial support
and assistance with incorporation of revisions was
provided by a medical writer who was employed by
Genentech. All authors and contributors were under nondisclosure agreements with Genentech.

PATIENTS

Patients were included in the study if they were
between the ages of 12 and 75 years (between
18 and 75 years in Germany) and met all the following criteria: a history of at least 6 months of
chronic idiopathic urticaria, the presence of hives
associated with itching for at least 8 consecutive
weeks at any time before enrollment despite current use of H,-antihistamines, an urticaria activity score (UAS) during a 7-day period (UAS7) of

16 or more (on a scale ranging from 0 to 42, with
higher scores indicating greater activity and a minimally important difference [MID] of 9.5 to 10.5),?4
a weekly itch-severity score of 8 or more (on a
scale ranging from 0 to 21, with higher scores
indicating more severe itching and an MID of >5)
during the 7 days before randomization (week 0),
a score of 4 or more on the UAS (ranging from 0
to 6, with higher scores indicating greater activity) as assessed by a clinician on at least one of
the screening-visit days, and receipt of a licensed
dose of a second-generation H,-antihistamine
(see the Supplementary Appendix) for chronic
idiopathic urticaria for at least 3 consecutive
days immediately preceding the screening visit
14 days before randomization, and no missing
electronic-diary entries for the 7 days before randomization.

Exclusion criteria included a clearly defined
underlying cause for chronic urticaria (e.g.,
physical urticaria), routine administration (i.e.,
daily or every other day for >5 consecutive days)
of systemic glucocorticoids, hydroxychloroquine,
methotrexate, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide,
or intravenous immune globulin within the previous 30 days for any indication, the use of any
H,-antihistamine or leukotriene-receptor antagonist within 7 days preceding the screening visit
14 days before randomization, the use of H,antihistamines at greater-than-licensed doses
within 3 days preceding the screening visit
14 days before randomization, a history of cancer, a weight of less than 20 kg, a known hypersensitivity to omalizumab, treatment with omalizumab within the previous year, or pregnancy.

Before inclusion in the study, all patients or a
parent or legal guardian (for those under the age
of 18 years) provided written informed consent.

ASSESSMENTS

Patients recorded their outcomes in the electronic
diary,?:?3 reporting every morning and evening
the itch-severity score (with 0 indicating none, 1
indicating mild, 2 indicating moderate, and 3 indicating severe), the number of hives (with 0 indicating none, 1 indicating 1 to 6, 2 indicating 7 to
12, and 3 indicating >12, with an MID of 5.0 to
5.5 for the weekly average), and scores for the
size of the largest hive (with 0 indicating none, 1
indicating <1.25 cm, 2 indicating 1.25 to 2.5 cm,
and 3 indicating >2.5 cm, with an MID of 4.5 to
5 for the weekly average). The patients reported

once daily on interference with sleep and daily
activities (on a scale of 0 to 3, with higher scores
indicating more interference on each measure),
use of rescue medication as provided in 25-mg
diphenhydramine tablets (0 to 9 tablets), the presence of angioedema (yes or no), angioedema management, and any contact with a health care provider (see the Supplementary Appendix for further
details). Compliance with reporting in the electronic diary was evaluated throughout the study.

Average daily scores (morning and evening assessments) for itch severity and the number of
hives were totaled each week to derive the UAS7.7+
Patients completed the Dermatology Life Quality
Index (ranging from 0 to 30, with higher scores
indicating a worse quality of life and an MID of
2.24 to 3.10)?5¢ at baseline and at weeks 4, 12, and
28, and the Chronic Urticaria Quality-of Life Questionnaire (ranging from 0 to 100, with higher
scores indicating a worse quality of life) at baseline and at weeks 12 and 28.

STUDY END POINTS

The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 12 in the weekly itch-severity scores.
The 12-week score was calculated as the sum of
the averaged daily itch-severity score for the previous 7 days, and the baseline score was the sum
of the daily itch-severity scores during the 7 days
before randomization.

Secondary end points, which were all evaluated at week 12, were changes from baseline in the
UAS7 and in the score for the weekly number of
hives,?* the time until a reduction from baseline
of at least 5 points?3 in the weekly itch-severity
score (the MID), the proportions of patients with
a UAS7 of 6 or less (considered to represent improvement in disease), the number of patients
with a weekly MID response in the itch-severity
score, the change from baseline in the score for
the size of the largest hive,?* the change from
baseline in the overall score on the Dermatology
Life Quality Index, and the proportion of angioedema-free days from week 4 to week 12 (see the
Supplementary Appendix for further details).

We conducted post hoc analyses of the proportion of patients who were free of hives or free
of both hives and itching at week 12 (with the
latter indicated by a UAS7 of 0) and 13 additional
prespecified subgroup analyses for the primary
end point. We assessed as exploratory end points
changes from baseline in the use of rescue medi
cation (diphenhydramine) and in the score on the
Chronic Urticaria Quality-ofLife Questionnaire.
Safety was evaluated by recording and monitoring the frequency and severity of treatmentemergent adverse events and serious adverse
events. Verbatim descriptions of adverse events
were coded with the use of the Medical Dictionary
for Regulatory Activities (version 15.0) and analyzed
with the use of appropriate thesaurus terms.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

In estimating the power for determining efficacy,
we assumed a mean change from baseline to
week 12 in the weekly itch-severity score of 9 points
in the omalizumab group and a mean change of
3.5 points in the placebo group, with a common
standard deviation of 6 points. Assuming an early discontinuation rate of 15% by week 12, we
determined that the enrollment of 300 patients
(75 patients in each treatment group) would yield
a power of approximately 98% to detect a difference in treatment effect in the primary end point
at the 0.05 level for any omalizumab group.

The efficacy analyses were conducted on the
basis of data from the modified intention-to-treat
population, which included all patients who had
undergone randomization and who had received
at least one dose of a study drug. The treatment
group was defined according to the treatment the
patient was assigned to receive, whereas the safety
population was defined according to treatment
actually received.

For the primary end point, we analyzed differences between each of the omalizumab treatment groups and the placebo group using an
analysis-of-covariance model stratified according
to the estimated baseline weekly itch-severity
score (<13 vs. >13) and baseline weight (<80 kg vs.
280 kg). The strata were predefined on the basis
of the medians reported in a phase 2 clinical
study.?° Missing data at week 12 were imputed
with the baseline score (baseline observation carried forward). (Additional details on the statistical
methods, including analyses of the secondary end
points, are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.)

Figure 1. Enrollment and Outcomes.

Among the 83 patients who were assigned to receive 150 mg of omalizumab, 1 patient decided not to receive the study medication and
was therefore not included in the modified intention-to-treat population. Six patients who were assigned to receive 75 mg of omalizumab

received at least 1 dose of 150 mg of omalizumab during the treatment period and were included in the group receiving 150 mg of omalizumab for the safety analysis.

frequent reasons for exclusion were evidence of
current drug or alcohol abuse (14%), contraindications to the use of diphenhydramine (12%),
and other reasons that were not specified (33%).
Thus, 323 patients underwent randomization
and received at least one dose of a study drug in
addition to stable doses of their prerandomization H,-antihistamine (Fig. 1). The overall treatment discontinuation rate was 6%, and the overall study discontinuation rate was 10%, with no
major differences in these measures among the

study groups (see the Supplementary Appendix
for further details).

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were similar across the study groups (Table
1). For the overall population, the mean (+SD) age
was 42.5+13.7, women comprised 76% of patients, 85% were white, the mean body weight
was 82.4+21.9 kg, and the mean body-mass index
(the weight in kilograms divided by the square
of the height in meters) was 29.8+7.3. The mean
IgE level for patients at baseline was elevated:

168.2+231.9 IU per milliliter (aormal range, 13 to
127), with a median of 78 IU per milliliter. The
mean time since the diagnosis of chronic idiopathic urticaria was 6.5+8.6 years, the mean
number of previous medications for chronic idiopathic urticaria was 4.3+2.7 (Table S1 in the
Supplementary Appendix), the mean in-clinic
UAS was 5.3+£0.7, the mean UAS7 was 30.7+6.8,
the weekly itch-severity score was 14.0+3.7, the
weekly score for the number of hives was
16.7+4.3, and the use of rescue medication was
7.3£7.8 tablets per week. Angioedema was present during the week before randomization in 41%
of patients.

The mean rates of diary compliance were high
(>97%) and did not differ significantly across all
study groups during the treatment period (Table
$2 in the Supplementary Appendix).

EFFICACY

Baseline weekly itch-severity scores were approximately 14 in all treatment groups (Table 1). The
mean changes from baseline in weekly itch-severity scores at week 12 (primary end point) were significantly improved in the group receiving 150 mg
of omalizumab (-8.1+6.4, P=0.001) and 300 mg
of omalizumab (—9.8+6.0, P<0.001) but not in the
group receiving 75 mg of omalizumab (-5.9+6.5,
P=0.46), as compared with placebo (-5.1+5.6)
(Table 2). The reductions from baseline in mean
weekly itch-severity scores were dose-responsive
with all three omalizumab doses and were better
than the placebo responses at the time points
before week 12 (Fig. 2A). After week 12 (followup period), the mean weekly itch-severity scores
for all omalizumab groups increased to reach
values similar to those in the placebo group and
did not return to baseline values for the duration
of follow-up. Sensitivity analyses for the primary
end point that used different methods for handling missing data showed similar results to those
of the primary analysis (Tables $3, S4, and S5 in
the Supplementary Appendix).

There was a significant difference between the
group receiving either 150 mg or 300 mg of
omalizumab and the placebo group with respect
to all prespecified secondary end points (changes
from baseline in UAS7 and the weekly score for
the number of hives, the time to the MID in weekly itch-severity scores, the proportion of patients
with a UAS7 of <6, the proportion of patients

with the MID response in weekly itch-severity
scores, the change from baseline in the score for
the size of the largest hive, the change from
baseline in the overall Dermatology Life Quality
Index, and the proportion of angioedema-free
days from weeks 4 to 12) (Table 2, and Table S6
and Fig. $1 through S6 in the Supplementary
Appendix), except for the difference in the number of angioedema-free days from week 4 to
week 12, which reached significance only in the
300-mg group. Similar to weekly itch-severity
scores, the weekly score for the number of hives
decreased with all three doses of omalizumab to
a greater extent than with placebo throughout
the 12-week treatment period, with the largest
difference observed in the 300-mg group (Fig.
2B). After week 12 (i.e., during the follow-up
period), the mean weekly score for the number
of hives for all omalizumab groups increased to
reach values similar to those in the placebo
group and did not return to baseline values for
the duration of follow-up.

The exploratory analysis of scores on the
Chronic Urticaria Quality-of-Life Questionnaire
showed similar results to those from the other
end points that were assessed in this study (Fig.
S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).

In the post hoc analyses at week 12, the proportions of patients who were completely free of
hives were 10% in the placebo group, 18% in the
group receiving 75 mg of omalizumab, 23% in the
group receiving 150 mg of omalizumab, and 53%
in the group receiving 300 mg of omalizumab;
among patients who were free of both hives and
itching (i.e., a UAS7 score of 0), the proportions
were 5%, 16%, 22%, and 44%, respectively (Fig. S8
and S9 in the Supplementary Appendix).

At baseline, the mean number of diphenhydramine tablets (25 mg) that patients were taking as
rescue medication was 7.3+7.8. The mean changes from baseline in the weekly number of tablets
were —2.346.1 in the group receiving 75 mg of
omalizumab (P=0.91), -3.7£6.0 in the group
receiving 150 mg of omalizumab (P=0.07), and
—4.1+5.4 in the group receiving 300 mg of omalizumab (P=0.0D), as compared with -2.2+5.0 in
the placebo group (Fig. S10 in the Supplementary Appendix).

In prespecified subgroup analyses for the primary end point, no meaningful interpretation of
results or definitive conclusions could be made

because of the reduced sample sizes for these
analyses (data not shown).

SAFETY

The percentages of patients with at least one adverse event were similar across the treatment
groups: 61% in the placebo group, 59% in those
receiving 75 mg of omalizumab, 67% in those
receiving 150 mg of omalizumab, and 65% in
those receiving 300 mg of omalizumab (Table 3,
and Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).
During the 28-week study period, there were reports of nine serious adverse events, with five
reported in the group receiving 300 mg of omalizumab (6%), two in the placebo group (3%),
and one each in the groups receiving 75 mg and
150 mg of omalizumab (1% for each). Most of the
adverse events were reported in the 150-mg and
300-mg groups during the follow-up period, when
no drug was being administered (Table 3, and Table
S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). No deaths or
episodes of anaphylactic shock were reported dur
ing the study. There were no major imbalances in
any of the system organ classes affected by adverse events, with the exception of headache, with
more cases being reported in the group receiving
150 mg of omalizumab than in the placebo group.
(Additional details on safety information are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.)

 

DISCUSSION

 

In this study, we found that omalizumab administered as three doses of 150 mg or 300 mg at
4-week intervals significantly reduced symptoms,
as compared with placebo, in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria who remained symptomatic
despite the use of approved doses of H,-antihistamines. Significant and clinically meaningful effects were seen for patients receiving either 150 mg
or 300 mg of omalizumab in the change from baseline in the weekly itch-severity score (primary end
point) and all secondary end points at week 12,
with the exception of the proportion of angioede

* Plus-minus values are means +SD. The modified intention-to-treat population included all patients who had undergone randomization and received at least one dose of a study drug. There were no significant differences among the
groups at baseline. Percentages may not total 100 because of rounding.

Race was self-reported.

The body-mass index is the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters.

Data are for 77 patients in the placebo group, 80 in the group assigned to receive 75 mg of omalizumab, 81 in the
group assigned to receive 150 mg of omalizumab, and 76 in the group assigned to receive 300 mg of omalizumab.
The urticaria activity score (UAS) ranges from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater activity. This value was defined as the largest value among those obtained on screening visits on days 14 and 7 before randomization and on
the day 1 visit.

|| The UAS during a 7-day period (UAS7) ranges from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating greater activity and a mini

ma-free days during week 4 through week 12 in
the group receiving 150 mg of the drug. Furthermore, the safety profile for omalizumab was
similar to that previously reported in omalizumabtreated patients with allergic asthma.131+7778
However, the majority of serious adverse events
occurred in the group receiving the highest dose
(300 mg) of omalizumab.

Omalizumab had an onset of effect within a
week after initiation in this patient population
(Fig. 2, and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The median time to MID response in the
weekly itch-severity score was significantly shorter in the group receiving 300 mg of omalizumab
(1 week) and in the group receiving 150 mg
(2 weeks) than in the placebo group (4 weeks)
(Table 2). The phase 2 studies also showed reductions in the UAS and UAS7 during the first
week of omalizumab treatment.?°?+

The duration of suppression in the weekly itchseverity score after week 12 was greater in patients
receiving the higher doses (150 mg and 300 mg)
of omalizumab. There did not appear to be a rebound increase in symptoms back to baseline
during the course of the study once omalizumab
had been discontinued. However, it is possible
that some patients’ symptoms during follow-up
may have remained under better control because
they were allowed to take an additional H,-antihistamine during this period. In the placebo
group, after an initial small reduction in the
mean weekly itch-severity score during the first
couple of weeks, scores remained unchanged for
the remainder of the study period. The observation that symptoms gradually recur after discontinuation (as shown by the increase in mean
itch-severity scores and scores for the number of
hives after week 12) suggests that omalizumab

* The safety population was defined according to the treatment actually received. A complete list of adverse events is

provided in Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix.

{The nine reported serious adverse events were pneumonia and hemorrhoids in one patient each in the placebo group;
angioedema in one patient in the 75-mg group; angioedema and idiopathic urticaria in one patient in the 150-mg
group; and melanoma in situ, nephrolithiasis, idiopathic urticaria, tonsillectomy, and melena in one patient each in the
300-mg group. After a review of the hospital discharge summary after the database lock, it was determined that the patient with melena had no anemia; the cause of hospital admission was elective endoscopy for nonanemic melena. The
patient underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy, which revealed only diverticulosis with no other
potential source of bleeding. Thus, it was determined that this patient had a nonserious event of nonanemic melena
rather than a serious adverse event, as initially reported. Additional details about the serious adverse events are provid
ed in Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix.

severe adverse event was defined as the occurrence of symptoms causing an inability to perform usual social and

functional activities. A complete description of the severe adverse events is provided in the Safety section in the

Supplementary Appendix.

 

administered as three doses at 4-week intervals
did not substantially modify the basic underlying
disease process in this population during this time
period (Fig. 2).

The mechanism by which omalizumab works
to improve urticaria has not been fully elucidated. It has been reported that patients with active
chronic idiopathic urticaria have abnormal basophil function, including suppression of the highaffinity IgE receptor (FceRI) pathway (related to
altered expression of Src homology 2-containing
inositol phosphatase), blood basopenia, and recruitment of basophils to skin-lesion sites.1? In
patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria in remission, blood basopenia and suppressed FceRI
function revert toward normal.!? In previous
studies, the binding of circulating IgE by omalizumab has been shown to lead to a reduction in
free IgE within hours after administration and
down-regulation of FceRI on blood basophils
within 2 weeks; in mast cells, reduction in FceRI
expression and degranulation typically occurs

after 8 weeks.1529.3° This study was not designed
to further elucidate the mechanism of action of
omalizumab in patients with chronic idiopathic
urticaria.

In conclusion, during the initial 12 weeks of
our study, omalizumab at doses of 150 mg and
300 mg significantly improved outcomes as reported by patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria who remained symptomatic despite the use
of approved doses of H,-antihistamines. The number of patients who were treated was too small
to draw any definitive safety conclusions, but
serious adverse events were more common in the
group treated with the highest dose of omalizumab. Further work is needed before the exact role
of omalizumab in the treatment of chronic idiopathic or spontaneous urticaria can be defined.
