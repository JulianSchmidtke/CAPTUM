tests and were significantly more atopic (92.9% and 28.8%; p<0.001). Moderate-to-severe
asthma significantly correlated with older age at the time of diagnosis, older age of asthma
onset, higher body mass index, less atopy and fewer pollen sensitivity. Asthma
severity of patients with SR was significantly milder than the reference group (OR: 0.6,
95% Cl 0.5-0.8). Asthma with Al tended to be more severe although the relation was
insignificant (OR:1.6 95% Cl:0.8-3.5).

Conclusions: Asthma patients with SR have significantly milder and earlier onset of
asthma, better pulmonary function tests and are significantly more atopic while asthma
with Al tends to be more severe. Asthma with CU does not show a specific phenotypic

Introduction

Asthma is the most frequently seen pulmonary disease which
affects nearly 300 million individuals worldwide.' Although
various treatment guidelines have provided consensus
definitions of asthma, these definitions could not possibly
reflect the differences in clinical manifestations of the
disease.'? It seems to be a heterogeneous disease which
presents with different clinical phenotypes.

Phenotype is described as “‘all the observable characteristics of an organism that result from the interaction of its
genotype and the environment”’.* Although different phenotypes of asthma have drawn the attention of clinicians for
many years, most of them have been gathered under the
classical term “asthma” since biomarkers, genetic or
physiopathological characteristics of these phenotypes have
not been adequately and effectively defined. However, in
recent years, the idea of phenotype specific treatment has
led to more detailed phenotyping attempts.*

The association of persistent rhinitis and asthma is a
well-defined clinical entity within the “one airway, one
disease” concept. However, accompaniment of analgesic
intolerance (Al), seasonal rhinitis (SR) or chronic urticaria
(CU) to asthma are encountered at a relatively lower
frequency. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to compare
the patients with asthma diagnosis alone with the patients,
who, in addition to their asthma, had accompanying Al, CU
or SR and to evaluate if there are any clinical or
demographical distinctions and specific characteristics of
these defined groups.

Patients and methods

In our study, the patient group with asthma diagnosis alone
was taken as reference group and comparison of the
asthmatic patients with associated Al, CU, or SR was
planned. Archieves of the Adult Allergy Unit of Chest
Diseases Department were consulted for the selection of
the patients from the defined patient groups.

From the archive encompassing the period between 1991
and 2007, primarily asthmatic patients with SR and CU who
were thought to be fewer, were investigated. Records of 84
and 46 patients respectively were determined and included
in the study. Subsequently, the archive was screened from
2007 backwards, and the files of 84 asthma patients with Al
and 84 patients with asthma diagnosis alone were determined in accordance with the number of asthma patients
with SR. From these files, 75 asthma patients with Al and as
a control group 71 patients with asthma diagnosis alone,
who had complete data, were enrolled in the study.

The diagnosis of asthma was in accordance with Global
Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines. Patients describing
nasal symptoms such as sneezing, rhinorea, nasal itching and
congestion seasonally, were considered as SR patients.
Patients with recurrent, self-limiting, itchy plaques or
angio-oedema persisting for more than six weeks were
defined as CU. Diagnosis of Al was made based on placebo
controlled oral provocation tests or at least two reliable
histories of analgesic intolerance.

From the files demographic data, age at onset for
asthma and additional diseases was determined. Moreover,

information about familial atopy, keeping pets, and Ear Nose
Throat (ENT) surgery was compiled. Pulmonary function
tests (PFT) at the time of diagnosis were compiled and body
mass indexes (BMI) were calculated based on parameters of
heights and body weights derived from these measurements.

Skin prick tests (SPTs) were collected under four main
categories: house dust mites, pollens, fungi and animal
epithels. Wheals with a mean diameter at least 3 mm more
than that of the control are considered as positive cases.
Since different proportions of patients without SPTs were
encountered among defined patient groups, prick test
results were given both including and excluding patients
without prick tests. Patients who had any positive prick test
were accepted as atopic asthma patient.

Severity of asthma was divided into three categories in
accordance with GINA classification as mild, moderate, and
severe in consideration of pulmonary function tests and
clinical features. Since patients in the severe category were
scarce in number, cases in the severe and moderate
categories were combined and analysed.

Statistical Analyses: Data of the patient groups included
in the study were expressed as mean+SD for continuous,
and as the number of cases and percentages for categorical
variables. For comparisons between patient groups, oneway ANOVA test for continuous, and Chi-square test for
categoric variables were used. Fisher’s exact test was used
when 25% of or more of the expected cell count was less
than 5. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple
comparisons. In pairwise comparisons, the group of patients
with asthma diagnosis alone was used as control group. In
comparisons for the severity of asthma, moderate and
severe categories were combined due to scarcity of severe
asthma patients. Multiple logistic regression models were
established to investigate the independent association
between asthma phenotypes and the severity of asthma.
In these models, combination of moderate and severe
asthma was taken as dependent variable, and independent
association between asthma phenotypes and the severity of
asthma was presented as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence
interval (Cl) calculated using Wald method. Confounding
factors included in the models were: age, gender, and
factors associated with the severity of asthma in the
univariate analysis. Statistical significance was defined for
p values less than 0.05. Statistical Package for Social
Sciences (SPSS) 10.0 for Windows was used in the statistical
analysis.

Results

Eighty-four asthma patients diagnosed with asthma and SR,
46 with asthma and CU, 75 with asthma and Al, and 71
patients with asthma alone were enrolled to the study. The
patient characteristics according to disease groups are
shown in Table 1. The mean age of all patients was
37.2+13 (15-80) years and 195 (70.7%) were females. The
mean age of asthmatic patients with SR at the time of
diagnosis was significantly lower than that of the control
group (31.9+10.4 and 40.9+14.9 years, respectively;
p<0.001). A total of 79 patients (28.6%) were current
smokers. Distribution of genders and smoking status did not
differ among patient groups. Compared to the reference

group, asthma patients with SR had a significantly earlier
onset of asthma (age: 34.5+15.9, and 27.4+10.8;
respectively, p<0.01). Prevalence of any familial atopic
disease, and keeping a pet at home were found as 62.5
and 11.2%, respectively, without a significant difference
between groups. Asthma patients with analgesic intolerance
had a significantly higher rate of nasal operations (29.3% and
11.3%; respectively, p<0.05).

The distribution of SPT results according to patient groups
is shown in Table 2. In analysis performed after excluding
the patients for whom prick test had not been performed, in
the group of asthma patients with SR, significantly higher
rates of atopy were detected compared to the reference
group (92.9% and 28.8%, respectively; p<0.001). When the
distribution of allergens according to asthma groups was
analysed, sensitivity to pollens was significantly more
frequently detected in the asthma patients with SR (90.5%

and 10.6%, respectively; p<0.001). The distribution of
other allergens did not differ among defined asthma groups.

When PFTs of disease groups were compared, in the
asthma patients with SR, mean FVC (91.5+12.4% and
83.6+18.7%, respectively; p<0.01), FEV1 (89.1+14.2%
and 77.7+19.4%, respectively; p<0.001), and FEFs25 75
(76.9+22.5% and 63.5+24.4%; p<0.01) were higher than
the reference group. The lowest PFT values, although
the differences were not significant, were detected in the
asthma patients with Al (Table 3).

Table 4 demonstrates the distribution of the severity of
asthma in asthma groups. In asthma patients with SR, the
incidence of mild asthma was significantly higher (83.3% and
56.3%, respectively; p<0.001). Although moderate-tosevere degrees of asthma were encountered most
frequently in asthma patients with Al, differences were
not significant (52% and 43.7%, respectively; p>0.05).

In Table 5, the association between the severity of asthma
and the patient characteristics was demonstrated. When
moderate-severe asthma patients were compared with mild
asthma patients, prick test positivity (43.0% and 61.3%,
respectively; p<0.01), and pollen sensitivity (24.1% and
47.7%, respectively; p<0.001) were significantly lower.
Patients’ ages (41.6+14.4 years and 34.8+11.4 years,
respectively; p<0.001) and BMIs (26.2+5.2% and
24.9+4.4%; p<0.01) were higher in moderate-to- severe
degrees of asthma.

Independent association between the severity of asthma
and asthma phenotypes was investigated in logistic regression models. Asthma phenotypes and confounding factors
were included in models in which moderate-to-severe
asthma was the dependent variable and the group with
asthma alone was the reference group. The confounding
factors included were age, gender, the onset of asthma,
atopy, sensitivity to pollens, and BMI, which were related to
the severity of asthma and asthma phenotypes. According to
the results of the model shown in Table 6, a significant
negative association between moderate-to-severe asthma
and SR was detected (OR:0.6 95% Cl: 0.50.8).

Discussion

In this study, the association of the defined asthma
phenotypes with patient characteristics and the severity of
asthma were assessed. According to these assessments, in
patients with SR, significantly earlier onset of asthma,
better pulmonary functions and higher rates of atopy were
observed. The severity of asthma was milder in atopic
patients and among them those with pollen hypersensitivity;
and also, asthma became more severe with increasing in
patient’s age, age at onset of asthma, and BMI. In logistic
regression models, a negative association between
moderate-to-severe asthma and SR was detected. (OR:0.6
95% Cl: 0.5-0.8) Asthma associated with Al, although not
statistically significant, was more severe than the reference
asthma group.

Increased sensitivity to non-specific bronchial provocation
tests has been recognised in the pollen season in patients
with seasonal allergic rhinitis© and even asymptomatic
bronchial hyperactivity has been thought to be associated
with the development of asthma.° Within this context, the

concomitant presence of SR and asthma is not very
surprising. In this study, we found that the mean age of
asthma patients with SR at the time of diagnosis (31.9 yrs)
and also at the onset of their asthma (27.4 yrs) were found
to be significantly lower compared to the reference group.
In Western countries SR onsets relatively at an earlier age
(15 yrs),” while it was found to be 24.3 years in this study.
This finding can be related to the differences in herbal flora
in our country, ignorance of certain diseases and a cultural
tendency to look for medical help too late. On the other
hand, rhinitis is known to be an independent risk factor for
the development of asthma.® Therefore, earlier onset of
asthma associated with SR, compared with the patients with
asthma diagnosis alone, whose development is probably
under the influence of different environmental factors, can
be accepted as a natural phenomenon. In a study where
clinical features of asthma patients with SR, and persistent
asthma patients were compared, it was observed that in
asthma patients with SR, the values of FEV1 and FEF 25-75
were higher, and these patients were more symptomatic
despite better respiratory functions.’ Although symptoms of
patients in defined groups were not assessed, FVC, FEV1,
FEV1/FVC, FEF25-75 percentages were also found to be
significantly higher in asthma patients with SR compared to
the reference group in our study. Although not significantly
different from the reference group, the lowest values
for PFTs were observed in asthma patients with Al, while
asthma patients with CU had the best PFTs ranking after
those with SR.

Controversial results have been obtained from studies
investigating the association between asthma and atopy.
In developed countries, the prevalence of atopy, and asthma
increases concomitantly, '° while in developing countries the
increases in the prevalences of asthma and atopy do not
parallel each other.'' These findings indicate that in some
patients the development of asthma is not correlated with
atopy. In a meta-analysis of various epidemiological studies,
it was concluded that in only less than fifty percent of the
patients, the development of asthma could be attributed to
the presence of atopy.'* On the other hand, clinical
manifestations caused by different allergens can be different. Indoor inhalant allergens such as mites and cat epithels
were found to be more closely associated with asthma,
while pollens which are retained within the nasal mucosa,
and induce local allergic reactions because of their bigger
318

S. Celikel et al

 

sizes have been usually found to be related to rhinitis. '> In
this study, sensitivity to inhalant allergens was significantly
more pronounced in comparison with the reference group in
asthma patients with SR (92.9% and 28.8%, respectively).
When the distribution of allergen groups according to
defined groups was examined, the prevalance of pollen
sensitivity was significantly higher in asthma patients with
SR relative to the reference group (90.5% and 10.6,
respectively). There was no difference in the distribution
of other allergens among defined asthma groups. When a
high rate of pollen sensitivity in asthmatic patients with SR
was discarded, the most frequent inhalant allergen was
mite, which was in accordance with previous studies.
Asthma is a disease of variable severity. Severe and
uncontrolled asthma patients go to emergency room more
often, they are more frequently hospitalised and carry a risk
of death. Therefore, the detection of risk factors which
determine asthma severity is important for the treatment
and the prediction of the disease prognosis. Another issue
which should be known is that aetiological factors of a
disease, and those determining its severity are not always
identical. Asthma is one of the examplary diseases. Although
there are many epidemiological data which indicate an
association between atopy and prevalence and symptoms of
asthma, '’'4 the association between atopy and the severity
of asthma is more ambiguous. In our study when the
association between the patients’ characteristics and the
severity of asthma was evaluated, those with prick test
positivity had significantly milder asthma. When allergen
groups and the severity of asthma were investigated, pollensensitive patients were significantly associated with mild
asthma. Sensitivity to mites, animal epithel and fungi were
also more frequently seen in mild asthma compared to
moderate-to-severe asthma although the difference was not
significant. On this subject controversial information is
available in the literature. Analysis of TENOR (The Epidemiology and Natural History of Asthma: Outcomes and
Treatment Regimens) cohort which consists of severe or
difficult-to-treat asthma patients such as the ones prick test
positive, negative and those without prick test has showed
that 93.5% of the tested patients had positive prick tests.
Although these results might seem to suggest an association
between severe asthma and skin test positivity at first sight,
severity of asthma evaluated by FEV1 values, oral steroid
usage, hospitalisation rates, health costs and QoL scores did
not differ significantly among the three groups. '? In a study
where the patients from ENFUMOSA (The European Network
For Understanding Mechanisms Of Severe Asthma) cohort
were evaluated, a negative association was detected
between patients’ self-reported personal and familial
history of allergy and severe asthma.’ In a study where
paediatric patients recruited from the EGEA (Epidemiological study on the Genetics and Environment of Asthma) study
were investigated as for the relationship between allergic
sensitivity, total IgE, blood eosinophil counts and the
severity of asthma, no association was found between the
severity of asthma and sensitivity to any inhalant allergen or
allergen subgroups such as indoor or outdoor allergens, and
moulds.'” Similar findings were observed in adult studies.'*'? According to these outcomes, inhalent allergen
sensitivity known to be associated with the prevalence of
asthma seems to have no influence on the severity of

asthma. These results also support the hypothesis that the
development and the severity of asthma might be under the
influence of different environmental and genetic risk
factors.

Chronic urticaria is a skin disease, where migratory and
transient itchy plaques are frequently associated with angiooedema, and it persists longer than six weeks. The main
mediator in its pathogenesis is vasopermeability inducing
histamine and which is released from mast cells and
basophils. Moreover, the synthesis of cystenil leukotrienes
in basophils was increased in the sera of some patients with
CU, especially in patients with autologous serum test
positivity.2° On the other hand, histamine and leukotrienes
are also known to stimulate smooth muscles of the
respiratory tract leading to bronchospasm.”' There are also
some other reasons that the coexistence of two diseases can
be accepted as a conjunct outcome of multiple patogenetic
components rather than a coincidence.2*~4 Despite this
fact, studies investigating the coexistence of CU and asthma
are very few in number. In a study where 26 patients with CU
and 26 asthma patients as controls were enrolled, 22
patients with CU (85%) demonstrated bronchial hyperactivity and two of these patients (8%) were diagnosed with
asthma before the test. When compared with asthma
patients, bronchial hyperactivity in CU patients was found
to be milder.”° Bronchial hyperresponsiveness in CU patients
was explained by the results of two studies showing that the
immunopathology of CU was that of an eosinophil and
basophil cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction with a THO,
or a mixture of both TH1 and TH2 cytokine profile.7°’ Also,
in a study that consists of only 12 patients, none of the cases
showed bronchial hyperactivity.”® In a study conducted in
our clinic, the prevalence of asthma was found to be 16.4%
in CU patients with Al, while this rate was 8.4% in patients
without Al.?? In this study when asthma patients with CU
were compared with the reference asthma group, no
difference was detected in any of the demographic data
and parameters which potentially might have an impact on
the severity of asthma. However, they had a tendency to
demonstrate better pulmonary functions, milder asthma
severity, and higher rates of hypersensitivity to inhalant
alergens when compared with asthmatic patients with Al
and the reference group.

In many parts of the world, especially during the last
20-30 years, obesity has become an important health
problem, and its prevalence is increasing, particularly in
developed countries.°° The observation of a similar increase
in the prevalence of asthma has led to investigations
searching the association between these two disease states.
Many epidemiological studies and meta-analyses have
clearly revealed the association between obesity and
asthma, although existence of any causality in this association is still controversial.>"*2 In recent years the effects of
obesity on the management and severity of asthma have
been increasingly investigated. Using the data of the
National Asthma Survey, which was one of the most
comprehensive asthma studies performed in the United
States, obesity was found to be correlated with asthma
symptoms, school absenteism, drug usage, and GINA’s
classification of severity of asthma.*? In another study, after
corrections were performed for potential confounding
factors such as age; smoking status; FEV1; and bronchial

hyperactivity, obesity was considered as a risk factor for the
severity of asthma only in women.*4 On the other hand, ina
longitudinal study performed in Europe, no difference was
found among baseline BMls of the patients regarding asthma
severity. However, during follow-up, asthma patients who
remitted were observed to gain less weight.*° In this study,
when the severity of asthma was divided into the two
categories of mild and moderate-to-severe, the BMIs of the
moderate-to-severe asthma patients significantly exceed
those of the mild asthma patients (24.9+4.4 and 26.2+5.2,
respectively). It is known that BMI values between
25.00-29.99, and >30 are classified as overweight and
obesity, respectively. Interestingly, our findings demonstrated that BMls around but slightly higher than normal
limits (i.e. 26.2) were associated with moderate-to-severe
asthma, and the BMI values of the two severity groups could
probably be found over and below the accepted upper limit
of normal (i.e 25) healthy subjects (mild asthma: 20.5-29.3;
moderate-to-severe asthma 21.0-31.4 ). Our findings, and
previous data in the literature, give the impression that
obesity is associated with more severe asthma, worse
asthma control and lower quality of life scores, and suggest
that weight control should be an important target in the
monitorisation of asthma patients.

There are strong associations between asthma, persistent
rhinitis/sinusitis, nasal polyp(s) and Al. The prevalence of
nasal polyps in the population is 0.6%, 6-15% in asthma
patients and as high as 70% in analgesic intolerant asthma
(AIA) ,>:>” while rhinosinusitis is seen radiologically in nearly
all AIA patients.2® Since the response of AIA phenotype to
corticosteroids is generally poor, the asthma of these
patients is severe. In a study which used the cohort of the
TENOR study, it was seen that AIA patients had lower postbronchodilator FEV1 values and more severe clinical asthma,
used higher doses of oral and inhaled corticosteroids, and
were intubated more frequently.°? Also in our study, nasal
pathologies of the patients were evaluated in consideration
of their ENT operation history, and medical histories of
patients with Al revealed a significantly higher number of
ENT operations (29.3% vs. 11.3%). Because odds ratios of the
patients with Al varied between 1.4 and 1.9, and the lower
limits of 95% confidence interval were very close to 1 in
various models where severity of defined asthma groups
compared to reference group, although lacking statistical
significance, asthma patients with Al were thought to have
more severe forms of the disease as in accordance with the
literature findings. It seems that nasal symptoms and
physical finding of rhinosinusitis and/or polyp might be
inadequate in defining AIA while Al per se is a satisfactory
indicator of this disease state.

Since the number of severe asthma cases was too low (as
an example, severe asthma with SR was only one patient),
moderate and severe asthma categories had to be combined
in the logistic regression analysis. This might be the
limitation of analyses used for evaluating asthma severity.

As a conclusion, asthma associated with CU, which was
thought to be a new phenotype in our hypothesis, has not
manifested a distinct phenotypic feature. However, it was
observed that asthma associated with SR has a significantly
earlier onset with more frequent atopy, and milder severity.
Asthma associated with Al tends to be more severe.
Information concerning SR is original and provides hints

regarding the definition of a new phenotype. Our findings
indicate the importance of further investigations in this
field.
