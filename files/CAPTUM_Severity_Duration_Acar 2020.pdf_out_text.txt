Omalizumab for the Treatment of Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria in a Tertiary Center:

Real life experience in Turkey

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is defined as urticaria and/or angioedema that appears
spontaneously due to known or unknown causes and lasts for at least 6 weeks (1). The main
pathogenesis of CSU involves vasoactive mediators, primarily histamine, released from mast
cells and basophils. Other mechanisms in CSU pathogenesis are autoimmunity and anomalies
in basophil signal transduction and number (2). Modern second-generation H,-antihistamines
(AH) are the first-line therapy for urticaria. The 2017 revision of the urticaria guidelines from
the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology/Global Allergy and Asthma
European Network/European Dermatology Forum/World Allergy Organization
(EAACI/GA7LEN/EDF/WAO) recommends increasing ¢h@dose of second-generation Hj-AH
up to 4-fold as a second-line therapy for urticaria, Patients who do not respond to this
treatment receive omalizumab as third-line‘therapy (1). Omalizumab is a recombinant
humanized monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, that/binds to free IgE at the CH3 region of the ¢
chain near the binding sites for highsaffinity IgE receptor (FcERJ) and low-affinity IgE
receptor (CD23) (3). It reduces circulating free IgE level and prevents IgE from binding to
FcERI on the surface/of basophils, mast cells, and dendritic cells, resulting in downregulation
of FcERI (4).

Although the mechanism of the symptom-relieving effect of omalizumab in the treatment of
CSU is not fully understood, its postulated effects include reducing mast cell secretability,
correcting basopenia and basophil IgE receptor function, reducing the activity of IgG
autoantibodies against FcERI and IgE, reducing the activity of IgE antibodies against yet

unidentified antigens or autoantibodies, reducing the activity of intrinsic abnormal IgE, and
reducing the in vitro coagulation abnormalities associated with disease activity. However, it
has been emphasized that none of these potential factors can fully explain the mechanism of
action of omalizumab in CSU, and additional studies are needed to understand this
multifactorial effect (5,6,7).

The World Health Organization (WHO) approved the use of omalizumab in patients over 6
years of age who have moderate or severe asthma in 2013 (8) and in patients with persistent
urticaria in 2014 (9). Unlike asthma, the dose of omalizumab for CSU does not depend on IgE
level (2). In CSU, omalizumab is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 300 mg once
every 4 weeks (10). Headache, stomachache, and injection site reactions may oceur~An
advantage is that laboratory follow-up is not required during treatment (10). In.this study, we
retrospectively present the outcomes of CSU patients treated with omalizumab in our clinic in

a tertiary healthcare center.

Materials and Methods:

A total of 140 patients who were followed‘in our clinic and used omalizumab between
September 2013 and January 2018 were.retrospectively evaluated. Of these, 86 patients
diagnosed with CSU for whom current‘data could be obtained were included in the study.
From medical records, we recorded data regarding the patients’ age, sex, duration of urticaria,
treatments for urticaria"before*omalizumab therapy, presence of comorbid diseases, urticaria
activity score over 7 days (UAS7) before and after omalizumab treatment, number of
omalizumab doses and duration of treatment, relapses and time to relapse, duration of
remission in patients who discontinued treatment, and adverse effects. Permission from local
ethics committee was taken.

Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 25.0 software. Descriptive continuous

variables were expressed using mean, standard deviation, maximum and minimum, while
categorical variables were expressed in frequency and percent distribution values. Wilcoxon
test was used to analyze dependent samples. The relationship between time to relapse and
presence of comorbidities was evaluated using Kaplan—Meier analysis. Pairwise analysis of
the groups was performed using log rank test. The relationship between urticaria duration and
the relapse was evaluated using Cox regression analysis, while the relationship between

urticaria duration and remission was evaluated using Mann—Whitney U test.

Results

The patient group included 23 (26.7%) men and 63 (73.3%) women with a meathageof
45.5+14.3 years (19-74 years). The mean duration of urticaria before initiation of
omalizumab therapy was 54.5467 months (5480 months) (Table -1) “All patients used
second-generation H;-AH before omalizumab therapy. The distribution of treatments used
before omalizumab treatment is summarized in Table-2¢

Omalizumab therapy was initiated at a dose of 800 mg once every 4 weeks for all patients.
Depending on the severity of urticaria symptoms during follow-up, intervals of omalizumab
decreased to 2 weeks or increased to 6-8yweeks in some patients (Table-3). For one of the
patients treated at 2-4 week intervals, tréatment was later discontinued due to nonresponse.
The other patient who received omalizumab at 2-4 week intervals had previously shown no
response to high-dose AH, cérticosteroids (CS), methotrexate, or cyclosporine-A (Cyc-A)
treatment and received the most treatment (56 doses).

Mean number of omalizumab doses received was 11.9+9.3 (1-56 doses) and the mean
duration of treatment was 13.3+10.4 months (Table-1).

Twenty-six patients (30.2%) used no additional treatment during omalizumab therapy, while

51 patients (59.3%) used AH, 3 (3.5%) used AH and leukotriene receptor antagonist
(LTA), and 6 (6.9%) used colchicine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or CS either alone
or in combination.

The mean UAS7 score before omalizumab therapy was 38.9+4.1. The mean UAS7 score after
treatment was 7.9+10.5 (Table-1). The decrease in mean UAS7 with omalizumab therapy was
statistically significant (p:0.000). Patient distributions according to UAS-7 scores before and
after omalizumab are shown in the Table-4. For 10 patients (11.6%) with UAS7 of 28-42
after omalizumab, therapy was discontinued due to nonresponse or loss of effect Frable-S}.
Forty patients (46.5%) who had a UAS7 of 0 after omalizumab therapy were considered
complete response and 36 patients (41.8%) with UAS7 of 7-21 were considered partially
responsive to treatment. Of 27 patients who restarted omalizumab therapy due‘o relapse after
discontinuation of treatment, complete response was obtained in 15,(55.6%) and partial
response in the remaining 12 (44.4%) patients.

Thirty-one (56.3%) of the 55 patients who discontinued/omalizumab therapy relapsed.
Omalizumab therapy was reinitiated in these patients\and discontinued again when their
symptoms resolved. However, while 5 patients experienced no further relapses, 2 patients
relapsed twice and 3 patients relapsedthreestimes. Four patients did not appear for their
scheduled follow-up visits. When contatted by phone, 2 of those patients stated that they had
relapsed but were unable torattend:their follow-up appointment, | patient reported that their
symptoms were under control with CS and AH, and 1 patient stated that they were receiving
alternative nonmedical treatment and did not want to use medication again. In patients with a
single relapses the mean time to relapse was 3.2+2.5 months (1—12 months). In patients who
experienced a second relapse, the mean time to second relapse was 2.5+0.4 months (2-3
months). In the 5 patients who had a second relapse, the symptom-free period before the
second relapse was significantly longer than that before the first relapse (p=0.043). In patients

who had a third relapse, the mean time to third relapse was 341.7 months (2—5 months).
Twenty-four patients (43.6%) did not relapse after discontinuing omalizumab. The mean
relapse-free period in these patients was 12.23+9.9 months (2-36 months). Thirty-one patients
could not be evaluated in terms of relapse because treatment was ongoing or discontinued due
to nonresponse/adverse effects. In 5 patients who relapsed once, treatment was successfully
discontinued with no further recurrence. In these patients, the mean relapse-free period was
642.9 months (3—10 months). Urticaria duration was not statistically associated with time to
relapse (p=0.798). There was no significant difference in urticaria duration between the 29
patients who had remission and the other patients (median 30 months vs. 36 months,
respectively; p=0.98).

Four patients (4.65%) experienced adverse events. Adverse events included | patient with
injection site reaction characterized by erythematous/edematous plaque formation at the
injection site that lasted 3-4 days after each injection, | patienf'yertigo, and 2 patients with
asthenia and drowsiness. Treatment was discontinued in’1 ofthe patients who developed
asthenia and drowsiness (1.2%) due to the negative impact on their daily life (Table 4).
Reasons for discontinuing omalizumab treatment can be summarized as; remission (29
patients, 33.7%), unresponsive to treatment(7//patients, 8.1%), loss of treatment effect (3
patients, 3.5%), lost to follow-up orrefuSing treatment (4 patients 4.6%), adverse effect (1
patient, 1.2%).

The most common comorbidities accompanying urticaria in our patients were thyroid
dysfunction (14 patients, 16.3%), diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance (9 patients, 10.5%),
hypertension (7 patients, 8.1%), asthma (5 patients, 5.8%), and rheumatic diseases (3 patients,
3.5%). In addition, there were 2 patients (2.3%) with epilepsy, 2 (2.3%) with malignancy (1
breast cancer and | ovarian cancer), 2 (2.3%) with urinary tract diseases (recurrent urinary
tract infection and vesicoureteral reflux), and | patient (1.2%) each with vitiligo, alopecia

universalis, allergic rhinitis, myasthenia gravis, gastritis, depression, herniated disc,
polycythemia, parasitosis, and hepatosteatosis. There was no association between
comorbidities and relapse-free period (p=0.687). Forty-one patients (47.7%) had no
comorbidities.

Discussion

Phase 3 placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that omalizumab is safe and effective in
eliminating the symptoms of AH-resistant CSU (11-13). Groups using 300 mg omalizumab in
the studies had mean ages ranged from 39 to 47.8 (11-16). The female ratio in the studies are
73.8% (11), 74.1% (12), 80% (13), 72% (14), 63.6% (15), 57.7% (16). Similarly, in ourstudy
the mean age was 45.5 years and 73.3% of the patients were women.

The mean time to urticaria diagnosis was found as 73.2 months (13), 44 months (14), 54
months (17) in the literature and 54.5 months in our study.

Wilches et al. reported 46.1% of the patients used H- and/or Hj-AH alone prior to
omalizumab treatment (16). In our study, the proportion6fipatients who used AH
monotherapy prior to omalizumab treatment was 39.5%, CS, LTA and immunosuppressive
treatments prior to omalizumab were 57.9%, 57.5%», 9.5% in the study by Kaplan et al (11)
62.1%, 0.8%, 14.4% (Cyc-A) in the sudy by Bulur at al (15). In our study, these percentages
were 41.8%, 20.9%, and 5.8%, respectively.

UAS7 score prior to omalizumab was reported as 31.2 (11), 31.3 (12), and 29.5 (13) in the
studies, whereas UAS7 priomto omalizumab was 38.9 in our study. Bulur et al. reported a
decrease in mean UAS7 score from 30.5 to 1.5 (15), while we observed a decline from 38.9 to
7.9.

In the retrospective study by Tiirk et al. evaluating 25 CSU patients treated with omalizumab,
the most common comorbidities were hypothyroidism (20%), asthma (16%), diabetes mellitus
(8%), and rheumatic diseases (4%) (14). In a study in Ecuador evaluating 23 CSU patients,

the prevalence of thyroid comorbidities was 38.5% (16). The most common comorbidities in
our study were thyroid dysfunction (17.4%), asthma (5.8%), diabetes mellitus (9.3%), and
rheumatic diseases (3.5%).

Tiirk et al. reported relapse in 61% of patients after discontinuing omalizumab due to good
treatment response, and of these patients, 50% showed complete response and 50% showed
partial response upon restarting omalizumab therapy (14). In a retrospective analysis of 137
CSU patients treated with omalizumab at doses of 150 mg every 2 weeks or 300 mg every 4
weeks, Ghazanfar et al. reported that 58% of patients whose treatment was discontinued upon
remission required omalizumab treatment again due to recurrence of symptoms (18). In‘our
study, relapse was observed in 31 (56.4%) of 55 patients whose treatment was discontinued
due to remission, and of those who subsequently restarted omalizumab treatment) complete or
partial response was observed in 55.6% and 44.4%, respectively. Ghazanfar et al. observed
near complete response in 67%, partial response in 22%, and nonresponse or limited response
in 11% of their patients (18). Tiirk et al. reported a nonresponse,rate of 8% in their study (14).
In our study, treatment was discontinued due to.nonresponse in 8.1% of the patients and due
to loss of effect in 3.5% of the patients. Ghazanfar et al. reported that 7% of patients showed
long-term remission and did not need to.restart omalizumab therapy (18), while this
proportion was 33.7% (n=29) in our, study. Of these 29 patients, 5 had previously relapsed,
but no further recurrence was detected after discontinuing omalizumab treatment for the
second time.

Although its incidence\is as a rare as 0.2%, the most fearful adverse effect of omalizumab is
anaphylaxis. Because the risk of anaphylaxis is higher in the first 2 hours after the first 3
injections and in the first 30 minutes after subsequent injections, it is recommended to
observe patients closely at these times (19). None of the patients in our study developed
anaphylaxis. The most common adverse events associated with omalizumab are injection site

reaction and upper abdominal pain (8). Kaplan et al. reported that headache and upper
respiratory tract infections were more common in the group that received 300 mg omalizumab
than the placebo group (11). In the study by Ghazanfar et al., the prevalence of adverse events
was 6.6% (18). In a study by Bhutani et al. evaluating omalizumab treatment in 99 patients
with allergic asthma, | patient (1%) had vertigo and drowsiness (20). The frequency of
adverse events in our study was 4.6%. In one patient, injection site reaction was observed in
the form of erythematous/edematous plaque lesion at the injection site that persisted for 3-4
days after injection. One patient (1.16%) had vertigo and 2 patients (2.3%) had asthenia and
drowsiness. For one of the latter patients, treatment was discontinued due to its impact on
their daily life.

It should be kept in mind that omalizumab is a symptomatic treatment, and symptoms often
recur when such treatments are discontinued (7). Unlike asthma, IgE ‘level is not associated
with treatment efficacy in chronic urticaria, which suggests that, omalizumab exerts a
nonspecific activity on mast cells, although it should also*be remembered that IgE level is
related to omalizumab effectiveness via different routessin asthma and chronic urticaria (7).
Tiirk et al. determined that omalizumab is‘effectivetin patients who previously responded well
to omalizumab treatment and later relapsed, and proposed that antinuclear antibody (ANA)
positivity may be associated with treatment resistance and relapse (14). In the present study,
we found that omalizumab.was, effective in both CSU patients receiving it for the first time
and those whose treatmentewas discontinued and reinitiated later due to relapse. Limitations
of this study is due tojits retrospective nature body mass index (BMI) data of some patients

were lacking\so we could not correlate omalizumab response with BMI.
