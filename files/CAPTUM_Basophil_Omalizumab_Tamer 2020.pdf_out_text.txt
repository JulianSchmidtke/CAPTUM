Omalizumab does not lead to a distinct alteration in hematological parameters and

complete blood count-derived inflammation biomarkers except for basophil count

ABSTRACT

Purpose: Omalizumab is a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody which is used to treat patients with
chronic spontaneous urticaria by decreasing free IgE levels. Omalizumab may have an antiinflammatory effect by inhibiting T-cell activation and inducing eosinophil apoptosis. Within
this study, we evaluated the effect of omalizumab on hematological parameters and

inflammation biomarkers in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria.

Methods: Between July 2018 and November 2019, medical records, of 60 patients (44 female,
16 male) with chronic spontaneous urticaria who were gtfeatede with omalizumab were
reviewed retrospectively. Hematological parameters and inflammation biomarkers including
the neutrophil/lymphocyte, monocyte/lymphoeyte, \platelet/lymphocyte and mean platelet
volume/platelet count ratios were compared before and after 12 weeks of omalizumab

treatment.

Results: The absolute count of basophils and percentage of basophils increased significantly
after omalizumab treatment (p=, 0.04, p= 0.004). The absolute count of eosinophils,
percentage of eosinophils, neutrophil/lymphocyte, monocyte/lymphocyte, and mean platelet
volume/platélet_ratios decreased, while platelet/lymphocyte ratio increased after omalizumab

treatment. Nevertheless, these changes were not statistically significant.

Conclusions: Increased basophil counts suggest that omalizumab has a crucial effect through
basophils in chronic spontaneous urticaria. Further studies focusing on basophils may
contribute to the literature both to elucidate the etiopathogenesis of urticaria and to improve

novel treatment agents for the disease. On the other hand, our study revealed that omalizumab
did not have a distinct effect on complete blood count derived inflammation biomarkers and

thus inflammation.

Introduction

Chronic spontaneous urticaria describes urticaria lasting for at least six weeks without a
determined cause’. It presents with erythematous itchy plaques or accompanying angioedema.
Moreover, it compromises the patients’ quality of life significantly’. The etiopathogehesis of
chronic spontaneous urticaria is complex. Mast cells release various mediators) like histamine,
proteases, cytokines, platelet activating factor, prostaglandin D2, leukotrienes C4, D4 and E4.
Thus, vasodilation, increased vascular permeability and sefisorymerve ending stimulation
result in urticarial plaques and angioedema. Perivascular? infiltration of lymphocytes,
monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils have\been identified in the histopathology
of urticarial plaques. Nevertheless, the impact of eosinophils, lymphocytes and neutrophils on
disease pathology has not been elucidatedwIt has been suggested that activation of IgE
receptors on basophils might lead to,histamine and cytokine synthesis. Blood basophil counts
decrease in chronic spontaneouseurticaria patients who have active disease, since basophils

migrate to skin lesions’.

Omalizumabus.a monoclonal anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody used in the treatment of
chronic spontaneous urticaria which is resistant to Hj-antihistamines. Omalizumab decreases
free IgE concentrations and downregulates FceRI receptors on basophils and mast cells*. It
has been suggested that omalizumab might reverse decreased basophil counts and maintain
mast cell stabilization’. Furthermore, omalizumab may have an anti-inflammatory effect by

both inhibiting T-cell activation and inducing eosinophil apoptosis’. However, exact
mechanism of action of omalizumab in the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria has not

been fully understood’.

Various biomarkers have been reported in the management of patients with chronic
spontaneous urticaria. For instance, high serum C-reactive protein levels and mean platelet
volume have been associated with disease severity. Total IgE levels have been used to predict
omalizumab treatment outcome*’. Serum transglutaminase-2 have been proposed as a
biomarker to evaluate the efficacy of omalizumab treatment”. Moreover, decrease in white
blood cell count, platelet count, neutrophil count, neutrophil/lymphocyte,
neutrophil/monocyte and platelet/lymphocyte ratios and increase in mean platelet\volume and
eosinophil count have been reported in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria treated

with omalizumab®”.

Within this study, we evaluated the effect of omalizumab‘on hematological parameters and
inflammation biomarkers in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria. These results will
contribute to the medical literature to establish both*the mechanism of action of omalizumab
and parameters used in the follow up omalizumab treatment in chronic spontaneous urticaria

patients.

Materials and methods

The study ineluded=60 patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria who were admitted to the
dermatology outpatient clinic and treated with omalizumab between July 2018 and November
2019. Local ethics committee approval was obtained (No: 2019-380). Medical records of the
patients were reviewed retrospectively. Omalizumab was administered at a dose of 300 mg
subcutaneously every four weeks. Patients were not using any drug other than omalizumab;

such as doxepin, cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Laboratory test results of the patients were
evaluated before the initiation of omalizumab treatment, and 12 weeks after omalizumab
treatment. Hematological parameters and inflammation biomarkers including the
neutrophil/lymphocyte, monocyte/lymphocyte, platelet/lymphocyte and mean platelet
volume/platelet count ratios were analyzed*. Fasting venous blood samples were obtained
from all patients. The measurement after venipuncture was performed immediately and the
results were obtained within four hours. Blood cell counts were analyzed using the Cell-Dyn
Ruby system. The exclusion criteria were hematological disorder, chronic inflammatory

disorder, infectious disease and malignancy.

Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 22.0 statistical package ‘program.

 

Continuous variables were defined as the mean (+) standard deviation and medians
(minimum—maximum). Categorical variables were expressed as percentages. Kolmogorov—
Smirnov test was used to check the distribution of pre-treatmentiand post-treatment values for
normality. Paired sample t-test was used to compare/ normally distributed values. The
Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare*the data which was not normally distributed.

The p-value <0.05 was considered significant,

Results

The study included 60 patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria; 44 (73.3%) female and 16

 

(26.7%) male. The mean age of the patients was 47.8415.1 years (range: 18-72 years). The

 

mean disease duration was 40.5+35.7 months (range: 7-156 months).

The absolute counts of neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes were similar before and after
omalizumab treatment. However, the absolute count of basophils increased significantly after
omalizumab treatment (p= 0.04). The percentages of neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes

were similar before and after omalizumab treatment. However, the percentage of basophils
increased significantly after omalizumab treatment (p= 0.004). Furthermore, the absolute
count and percentage of eosinophils were decreased. Nevertheless, the decrease in blood
eosinophil count was not statistically significant (p=0.956 and p=0.959, respectively) (Table

1).

Serum hemoglobin, hematocrit and mean corpuscular hemoglobin levels, white blood cell
count, red blood cell count, mean corpuscular volume, mean platelet volume and platelet
distribution width were similar before and after omalizumab treatment. Platelet count

decreased after omalizumab, however, it was not statistically significant (p=0.109) (Fable2).

Inflammation biomarkers including the neutrophil/lymphocyte, monocyte/lymphocyte, and
mean platelet volume/platelet ratios decreased, while platelet/lymphoeyte ratio increased after
12 weeks of omalizumab treatment. Nevertheless, the changes, were not statistically

significant (Table 3).

Discussion

Chronic spontaneous urticaria effects 1%, of the population worldwide. Patients with chronic
spontaneous urticaria are usually“treated by H1 antihistamines symptomatically’. However,
60% of the patients dof/not «espond to H1 antihistamines adequately’. Omalizumab is
regarded as a safe.and effective treatment option in patients resistant to high dose H1
antihistamineés,,Omalizumab mainly prevents binding free serum IgE to FceRI receptors on
basophils and\mast cells. Nevertheless, various mechanisms of action of omalizumab have
been proposed in the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria. Despite the role of basophils
in the etiopathogenesis of chronic spontaneous urticaria remains unclarified, accumulation of
peripheral basophils within cutaneous lesions has been shown in active disease’. Thus,

peripheral basophils are significantly reduced in blood samples of patients with active chronic
spontaneous urticaria’’. It has been suggested that omalizumab might prevent cutaneous
migration of basophils via chemokine receptors’. In addition, vascular endothelial growth
factor released primarily by eosinophils facilitates the vascular permeability in the
pathogenesis of chronic spontaneous urticaria’*. As omalizumab has been reported to be
leading to eosinophil apoptosis, it has been suggested that omalizumab might have an effect in

the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria by decreasing serum total eosinophil count!*"*,

Moreover, basophil count, platelet count, infammatory markers like C-reactive protein and
mean platelet volume have been associated with disease severity'*'’. However, ityis*a, matter
of debate if omalizumab may alter hematological parameters, has an antiinflammatory effect
and decreases the serum levels of inflammation biomarkers in patients) with chronic
spontaneous urticaria. Acer et al. reported that the ratios of neutrophil’ to lymphocyte and
platelet to lymphocyte decreased in chronic spontaneous urticatia patients after three months
of omalizumab treatment administered 300 mg/month subcutaneously. Moreover, Acer et al.
reported decrease in white blood cell, platelét and neutrophil counts and increase in mean
platelet volume and eosinophil count after-omalizumab treatment. Increase in basophil count
was also observed, however, the difference’ was not statistically significant’. Onder et al.
reported a decrease in neutrophil/lymphocyte and neutrophil/monocyte ratios in patients with
chronic spontaneous urticaria after 12 weeks of omalizumab treatment at a dose of 300 mg
monthly. Nevertheless, platelet/lymphocyte and lymphocyte/monocyte ratios did not change
significantly,.after.omalizumab treatment. Furthermore, Onder et al. reported decreased
neutrophil counts and similar eosinophil, basophil and platelet counts after omalizumab
treatment’. Ertas et al. reported that neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio decreased whereas, mean
platelet volume, platelet distribution width and mean platelet volume/platelet count increased

in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria after 12 weeks of subcutaneous injection of 300
mg omalizumab every four weeks. However, no significant difference has been observed on

platelet/lymphocyte ratio after omalizumab treatment’,

In the light of these information, we evaluated the effect of omalizumab on hematologic
parameters in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria. The absolute count and percentage
of basophils increased significantly at the end of 12-week of omalizumab treatment (p=0.04,
p= 0.004). The absolute count and percentage of eosinophils decreased. However, the
decrease in blood eosinophils was not statistically significant (p=0.956, p=0.959). The
absolute counts and percentages of neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes were alSo,similar
before and after omalizumab treatment. Platelet activation has been correlated with chronic
urticaria, previously”. We observed a slight decrease in platelet count after omalizumab
treatment (p=0.109). However, our results indicated no significanf‘alteration in mean platelet
volume, platelet distribution width or platelet count after treatment. Within this study,
neutrophil/lymphocyte, monocyte/lymphocyte and mean)platelet volume/platelet ratios
decreased whereas, platelet/lymphocyte ratio increased after omalizumab treatment. However,
the differences that we observed in \neutrophil/lymphocyte, monocyte/lymphocyte,
platelet/lymphocyte and mean platelet volume/platelet ratios before the initiation and after 12
weeks of omalizumab treatment. were not statistically significant. Decrease in
neutrophil/lymphocyte, platelet/lymphocyte and neutrophil/monocyte ratios due to
omalizumab have been reported previously®”"*, However, our results revealed that
omalizumab,had ‘no effect on complete blood count-derived inflammation biomarkers in
patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria.

In conclusion, omalizumab did not lead to a distinct alteration in hematological parameters
and complete blood count-derived inflammation parameters except for basophil counts in
patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria. Increased basophil counts suggest that

omalizumab may have a crucial effect through basophils in chronic spontaneous urticaria.
Omalizumab may increase the number of peripheral basophils as a result of inhibition of
intake of basophils from circulation to skin lesions. Further studies focusing on the effect of
omalizumab through basophils may contribute to the medical literature to elucidate the
etiopathogenesis of urticaria and to improve novel treatment agents for the disease. Basophil
counts may be useful in the follow-up of omalizumab treatment in addition to inflammation

biomarkers in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria.
