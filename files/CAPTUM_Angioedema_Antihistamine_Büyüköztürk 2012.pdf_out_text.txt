ABSTRACT

Treatment of chronic urticaria consists of antihistamines as the first-line treatment. For more severe symptoms, combinations can be necessary as well as dose augmentations. The recent guidelines suggest the possibility of using omalizumab in resistant cases, but this therapy is still investigational. We treated two patients with idiopathic recurrent
angioedema and 12 patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) with omalizumab, who had not benefited from the
recommended first-line, second-line and third-line treatments. To evaluate the efficacy of the omalizumab treatment, urticaria activity scores (UAS) and chronic urticaria quality of life (CU-Q2oL) scores were measured at baseline, and at the
end of the first and sixth month of the therapy. The dosage and intervals of omalizumab therapy were determined according to the rules suggested for severe asthma treatment. CU-Q2oL scores and UAS displayed significant improvements in
all 14 patients. None of the patients reported any adverse effect during the treatment until the submission of this data.
Our results show that omalizumab apparently improves CU-Q2oL as well as UAS in treatment-resistant CSU in a real life

setting.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a severe skin disease characterized by
itchy wheals and/or angioedema. In the current guideline of
The European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology
(EAACI), the European Union-funded Network of Excellence, the
Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA?LEN), the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) and the World Allergy Organization (WAO), chronic idiopathic urticaria in which wheals develop
independently from external stimuli is renamed as chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU)."

Treatment of CU consists of the use of antihistamines and, at
exacerbations, corticosteroids. In mild cases, symptoms easily
respond to a once daily dose of antihistamines. The current standard therapy with regular dosed H,-antihistamines leads to an
absence of symptoms in less than 50% of patients with CSU.
Increasing the dose improves treatment responses but still every
third to fourth patient will remain symptomatic. For more severe
symptoms, combinations can be necessary as well as dose
augmentations. The severe form of CU needs corticosteroid cures
when an exacerbation occurs. In those patients who require
frequent corticosteroid cures, other alternatives must be tried.

angioedema, chronic urticaria, hives, omalizumab, quality of life.

Cyclosporin is such an alternative and demonstrated to be effective
in some patients. The guidelines suggest the possibility of using
omalizumab in resistant cases.”

Omalizumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to immunoglobulin (Ig)E and inhibits its binding to FceRI
on the surface of mast cells and basophils.° Treatment with omalizumab is currently included in international guidelines on asthma
management, as the fifth step drug. Apart from asthma, in 2007, it
was noted by two different groups that omalizumab had been
found effective in treatment-resistant CU and recurrent idiopathic
angioedema patients.*° One year later, Kaplan et al.° published a
placebo controlled study demonstrating the effectiveness of omalizumab in antihistamine unresponsive CU. Eventually, the EAACI/
GA°LEN/EDF/WAO guideline in 2009 suggested omalizumab as a
fourth-line option in the treatment of CU. Very recently, Groffik
et al.’ published their nine CSU patients who responded well to
omalizumab treatment.

In our allergy department, two patients with idiopathic recurrent
angioedema and 12 patients with CSU who had not benefited from
the recommended first-line, second-line and third-line treatments
have been treated with the off-label use of omalizumab. The urticaria activity scores (UAS) and CU quality of life (CU-Q2o0L) scores

of the patients meaningfully improved with this treatment. We
intend to present our experiences and to discuss the use of omalizumab in the treatment of resistant CSU.

METHODS

Twelve CU patients were suffering from daily wheals for periods
ranging from 8 months to 30 years (Table 1). Their clinical situations
were evaluated according to the EAACI/GA?LEN/EDF/WAO guideline for the definition, classification and diagnosis of urticaria."
Accordingly, two patients were diagnosed as idiopathic recurrent
angioedema and 12 patients as CSU. None of the patients experienced other types of urticaria, except one patient with CSU (no. 13)
who had occasional angioedema attacks. Clinical and laboratory
examinations including differential blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, routine biochemistry and serological tests for autoimmune diseases did not reveal any underlying cause or illness
except in two patients. These two patients had positive autologous
serum skin test (ASST) results as well as moderately high levels of
anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies. None of the patients gave a satisfactory response either to maximal dose and combined antihistamine therapy or elimination diet for allergenic foods and food
additives. Three patients were symptomatic despite cyclosporin
treatment for 3 months.

Apart from CU patients, two patients (nos. 1 and 2) had
frequent and severe angioedema attacks for many years
(10-15 years) despite regular prophylactic antihistamine therapy.
During these attacks, which infrequently involved laryngeal
mucosa, they had to be treated with high-dose parenteral corticosteroids. All the laboratory examinations including C1 inhibitor,
C1q, C4, antinuclear antibodies, antithyroid antibodies and ASST
were within normal limits. Patient no. 1 had a cushingoid appearance, osteoporosis and impaired fasting glucose because of the
frequent corticosteroid use and also did not get benefit from danazol and colchicine therapy. Treatment with methotrexate, cyclo

sporin, danazol as well as i.v. Ig was ineffective in the other patient
with resistant angioedema.

As this medication is not legally indicated for use in CU, we
requested the permission of the Ministry of Health for prescribing
omalizumab to our patients. After obtaining the permission for every
individual and their informed written consents, omalizumab was
started in all the patients. The dosage of the drug was calculated
based on the IgE levels and bodyweights as it is suggested for
severe asthma treatment. The initial intervals between the drug
applications were planned to be 4 weeks, except in three cases
(nos. 3, 7 and 8; 2-week intervals). After clinical benefit was
achieved in these two patients, the drug application intervals were
extended to 4 weeks.

Urticaria activity scores and CU-Q2oL scores of the patients
were obtained at baseline, and at the end of the first and the sixth
month of omalizumab therapy. The UAS is a composite scoring system based on the patient’s diary by using numeric severity ratings
from 0 to 3 (0, none; 3, intense) for the number of wheals per 24 h
and the intensity of pruritus. The total daily score (sum of the wheal
and pruritus scores) could therefore assume any value between 0
and 6." In this study the weekly aggregate score calculated as the
sum of the daily UAS self-evaluation scores of 7 individual days was
used. CU-Q2oL has been specifically developed for use in patients
with CU and encompasses the physical, emotional, social and practical domains that characterize this condition.° The Turkish version
of the CU-Q2oL was recently validated by Kocattirk et al.'° It
consists of 23 items categorized under the following scales: pruritus, swelling, impact on life activities, sleep problems, limits and
looks.

Statistical analyses

Data were analyzed with SPSS ver. 15.0 for Windows. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to evaluate the differences between
the baseline and after-treatment scores of UAS and CU-Q2oL
questionnaires.

RESULTS

Angioedema attacks completely ceased immediately after the first
injection of omalizumab in patient no. 2, while the symptoms
gradually decreased until its disappearance after the fourth dose
in patient no. 1.

Twelve patients with treatment-resistant CSU exceptionally
responded to omalizumab almost at the first week after the beginning of the first doses. UAS and total CU-Q2o0L scores displayed
significant improvements at the end of the first month in all 14
patients (P < 0.000 for both). These response levels persisted at the
sixth month control (Figs 1,2). The differences in the scores of first
month CU-Q2oL questionnaires were significant in all subscales
compared to the baseline values (Table 2). Beyond the improvement
in the scores, most of the patients declared that they did not need
to take antihistamines anymore. No patients reported any adverse
effect during the treatment until the submission of this data.

DISCUSSION

Patients with CU suffer from strongly impaired quality of life (QoL).
In addition to the classical clinical symptoms like pruritus, wheals
and the occurrence of angioedema, many other factors such as
the unpredictability of the attacks, lack of quality sleep and fatigue

are of major importance for patients with CSU.'' Furthermore,
most of the patients avoid a great variety of foods because of the
concern of triggering an urticaria attack, which may lead to a further burden. It was demonstrated that CSU patients suffer in many
aspects a comparable QoL impairment as patients with severe
coronary artery disease waiting for bypass surgery.'* A great number of studies demonstrated QoL impairments in CU patients and
emphasized its importance.'*"® We observed very significant QoL
improvements in our patients receiving omalizumab therapy.
These improvements included all scales of the CU-Q2oL instrument. Previously, similar improvements, especially in the functional
capacity and well-being of patients with CU, have been demonstrated by using the daily quality of life index (DLQI)® and Skindex29 questionnaires."° Recently, Vestergaard and Deleuran'”
described two patients with severe CU whose UAS and DLQI had
markedly reduced 4 weeks after the omalizumab therapy. Very
recently, Maurer et al.'® clearly showed that omalizumab was an
effective treatment option for patients with CU with IgE autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase who are refractory to conventional treatment. They used three different QoL questionnaires
(DLQI, Skindex and CU-Q2oL) and found that all three revealed a
significantly greater improvement of QoL for patients receiving
omalizumab compared with placebo.

Another noteworthy observation was that the benefit of omalizumab treatment emerged markedly as early as the first week after
the initial dose in the majority of the patients. Similar observations
were reported previously.*"'® Maurer et al. pointed that a decrease
in UAS was observed during the first week of therapy and continued
until the end of the study. Equally important, omalizumab had markedly reduced the burden of repeated rescue medication use in their
study patients. Although we did not calculate the decrease in medication use, our patients also reported that they had not needed rescue medication since the beginning of the omalizumab therapy.

To explain the efficacy of omalizumab in CSU, Kaplan et al.° suggested that omalizumab can reduce the expression of FceRI on the
surface of basophils and prevent both IgG antibody-mediated
cross-linking in chronic autoimmune urticaria and the release of
mast cell mediators. Noga et al. '® added to this body of knowledge
by showing that the anti-inflammatory activity of omalizumab
depended on the induction of eosinophil apoptosis and the downregulation of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-13.

441
S. Biiyiikéztiirk et al.

lemoli et al.?° suggested a new immunomodulator mechanism of

anti-IgE therapy characterized by a reduction in B-cell activation
and homing and tumor necrosis factor-« and IL-4 production and
an increase in y-interferon synthesis. Recently, downregulation of
FceRI was observed in association with significant clinical improvement and discontinuation of immunosuppressive medications in a
patient with CSU treated by omalizumab.”"

Omalizumab therapy was very well tolerated by the 14 patients
of our series. They were eager to continue to the treatment at subsequent visits. During the follow-up period of therapy, we did not
observe any adverse effect. A similar safety profile for omalizumab
in CSU was reported by other authors.°”""8

There is an uncertainty about how long omalizumab therapy
should be continued in CU patients. Although in personal communications with experts in CU prolonged time intervals between doses
compared with asthma treatment protocol were advised, we could
not reach those time periods. When we tried to extend the treatment
intervals gradually, only some patients tolerated 6-week intervals
while the others needed to take their doses every month at that
time. None of the patients tolerated 8-week intervals. Therefore, we
can comment that an individual treatment plan must be applied for
every patient.

In conclusion, we propose that omalizumab is a promising treatment agent in treatment-resistant CSU and idiopathic angioedema
patients who feel hopeless and restricted because of their disease.
Although an increasing number of reports demonstrating the utility
of omalizumab in patients with refractory CU have appeared
recently in the medical published work, this therapy is still investigational. Although placebo control is lacking, our results clearly show
that omalizumab therapy is also effective in a real-life setting for
refractory CSU and idiopathic angioedema.
