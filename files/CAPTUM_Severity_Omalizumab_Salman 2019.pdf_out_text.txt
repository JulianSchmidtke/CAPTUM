Abstract

Background: Omalizumab is a third-line treatment for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). Studies investigating the use of
higher doses of omalizumab in patients unresponsive to regular doses are limited.

Objectives: This study aims to investigate the effectiveness and safety of omalizumab 450 mg in CSU.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. The response to therapy was evaluated using the Urticaria Activity
Score over 7 days (UAS7) and the Urticaria Control Test (UCT). Patients showing complete response (CR) (UAS7: 0-1) to
omalizumab 300 mg (Group |) and patients receiving at least 3 doses of omalizumab 450 mg (Group 2) between 2016 and
2018 were included.

Results: A total of 72 patients (Group |: 59; Group 2: 13) were included. In Group 2, the mean UAS7 score decreased from
18.6 to 5.1 and the mean UCT score increased from 8.6 to 12 after a mean 4.3 courses of 450 mg omalizumab treatment.
Of the 13 patients in Group 2, 6 had CR and 3 had good disease control (UAS7: 2-6). The rate of patients with low baseline
IgE levels (<43 IU/mL) was significantly higher in Group 2.

Conclusions: Higher doses of omalizumab are effective and safe in patients with CSU that is unresponsive to omalizumab
300 mg. Lower baseline total IgE levels might be used as a predictor of nonresponse to omalizumab and the need for
higher doses.

Introduction Despite the high response rates obtained in studies, there
is still a subset of patients who do not show any improvement with the licensed dose of omalizumab. In this group of
patients, updosing of omalizumab might be a viable alternative before switching to immunosuppressive drugs.
However, studies investigating the effectiveness and safety
of higher doses of omalizumab in patients with CSU and
predictors of the need for updosing are sparse.’ Thus, we
aimed to evaluate the use of higher doses of omalizumab in
our cohort of patients with CSU using validated scores.
Another objective of the study was the identification of
clinical predictors of patients in whom updosing would be
required earlier in the treatment course.

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is characterized by the
occurrence of wheals and/or angioedema for > 6 weeks. The
prevalence of CSU is 0.5% to 1.0% among people age 20-40,
with an average duration of 1-5 years. It has a high burden on
affected individuals, impairing sleep as well as physical and
emotional well-being.'? According to current treatment
guidelines, the first-line treatment option for CSU is a second-generation H1-antihistamine at standard doses. In
patients unresponsive (UR) to these doses, updosing up to
4-fold is recommended.** Despite the regular use of updosed
H1 antihistamines, many patients still suffer from CSU.

Omalizumab is an anti-IgE antibody, and it is a third-line
treatment option in patients with CSU recalcitrant to antihistamines. The recommended dose is 300 mg every 4 weeks
administered subcutaneously.”

Patients and Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted. The study was
approved by our institution’s ethics committee (approval
number: 09.2018.724). The medical charts of patients with
CSU who had been followed up and had received at least 3
doses of omalizumab in our specialized urticaria outpatient
clinic between 2016 and 2018 were reviewed. Of them, the
patients showing CR to omalizumab 300 mg comprised
Group |. Group 2 consisted of patients UR to 300 mg omalizumab and who had at least 3 courses of omalizumab 450
mg. Medical charts of the patients were reviewed and the
patients’ demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics (gender, age, BMI, atopy, comorbidities, disease duration, coexisting chronic inducible urticaria/angioedema,
previous treatments, baseline levels of total IgE, D dimer,
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), high-sensitivity CRP,
omalizumab dose, frequency, maximum dose interval for
omalizumab, concomitant treatments, adverse effects (AEs),
UAS7, and Urticaria Control Test [UCT] scores) were
recorded. Baseline and follow-up UAS7 and UCT scores of
the patients in Group 2 were compared to assess the effectiveness of the omalizumab at higher doses. The baseline
demographic, disease, and treatment characteristics of
Group | vs 2 were also compared.

In our specialized outpatient clinic, demographic information, disease characteristics, and baseline laboratory tests
of all patients are recorded using a standardized form at the
initial visit. The patients with CSU UR to antihistamines up
to 4-fold of standard doses for = 6 months are administered
omalizumab. The standard protocol for omalizumab treatment is 300 mg every 4 weeks administered subcutaneously.
The patients are followed up every 4-8 weeks depending on
the severity of disease and control of symptoms. Following
the first 3 treatments, the dosing interval is increased gradually in patients with CR or good disease control (GDC). In
case of a partial or no response after 6 months of treatment
or any worsening during follow-up, we either combine
omalizumab with immunomodulatory agents, such as colchicine and dapsone, or increase the omalizumab dose to
450 mg every 4 weeks or switch to treatment with cyclosporine. The patients are asked to complete the UAS7 inbetween follow-up visits to evaluate disease severity. The
daily UAS is the sum of scores for intensity of itch and number of wheals. Thus, the daily UAS ranges between 0 and 6,
and the UAS7 from 0 to 42.'° Treatment response is categorized as CR (UAS7=1), GDC (1<UAS7=6), partial
response (PR; UAS7 > 6, but = 10 points of decrease from
baseline), or UR (no change or increase in UAS7)."'
Moreover, at every follow-up visit, patients are asked to
complete the UCT for the assessment of disease control. The
UCT is an easy-to-administer, self-reported questionnaire
assessing disease control in patients with CSU, and it provides a final score between 0 and 16. A score of 12 or more
indicates a well-controlled disease.'”

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA),
v21.0. Descriptive data were shown as n (%) and mean + SD
(range) for categorical variables and quantitative variables,
respectively. The chi-squared test and Student t-test were
used for the comparison of 2 categorical variables and means
between 2 independent samples, respectively. The comparison between 2 measurements within the same sample was
performed with a paired-samples t-test.

Results

The medical records of 136 patients who had been followed
up in our urticaria outpatient clinic during the study period
were reviewed. Of them, 59 patients showing CR to omalizumab 300 mg (Group 1) and 13 patients treated with omalizumab 450 mg (= 3 courses) following unresponsiveness to
omalizumab 300 mg (Group 2) were included in the study.

The comparison of the 2 groups’ demographic, clinical
characteristics, and mean baseline laboratory tests failed to
reveal any statistically significant differences. The patients
were grouped according to baseline total IgE levels as high
or low IgE, based on a previously reported threshold (43 IU/
mL)."° The rate of patients with low IgE levels was significantly higher in Group 2 (60% vs 18.2%, P=.006). Of note,
the percentage of active smokers was higher in Group 2
(46.2% vs 21.2%, P=.067).

The baseline characteristics of the groups are summarized
in Table 1.

In Group 2, updosing was administered following a mean
number of 8.2 treatments with omalizumab 300 mg.
Following a mean number of 4.31 treatments with 450 mg,
mean UAS7 decreased from 18.69 to 5.15 and the mean UCT
scores increased from 8.62 to 12 (P=.003 and .031, respectively) (Figure 1). Treatment with 450 mg omalizumab led to
CR in 6 patients (46.2%) and GDC in 3 patients (23.1%).
Two patients had PR and 2 patients had no response. The
treatment characteristics of group 2 are detailed in Table 2.
No AEs were observed during the study period.

Discussion

The results of the present study have demonstrated an additional benefit of updosing of omalizumab to 450 mg in patients
with inadequate response to licensed doses of omalizumab.
Omalizumab is a third-line treatment option for antihistamine-resistant CSU with high response rates reported in RCTs
and real-life studies.**'*'? A good safety profile, even on
long-term use up to 4 years, has also been demonstrated.'*'*
Treatment with omalizumab is recommended to be continued
for 3-6 months because in some patients, so-called “slow
responders,” achieving CR or GDC might take a longer time."

monthly, switching to immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs might be considered. In addition, despite the limited
number of studies, the literature data suggest that the use of
omalizumab at shorter intervals or higher doses in this group
of patients might be of additional benefit.

In our study, the mean change in the UAS7 and UCT
scores were —13.53 and +5 points, respectively. In addition
to a statistically significant change in the UAS7 and UCT
scores with treatment, the mean changes were over the minimal important difference of 10 points and 3 points for UAS7
and UCT, respectively.'’?? Overall, we observed a CR
(UAS7 = 1) or GDC (1<UAS7 <6) in 69.3% of patients
treated with omalizumab 450 mg monthly, indicating better

control of CSU with updosing of omalizumab to 450 mg.
Consistent with our findings, in 2 multicentre studies investigating the effect of updosing in patients not responding to
omalizumab 300 mg monthly, an additional beneficial effect
was obtained in 64% and 71% of the patients treated with
450 mg or 600 mg monthly.** In another study, shorter intervals and/or updosing led to CR in 8 patients partially responding to licensed doses.’ More recently, a UCT score > 12 was
achieved with updosing to 450 mg and 600 mg in 76.4% and
59% of patients.” In line with the existing data, updosing was
well tolerated in all patients without any AEs.

The decision to updose was made after a mean number of
8.2 treatments in our patients. Similarly, the mean number of

treatment courses was 6 in previous studies.”” These findings
are consistent with the recommendation of waiting 6 months
to evaluate the response to omalizumab."!

The demographic and clinical predictors of better disease
control with updosing were also investigated in this study.
The rate of patients with low IgE levels (<43 IU/mL) was
significantly higher in the updosing group, in accordance
with the existing literature suggesting that low baseline IgE
levels have a high negative predictive value for response to
omalizumab.'*?!” Although these findings should be confirmed in larger, prospective studies, we believe updosing
earlier, or even starting treatment with higher doses, might be
a reasonable option in patients with low baseline IgE levels
(<43 IU/mL). Also, albeit not statistically significant, the
higher rate of smokers among patients requiring updosing
for disease control is worth mentioning. Although baseline
IgE levels were not different between smokers and nonsmokers in our cohort, smokers have been reported to have higher
levels of total IgE compared to nonsmokers.”* However,
higher levels of total IgE are linked to a better response to
omalizumab.””® Thus, it is unlikely that IgE elevation in
smokers would be a contributing factor to the need for higher
doses of omalizumab. Moreover, previous studies failed to
show any effect of smoking on the prognosis or exacerbation
of CSU.’”*§ It can be speculated that inflammation and coagulation induced by smoking might have resulted in more
severe disease and a need for a higher omalizumab dose for
adequate disease control.””*° We think it would be of interest
to investigate the effects of smoking on treatment outcomes
in a larger group of patients.

In contrast to our findings, patients with a shorter duration of
disease, lower baseline UAS7/UCT scores, or a higher BMI
were more likely to improve with updosing in previous
reports.“*° The discrepancy between these results might be
attributed to the relatively small sample size in the present study.

The use of omalizumab with intervals shorter than 4 weeks
has previously been evaluated in 2 studies reporting better
control of symptoms, particularly in patients experiencing
recurrence during the last days of 4-week intervals.*'**

 

 

The current study is limited by its retrospective nature and
relatively small sample size. Nevertheless, the use of validated methods (UAS7 and UCT) to evaluate treatment effectiveness provides valuable information on a subject that has
not been studied in detail.

In this study, updosing of omalizumab provided disease control in patients who remained symptomatic with omalizumab
treatment at the licensed dose. Moreover, our results support the
predictive value of baseline IgE levels for response to omalizumab. We believe updosing is an effective and safe treatment
option in patients with PR or no response to omalizumab after 6
months. Prospective RCTs investigating the effectiveness and
safety of updosing in larger populations are needed.
