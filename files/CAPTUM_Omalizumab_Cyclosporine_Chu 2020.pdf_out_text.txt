ABSTRACT

Background: Chronic urticaria (CU) is a condition characterized by recurrent itchy hives and/or
angioedema for >6 weeks. Most of the data about CU come from western countries with very little
information available about CU in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.

Methods: AWARE-AMAC is a 24-month prospective, observational, real-world, non-interventional study in patients aged >18 years from Asia, the Middle East, and Africa (AMAC) with CU
refractory to H1-antihistamines (H1-AH). The main objective was to describe the real-world
experience with CU, including clinical characteristics, presence of angioedema, treatment patterns
(shifts between treatment classes and changes within a treatment class), investigator-assessed
disease control, and the impact on quality of life. Subgroups of interest were type of CU at
Baseline and treatment class (based on 2013 urticaria guidelines). There were no mandatory visits
and diagnostic/monitoring procedures additional to routine practice, except the patient diary (7day Urticaria Activity Score) and patient reported outcome assessments.

Results: The focus of the current manuscript is on patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria
(CSU), who formed 98% of the sample. Patients were predominantly female (69.6% female, mean
age + SD 39.8 + 13.29 years). Time since current diagnosis (Mean + SD) was 28.6 + 49.06 months.
Amongst patients with CSU, 31.0% had comorbid chronic inducible urticaria (CINDU) and 46.4%
had a history of angioedema. 91.9% received H1-AH therapy (+other treatments). The most
frequently prescribed treatment classes at Baseline were any/combination of medications, not
classified under the other 7 treatment classes, named “Others” (30.5%) followed by, omalizumab
(OMA; 23.6%) and second-generation H1-AH monotherapy (sgAH; 15.1%). At Month 12, the most
prescribed treatment classes (>15%) for patients were OMA (23.5%) and "Other" (21.3%); 19.7%
received "No drug". At Month 24, OMA (22.5%), and "Other" (17.9%) were most frequently
prescribed; 28.6% received "No drug". Overall, 79.5% of patients had some type of change in

treatment. Over the study period, improvement in self-reported QoL increased, which was

mirrored by better disease control.

Conclusion: In AMAC countries, the non-recommended "Other" treatment class played a major
role in the initial management of CU patients. High usage of H1-AH (+other treatments) and OMA
was observed. Treatment changes were observed in a majority of patients. Treatment escalation
from sgAH was mostly via OMA. Improvement of disease control and Qol was achieved during the

study period.
Trial registration: Observational study (NA).

INTRODUCTION

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a condition characterized by the development of wheals (hives), and/or
angioedema, for longer than 6 weeks.’ The
estimated prevalence of CU is up to 1% in the
general population worldwide,’ with those aged
between 30 and 50 years most commonly
affected, and females affected approximately
twice as often as males.?°> The prevalence of CU
in Asia has shown an increasing trend, with recent
reports of 3.08% in Korea, and 0.79% in Taiwan.©”
CU is divided into two types: chronic spontaneous
urticaria (CSU), in which symptoms occur without
specific identifiable external triggers, and chronic
inducible urticaria (CINDU), in which symptoms
are induced and where types include cold, heat,
solar, delayed pressure, vibratory,
dermographism, aquagenic, cholinergic, and
contact urticaria." CSU is more common than
CINDU and accounts for about two-thirds of all CU
cases.’ Patients may concurrently experience CSU
and CINDU in approximately 20% of cases.* CSU
is unpredictable and debilitating with a significant
negative impact on patients’ quality of life (QoL),
including work productivity loss and absenteeism,
interference with sleep and daily activities, and
high levels of anxiety and psychological
distress.27-™1 Furthermore, angioedema
associated with CU may result in significant QoL
impairment,?"° due to greater CSU activity,
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and productivity impairment, and resource utilization.17"%

 

 

In 2013 and 2017, revisions and updates of the
international EAACI/GA7LEN/EDF/WAO consensus
guideline on urticaria were published.**"®
According to the 2013 EAACI/GA7LEN/EDF/WAO
guideline (relevant at the time of the present
study), all CSU patients with symptoms
nsufficiently controlled by the approved dose of
H1-AH (first-line) for 2-4 weeks should be updosed to 2-4x the approved dose (second-line),
followed by add-on therapy with omalizumab,
montelukast or cyclosporine (third-line).1° H1ntihistamines (H1-AH) have long been the stanard of care in CSU,1%7%17 but up to 60% of
atients remain uncontrolled at the approved
ose."® Nearly half remain symptomatic even on
x the approved dose of second-generation H1AH, implying that a significant proportion of the
patient population are negatively impacted despite
being treated.'? To improve symptom control and
minimize disease burden among CU patients, the
international guidelines recommended a stepwise
treatment approach.'*"5 Poor adherence to
urticaria treatment guidelines has been reported,
suggesting that patients may be sub-optimally
managed.?°?? Understanding disease burden
and treatment patterns in patients with urticaria in
real-world settings is critical in enabling measures
to mitigate the impact of urticaria.

The majority of published data on H1-refractory
CU are limited to patient populations derived from
specialized urticaria centers and thus may not be
representative of the general population of
Volume 13, No. 4, Month 2020

patients with CU. To collect data on the management of a representative sample of CU patients
across the world, the AWARE - (A World-wide
Antihistamine-Refractory chronic urticaria patient
Evaluation) program through non-interventional,
prospective observational studies - was
designed. The studies were independently conducted in Europe, Latin America, and, Asia, the
Middle East, and Africa (AMAC). AWARE-AMAC
was a 24-month prospective, observational, realworld, non-interventional study in H1-AH refractory CU (HRCU) patients in the AMAC region.
Here we present key results from AWARE-AMAC
pertaining to clinical characteristics, role of
angioedema, treatment patterns, investigatorassessed disease control, and impact on Qol at
Baseline. While the study included both CSU and
CINDU patients, the current publication focuses on
data from H1-AH refractory CSU patients due to
the small number of CINDU patients included.

METHODS
Study design

Enrollment of patients in the AWARE-AMAC
study occurred between 25 October 2014 and
30 September 2015 from 14 countries (Algeria,
Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan,
Lebanon, Oman, Saudi Arabia, South Africa,
Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and UAE). Patients were
included if they had a confirmed diagnosis of CU,
defined as recurrent episodes of wheals (hives),
angioedema, or both, for at least 2 months and if
they showed a presence of signs and/or symptoms
of CU that were not controlled by at least 2 weeks
treatment with H1-AH. Patients were also required
to be > 18 years of age and to have provided
informed consent. Patients were excluded if they
were participating, or planning to participate, in an
interventional clinical study for CU. The selection o
the treatment for CSU was clearly separated from
the decision to include patients in the study, and
was made at the discretion of the treating physician in accordance with local standard medica
practice and the investigator's clinical judgment.
Information on angioedema _ episodes was
collected by the investigators at each visit and reported in the eCRF with intensity of mild/moderate
or severe. As the study is an observational one, no
diagnostic or monitoring procedures additional to

 

standard care and routine practice were performed for the purpose of the study, except for the
patient's diary (7-day Urticaria Activity Score UAS7) and patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessments. In order to prevent selection bias, investigators had to offer enrollment to all
consecutive patients who met study criteria, were
likely to be available for the full duration of the
follow-up period, and who were willing to participate in the study. The majority of the treating
physicians were allergologists or dermatologists.
Study visit intervals were not fixed per protocol but
adhered to the site's regular practice in this indication. A patient was considered to have
completed the study if they were followed for at
least the planned 24 months (46 weeks); otherwise, they were considered as having prematurely
discontinued.

 

Outcomes

The main objectives of AWARE-AMAC were to
describe the clinical characteristics of H1antihistamines refractory chronic urticaria (HRCU)
patients in the AMAC region: type of urticaria,
presence of angioedema/comorbidities, diagnostic procedures performed, treatment patterns
of HRCU, including the classes of prescribed
treatments, initial doses & dose adjustments,
treatment duration, and shifts between treatment
classes; shifts from one treatment class to another,
changes in medication (dose/frequency changes
within the same treatment class). The assessments
included clinical evolution of HRCU patients,
assessed in terms of symptom control (Physician
Global Assessment of disease control (PhyGAVAS), angioedema episodes, and spontaneous
remission; clinical evolution in the cohort of patients with the diagnosis of CSU — including CSU
with concomitant CINDU; and impact of HRCU on
QoL measured with the Dermatology Life Quality
Index (DLQI). Four subgroups were defined based
on Baseline CU diagnosis: CiNDU, total CSU,
which was further divided into CSU with angioedema and CSU without angioedema. Patients who
had experienced angioedema due to CU either in
the past or at Baseline were included in the CSU
with angioedema subgroup, while the CSU without
angioedema subgroup consisted of patients who
had not experienced angioedema due to CU
either in the past or at Baseline. Seven treatment

classes were defined to reflect treatment guidelines in effect at the time of the study in the
following order (Fig. 1): (1) second-generation H1AH (sgAH) - monotherapy approved dose: once
daily or as needed; (2) updosed secondgeneration H1-AH (sgAHUP) - monotherapy
updosed, i.e. not taken once daily or as needed;
(3) first-generation AH, (fgAH) - monotherapy, or in
combination with sgAH; (4) cyclosporine A (CsA) monotherapy, or in combination with any H1-AH,
with or without steroids; (5) omalizumab (OMA) monotherapy, or in combination with any H1-AH,
with or without steroids; (6) montelukast (MONT) monotherapy, or in combination with any H1-AH,
with or without steroids; (7) systemic glucocorticosteroids (SGC) - monotherapy, or in combination
with any H1-AH."* There were a further 2 treatment
classes defined as "Other" and "No drug". The
"Other" treatment class consisted of any other
medication, or combination of medications, not
classified in the 7 treatment classes defined
above, and "No drug" refers to patients not on
any CU-related treatment.

39.8 + 13.29 years. Unless otherwise mentioned,
the results presented are for CSU patients. As expected for the region, most patients were either of
Caucasian (53.1%; 478/901) or Asian origin
(38.3%; 345/901). The average time since diagnosis of disease prior to enrollment was 6.6 + 7.73
years, with the mean + SD time since current
diagnosis 28.6 + 49.06 months. In total, 45.4%
(409/901) had a diagnosis of CSU with angioedema at Baseline and 54.6% (492/901) had a
diagnosis of CSU without angioedema at Baseline.

At Baseline, nearly all CSU patients were on
treatment (99.9%); only 1 patient was not on
treatment, having stopped previous treatment 1
day prior to Baseline and initiated a new treatment
on day 1 of the study and was therefore included
in the analysis. Most (91.9% [828/901]) CSU patients received H1-AH (either as monotherapy or in

combination) at some point during the study, of
which 74.8% (674/901) were on sgAH (monotherapy or in combination with another therapy).
At Baseline, the predominant treatment classes
(>20% of all CSU patients) were "Other" (30.5
[275/901]), and OMA (23.6% [213/901]). Only
15.1% (136/901) and 12.4% (112/901) received
sgAH and sgAHUP monotherapy, respectively. The
most common treatments in the treatment class
"Other" were H1-AHs taken in conjunction with
other medications, which excluded them from the
monotherapy treatment classes. These combinations included, H1-AH combined with: H2antihistamines (approximately 23%); topical treatments (approximately 16%), other therapies
(approximately 15%). Of the individual medications which contribute to the "Other" treatment
class at Baseline, the most common were ranitidine, cetirizine, fexofenadine, desloratadine and
whole blood.

At Month 12, 12.8% (106/826) of CSU patients
received sgAH, and 11.5% (95/826) received
sgAHUP, respectively. The most common treatment class at Month 12 was OMA with 23.5% (194/
826) followed by "Other" treatment (21.3% [176/

826]), as opposed to Baseline, where "Other" was
the most common treatment class (Fig. 2).
Consistent with the trend at Month 12, at Month
24, OMA remained the most common treatment
class (22.5% [161/717]), followed by "Other"
(17.9% [128/717)). It is noteworthy that during the
study, the proportion of CSU patients in the "No
drug" treatment class increased from 0.1% (1/
901), to 19.7% (163/826) at Month 12, and to
28.6% (205/717) at Month 24. These changes
may be explained by an improvement in CSU

symptom control of CSU patients in the
population.
The longest total mean duration of use for CSU

 

patients of a drug class during the study was for
OMA (458.6 + 261.90 days since Baseline). Prolonged use (mean + SD duration of use:
194.3 + 255.07 days since Baseline) of SGC was
observed. sgAHUP was associated with a duration
of use (mean + SD) of 273.2 + 237.58 (Table 2).
During the study, 34.0% CSU patients (306/901)
did not shift treatment class, and in the OMA
treatment class 47.4% (101/213) did not shift
treatment class (Table 3). Amongst patients who
shifted, 13.2% (18/136) of patients on sgAH and

18.8% (21/112) of patients on sgAHUP shifted to
OMA. Most CSU patients who were shifted to
another treatment class were shifted to "Other"
or OMA and no CSU patients were shifted to
MONT, while all the CSU patients on CSA at
Baseline were shifted to other therapies. The
majority of CSU patients on sgAH and sgAHUP
stayed on them. For those who shifted, most
were shifted to "No drug" (41.9% and 29.5%
respectively), and fewer than 18.4% of patients

on sgAH were up-dosed.

CSU patients were most often reported to have
had a change in treatment regimen (dose or frequency of administration), because of lack of efficacy (39.6%; 357/901), if the medication was no
longer required (31.9%; 287/901), due to disease
improvement (28.5%; 257/901), or other reasons

(28.6%; 258/901).

Disease burden

At Baseline, 16.5% (149/901) of CSU patients
had an occurrence of angioedema, which
decreased to 13.0% (52/401) at Month 12, and
further to 8.8% (25/284) at Month 24. During the
entire study duration, 32.1% (289/901) of CSU
patients experienced an occurrence of angioedema. In the CSU with or without angioedema
subgroups 60.9% (249/409) of patients with a
diagnosis of CSU with angioedema at Baseline
experienced angioedema during the study and
8.1% (40/492) of CSU patients diagnosed without
angioedema at Baseline experienced angioedema
during the study period. The number of angioedema episodes, intensity and average duration
reduced over time. This was reflected in the
improvement the disease control in patients with
CSU at Month 12 and further by Month 24
compared to Baseline when measured with
PhyGA-VAS, and total in clinic UAS score (henceforth referred to as UAS score). Similar results were
seen in the UAS7 scores between Month 12 and
Month 24. Overall, the PhyGA-VAS score in patients with CSU increased notably at Month 12 vs.
Baseline, indicating that by Month 12 patients
experienced improved disease control; this
continued from Month 12-24 (Fig. 3). Both sgAH
and sgAHUP consistently showed high mean
PhyGA-VAS scores (>80) from Month 12. onwards. SGC were the least effective treatment class
in terms of mean PhyGA-VAS score. The total mean
UAS score in CSU patients was 2.8 + 1.71 at
Baseline, 1.2 + 1.41 at Month 12 and 1.1 + 1.40 at
onth 24. Disease severity as assessed with in
clinic assessment of hives and pruritus also
demonstrated decreasing disease severity in CSU
patients. No hives were seen in 54% (211/391) and
65.8% (177/269) by Month 12 and 24 respectively
vs. 19.3% (166/860) of patients assessed at Baseine. Similarly, mild-moderate pruritus was seen in
46.8% (183/391) patients at Month 12, and 43.5%
(117/269) at Month 24 vs. 66.9% (575/860) at
Baseline.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

An increase in the proportion of CSU patients
remaining asymptomatic without treatment, and
an increase in those achieving spontaneous
remission demonstrated an improvement in the
disease status of CSU patients. None of the CSU
patients were asymptomatic without treatment at

Baseline. At Month 12 and 24, 12.1% (100/826)
and 23.0% (165/717) of CSU patients were
asymptomatic without treatment. Spontaneous
remission (defined as complete remission of
signs and symptoms of CU for a period longer
than 6 months as collected in the eCRF) showed
an increasing trend through the study. At Months
12 and 24, 5.2% (43/826) and 19.2% (138/717) of
CSU patients had achieved spontaneous remission. 0.1% (1/826) CSU patients who had achieved remission had suffered from a recurrence
at Month 12, while 1.5% (11/717) patients suffered recurrence of disease at Month 24 (see Fig.
4). Consequent to the improvement in disease
control, the impact of CSU on patients’ QoL as
measured by DLQI, decreased over time, with
the individual subscales (symptoms and
feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and
school, personal relationships, and treatment)
also showing a reduction in scores both at
Month 12 and Month 24, compared to Baseline
(Table 4).

 

DISCUSSION

The 2-year results from AWARE-AMAC study
confirm that CU has a significant impact on the
QoL of patients, including impact on work.?*24
While there is a considerable burden of urticaria,
there is an unmet need for real-world clinical
data about CU patients from high-quality, large
scale, observational studies.22:24 The
demographics of patients analyzed were
comparable to those from other CU clinical
trials.1%?5.2 A similar proportion of patients
were diagnosed as having CSU with angioedema
at Baseline (45.4%) to that typically reported
[phase Ill clinical trials: 41.0%?5; AWARE. in
Europe: 46.1%; AWARE in Central and South
America: 50.8%].2” A high percentage of CSU
patients had concomitant CINDU (31.0%) in the
AMAC region. The corresponding proportion was
22.0% in AWARE study in Europe and 30.0% in
Central and South America.?”

According to the 2013 EAACI/GA?LEN/EDF/
WAO guideline (relevant at the time of the
AWARE-AMAC study), first-line treatment with
second-generation H1-antihistamines was recommended, followed by an increase in dose (up to 4Volume 13, No. 4, Month 2020

management of CSU in real-world settings may not
sufficiently comply with guidelines.2°??:27
Prolonged use of SGC, and use of sgAH (either
as monotherapy or in combination) in CSU
patients for duration exceeding that
recommended by guidelines and relatively high
proportions of patients on fgAH in the AMAC
region confirms that better awareness of
treatment guidelines is required.

Disease severity was assessed using the PhyGAVAS. Patients with the highest mean PhyGA-VAS
scores were frequently not on treatment at the
time of the PhyGA-VAS assessment. This could
indicate that their previous treatment was highly
effective, or, that there was disease disappearance, or, spontaneous remission. At Month 24,
spontaneous remission had occurred in nearly
20% of CSU patients, and only 1.5% of CSU patients had relapsed after spontaneous remission.
The rate of spontaneous remission must be seen
in view of the fact that 135 CSU patients were lost
to follow-up, implying the exact rate of spontaneous remission might have been higher. The rate
of spontaneous remission in this study is low
compared to the literature-reported rate of 30%50%.°

The current study provides a reflection of
clinical treatment practices in a real-world practice setting in the included countries. The data

are from a well-designed study in a large cohort
of patients who were followed up for up to 24
months, thus offering significant scope for
recognizing trends in treatment over time, and
not just a snapshot of clinical practice at a specific time point. This is especially important, as
the data come from a region of the world where
scant data about CU treatment in real world
practice are published.

The study had a few limitations. The only inclusion criteria applied, next to the patient providing
informed consent and age >18 years, were a
medically confirmed diagnosis of CU with symptoms of more than 2 months, and signs and/or
symptoms of CU that were not adequately
controlled by at least 2 weeks treatment with H1AHs. It is also worth noting that the presentation
of symptoms of CU may lead to visits to physicians,
and by extension it is possible for patients not
experiencing symptoms being either lost to followup or not being assessed at certain timepoints.
Thus, outcomes may be affected due to the
missing data from this subset of patients. As is
generally the case with non-interventional studies,
no explicit exclusion criteria apart from simultaneous participation in an interventional clinical
study were applied. There was no set visit
schedule, therefore the number of assessment
points fluctuated during the study. Patients

the usual CU patients, as the inclusion criteria
requested that patients were willing to be followed
up for 2 years.

The primary aim of AWARE-AMAC was to collect
real-world evidence on disease burden and treatment patterns in patients with HRCU. This goal was
achieved by evaluating more than 900 patients
across 14 AMAC countries. Although patients with
CINDU were also included in the study, this manuscript focuses on patients with a diagnosis of CSU.
The study did not scrutinize specific medicinal

were currently treated in the AMAC region. Over the
24-month study period, the proportion of patients
with self-reported improved QoL increased. This
was mirrored by positive developments in disease
control. Prolonged use of systemic steroid monotherapy, beyond the recommended guidelines for
steroid use, was also observed in the region. The
non-guideline-recommended "Other" treatment
class was used in a considerable proportion of patients. Treatment escalation from the first- and
second-line guideline-recommended treatments of
12 Chu et al. World Allergy Organization Journal (2020) 13:100117

sgAH was mostly performed via OMA, with other
third-line treatments being used less frequently.
These findings suggest limited adherence to
guidelines and highlights the need for better
awareness of the guidelines.

CONCLUSIONS

The AWARE-AMAC study shed light on realworld practice regarding the diagnosis and
management of CU in >900 patients for 24
months from the AMAC countries for the first
time. In the AMAC region, patients were similar
to those in other regions from a demographic
perspective, and there were a similar percentage
of patients with CSU + angioedema compared to
other regions. Yet the AMAC region had a higher
percentage of patients with comorbid CINDU
than other regions. In the AMAC region, limited
adherence to CU management guidelines was
observed which highlights the need for better
awareness of the guidelines. In this study there
was a low percentage of spontaneous remission
which might be due to high number patients lost
to follow-up. The majority of patients had escalation of therapy over the treatment period
mostly to omalizumab. There was improvement
in disease control reflected in increase QoL
scores.
