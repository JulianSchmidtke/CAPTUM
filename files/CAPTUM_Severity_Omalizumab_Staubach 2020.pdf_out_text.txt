ABSTRACT

This is a retrospective study of 18 children with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), where standard
therapies, including up-dosing of antihistamines and omalizumab, were unable to cure the disease
and where alternative strategies with experimental and off-label medication had to be used.
Materials: Being aware that our questionnaire is validated only for elder children or adults, we utilized the UAS7 to monitor disease control with the help of the parents.

Results: The UAS7 score decreased from a mean of 25 to an average of 13 after 8 weeks of therapy
in 13 patients. Five patients had no significant reduction of UAS7 by week 8. In two of five patients,
where periodic improvement was seen, omalizumab therapy was continued and showed complete
response after 1-2 years. In three children, alternative treatments with cyclosporine and dupilumab,
approved by the ethics committee, showed symptom improvement from a mean UAS7 of 29 to a
mean value of 6.

Conclusions: When omalizumab therapy including up-dosing strategies or shortened interval shows
no symptom improvement, alternative therapies, sometimes off-label have to be considered in time.

1. Introduction

According to the international guidelines, chronic urticaria (CU)
is a common skin disease in adults and children. Autoimmune
pathways are being discussed. Overall, triggers and causes like
infection, medication, autoimmune disease and rare food allergens should be ruled out when therapy is unsuccessful.
Prevalence of CU among children, although rare compared to
adults, remains a therapeutic challenge. In most cases, an external cause cannot be identified (1).

The international guideline recommends that the disease has
to be treated immediately while looking for possible causes and
triggers. The first-line treatment for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is second-generation antihistamines and if not effective, dosage should be increased up to fourfold. Safety data are
available for children and adults (2,3). If antihistamine therapy
fails, omalizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody, is an effective and safe second-line option (2). It was first
approved in 2014 for treatment of urticaria in patients 12 years
and older, but has been in clinical trials and is meanwhile
approved for asthmatic children (from the age of 6) (4). The
exact mechanism of action of omalizumab is still a matter of
debate (5).

Like in adults, not all patients respond sufficient to those
treatment options. Five out of 18 children in the age of
6-17 years showed no initial improvement to omalizumab. Offlabel therapy was applied due to severity of symptoms and after

approval of the ethics committee. All children were non-responders to different first-line second generation antihistamines
(including up-dosing therapeutic strategies) and received blood
testing including measurements of IgE levels before starting
omalizumab therapy.

2. Materials and methods

The UAS7 Questionnaire is a disease specific tool to assess disease activity in urticaria patients. It can be used to measure
treatment response (6). The advantage of this tool is, that the
disease activity is registered every day, so that the therapy
response and the duration of the response can be monitored.

The urticaria activity was measured with the help of the
parents using the UAS7 before start of omalizumab and at every
consecutive visit (every 4 weeks).

An UAS7 of 0 was rated as symptom free, an UAS7 of 0-6 as
well-controlled. The minimal clinically important difference
(MCID) in the UAS7 score was rated in accordance to literature
with a reduction of 9.5-10.5 points (6).

3. Results

Eighteen children suffered from CSU, all children were unsuccessfully treated with one or more second generation antihistamines including up-dosing until fourfold approved dosage
(weight-adapted) before starting omalizumab. Five children

were under the age of 12. On average, UAS7 scores decreased
from 24.6 (range 7-42) before therapy to 10.4 (range 0-36) after
8 weeks in 13 of 18 successfully treated children (Figure 1)
(online resource Table 1).

In five of these 18 children, omalizumab response was
delayed for more than 12 months or off-label alternatives had
to be administered in order to achieve symptom control (online
resource Table 2).

All off-label use was indicated due to the severity of symptoms, and approved by the ethics committee. There were not
any mentionable side effects in this cohort.

Five patients treated with omalizumab had no to minimal
reduction of UAS7 after week 8 (UAS7 range: 24-36). In two of
those five non/late-responders, who did not show satisfying disease control at first, we decided to continue treatment with
omalizumab. The decision to continue treatment was based on
intermittent improvement of the UAS7 score, according to the
MCID. The two children reached stable disease control
(UAS7 <6) after 1 year (UAS7=4) and after 2 years (UAS7 =0).

In all five children, additional blood testing for autoimmunity
(thyroid autoantibodies and tryptase elevation) and an autologous skin serum test (ASST) were performed. The ASST showed
no abnormality; however, thyroid antibodies were positive in
one child. In three patients, omalizumab therapy failed, even
after up-dosing (450 or 600mg) and/or interval shortening and
long-term treatment. They were treated with cyclosporine for
3 months with a dosage of 3-4mg/kg bodyweight, which led to
symptom relieve in one patient and was discontinued after
3 months of treatment with no relapse (7).

In the two remaining patients, who showed inadequate
response to cyclosporine (3-4mg kg/body weight), off-label
treatment with dupilumab 300mg (an anti-IL 4/IL-13 antibody),
licensed in atopic dermatitis, was started as mentioned in literature (8). One non-responder, with very high levels of IgE
(3528 kU/I) and atopic disease (Figure 2), did not show
adequate treatment response to cyclosporine, but significant
improvement of symptoms after 4 weeks of dupilumab (week 8:
UAS7 = 0). The therapy decision was made based on the high
IgE-level. The other patient showed only slight improvement
under dupilumab treatment at first, but symptoms improved
after 3 months of therapy.

4. Discussion

Due to the international urticaria guidelines, the gold standard
treating urticaria in children, adolescents, and adults are second
generation antihistamines up to a fourfold dosage (weightadapted). If there is a lack of response, omalizumab is approved
for CSU or CombU (12 years and older).

The highest evidence for treatment in CSU patients exists for
omalizumab - mostly in adults and only in a small cohort for
adolescents from the age of 12. If omalizumab fails, cyclosporine
is an alternative treatment option even in children (9).

In our outpatient clinic, on average we see about 100
children with urticaria every year. Mostly, they respond well to
first-line therapy including up-dosing second generation antihistamines to the fourfold licensed dosage (weight-adapted).

In two patients, late response to omalizumab was seen. This
observation had been made previously and reported in adult
studies (10). In general, if there was a partial response after
3-6 months, we continued treatment like other groups (11). A
periodically increased dosage or a shortened interval was
applied during the course of treatment, depending on occurrence of symptoms during or at the end of the treatment interval.

It is known, that patients with autoimmune disease show
sometimes limited benefit from an omalizumab therapy (12,13).
In our pediatric cohort, autoimmune thyroiditis was present in
one out of three children non-respondent to omalizumab.
Neither up-dosing, cycle-shortening strategies nor cyclosporine
and substitution of thyroid hormones resolved the problem. It
was the off-label use of dupilumab, an IL-4/IL-13 antagonist,
which led to significant improvement and is currently in trial for
treatment of CSU (8).

The reason for late response to omalizumab in two children,
might have been a high IgE-level, although there are reports
stating the opposite (14). Retrospectively, treatment with dupilumab might have resulted in earlier symptom control. In
children with a high level of IgE, who show no improvement to
omalizumab nor cyclosporine, dupilumab 200mg or 300mg

weight-adapted every 2 weeks, may be an option. Moreover,
cyclosporine is not recommended for long-term treatment.

Our experience shows, that for some, but not all patients
with CSU, omalizumab is a safe and effective add-on treatment
for a prolonged period of time. After increasing the dosage up
to 450/600 mg in non-responders (weight-adapted) or shortening of the interval, alternative treatment protocols, even
off-label, have to be kept in mind. In our case, this involved
treatment with cyclosporine and/or dupilumab. Since 2019, new
monoclonal antibodies such as ligelizumab are in trial for children age 12 and older (15), their efficacy has to be seen.
Unfortunately, until today, no validated disease-specific scores
are available to rate the burden of disease in children.
