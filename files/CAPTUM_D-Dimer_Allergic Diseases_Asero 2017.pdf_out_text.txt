Clinical Implications

e D-dimer and prothrombin fragment F 1+2 are much
more frequently elevated in patients with chronic

spontaneous urticaria showing an early response to
omalizumab than in late responders and nonresponders,
suggesting that the activation of the coagulation cascade
characterizes a specific subset of the disease.

TO THE EDITOR:

The coagulation cascade is activated via the extrinsic pathway
in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) with an intensity that
parallels disease severity.'> In severe cases, the activation is
intense enough to lead eventually to massive thrombin generation and to the detection of elevated D-dimer plasma levels. An
elevated D-dimer plasma level has been found to be a viable
biomarker in CSU, being associated both with a poor response to
antihistamines’ and with a limited response to cyclosporine
treatment.” The humanized monoclonal anti-lgE antibody
omalizumab is an effective treatment for patients with severe
CSU not responding to antihistamines at higher than licensed
doses. However, a proportion of patients do not respond to antiIgE therapy, and the reasons for this are unclear. Interestingly,
D-dimer plasma levels parallel the clinical response to omalizumab treatment, dropping in responders and remaining
unchanged in nonresponders.” In this study, we assessed whether
baseline D-dimer plasma levels are able to predict the clinical
response to omalizumab.

Seventy-four adults (mean age 49 years, range 15-78 years; M/
F 26/48) with severe CSU unresponsive to second-generation
antihistamines at up to 4 times licensed dose (urticaria activity
score [UAS 7] > 30; mean disease duration 49 months; range
2-540 months) were studied. We included all the patients submitted to omalizumab at our centers so far. All patients underwent a course of subcutaneous omalizumab 300 mg every 4
weeks for at least 3 months. Based on the response to omalizumab, patients were classified as “early responders” (showing a
dramatic reduction of UAS 7 to at least <14 as short as 3-7 days
after the first administration), “late responders” (UAS 7 reduction to at least <20 only after 2-3 months of treatment), or
“nonresponders” (symptoms remaining unchanged after 3 shots
of the drug). Baseline D-dimer plasma levels were measured in
all patients 1 to 7 days before the first dose of omalizumab by
means of ELISA (Zymutest D-dimer; Hyphen BioMed,
Neuville-sur-Oise, France). The intra- and interassay coefficients
of variation (CVs) were 10% and 15%, respectively. Levels below
500 ng/mL were regarded as normal. In 27 patients, we also

 

 

 

 

measured baseline plasma levels of prothrombin fragment F 1+2
by a sandwich ELISA (Enzygnost F112; Behring Diagnostics,
Frankfurt, Germany). Intraassay and interassay CVs were 5%
and 8%, respectively. The differences between groups were
evaluated by Mann-Whitney nonparametric tests for independent samples; probability values of <.05 were considered. statistically significant. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve analysis was performed. For statistical analysis, the SPSS
statistical package, version 23.00 (IBM SPSS, Chicago, Ill) was
used. All patients agreed with the treatment regimen and signed a
written consent. The local review boards approved the study, and
in view of its observational nature, a formal ethical committee
approval was not requested.

Overall, the rate of clinical response to omalizumab was 82%
(61/74). Forty-eight (65%) patients were classified as early responders, 13 (18%) as late responders, and 13 (18%) as nonresponders. No difference in sex distribution and age and disease
duration was found between the three subgroups. Baseline
D-dimer plasma levels were elevated in 52 of 74 (70.3%) patients
but with a different distribution in the 3 subgroups: 43 of 48
(89.6%) in early responders, 7 of 13 (53.8%) in late responders,
and 5 of 13 (38.5%) in nonresponders. Early responders showed
significantly higher mean baseline D-dimer levels (mean 1536
ng/mL, 95% confidence interval [CI] 968-2104 ng/mL) than
both late responders (mean 705, 95% CI 362-1048) (P = .011)
and nonresponders (mean 524 ng/mL, 95% CI 316-732 ng/mL)
(P = .031) (Figure 1), whereas no difference was detected between the 2 latter subgroups. The same picture was observed in
the 27 patients in whom baseline prothrombin fragment F 1+2
was measured, with early responders showing significantly higher
levels than both late responders and nonresponders (P = .024
and P = .020, respectively), with the latter 2 groups that did not
show any significant difference (Figure 2). A direct linear correlation was present between F 1+2 and D-dimer plasma levels
(r = 0.809, P = .0001). According to the ROC curve analysis,
the threshold value of plasma D-dimer that better discriminated
between responders and late/nonresponders to omalizumab was
475 ng/mL (sensitivity 91.5%, specificity 63.8%, positive predictive value 78.2%, negative predictive value 77.8%). The area
under the curve was 0.714 (95% CI 0.587-0.842). In the
responder group, we found an inverse correlation between
baseline levels of D-dimer and time to response (r = —0.411,
P = .007).

The clinical response of patients with severe CSU to omalizumab administration is variable, with a majority of subjects
showing a prompt disappearance of symptoms after as short as a
ew days after the first shot, and the remaining responding slowly
or not responding at all. To date no predictive marker exists for
the outcome of this expensive treatment. D-dimer levels are
requently elevated in patients with CSU not responding to
antihistamines or cyclosporine and parallel the clinical response
to omalizumab.”” In this study, elevated baseline D-dimer
plasma levels were significantly associated with a prompt
response to anti-IgE therapy, and the association between
coagulation activation and early response to anti-IgE was
confirmed by fragment F 1+2 data. These observations suggest
that CSU might in effect include different diseases characterized

by an identical clinical phenotype but different endotypes. This
is most evident when we consider the clinically different responses to antihistamines, omalizumab, and cyclosporine. The
activation of the coagulation cascade, demonstrated by high
plasma levels of D-dimer, may be due to a crosstalk with
inflammation that is frequently observed in patients with severe
CSU.‘ However, inflammation is not always present in patients
with CSU; in fact, approximately 30% of the patients included
in this study (also with baseline UAS 7 > 30) had normal
baseline D-dimer levels. In a recent study, a slow (“late”)
response to omalizumab was associated with autoreactivity, as

detected by positive autologous serum skin test and/or positive
basophil histamine release assay." Notably, the proportion of
“late responders” detected in that study is similar to that of patients showing autoantibodies to IgE or to the high-affinity IgE
receptor (FceRI).” Interestingly, we found that late responders
and nonresponders to omalizumab were similar in terms of the
activation of the coagulation cascade. Thus, CSU associated with
elevated D-dimer plasma levels might represent an endotype
characterized by the activation of inflammation pathways that
makes the patients more responsive to omalizumab treatment. It
is apparently contradictory that patients with CSU are not reported to be at risk for thrombotic events despite an increased
activation of the coagulation cascade. A possible explanation is
that the activation of coagulation occurs extravascularly and can
be efficiently counteracted by fibrinolysis. Several early
responders to omalizumab treatment showed normal baseline Ddimer levels; however, it should be considered that D-dimer is
much less sensitive than the prothrombin fragment F 1+2 in
detecting the activation of coagulation cascade. In effect, only 1
of 17 early responders showed an F 1+2 level within the normal
range (Figure 2), suggesting that coagulation was activated in the
large majority of early responders to omalizumab. Altogether, it
seems possible to conclude that D-dimer appears to be a positive
predictive marker for the clinical response to anti-IgE therapy,
although its normality does not exclude it. In our series, sex, age,
and duration of disease did not affect the clinical response to
omalizumab. Although larger studies are needed to confirm our
findings, in many cases, elevated D-dimer plasma levels seem to
mark a subset of patients with CSU characterized by a severe
disease that often do not respond to antihistamines or even
cyclosporine, but frequently show a prompt and complete
response to anti-IgE.
